While still in his teens, he was able to determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals, thereby solving a problem standing for 350 years. His work laid the foundations for Galois theory and group theory, two major branches of abstract algebra, and the subfield of Galois connections. He died at age 20 from wounds suffered in a duel.\nLife.\nEarly life.\nGalois was born on 25 October 1811 to Nicolas-Gabriel Galois and Ad\u00e9la\u00efde-Marie (n\u00e9e Demante). His father was a Republican and was head of Bourg-la-Reine's liberal party. His father became mayor of the village after Louis XVIII returned to the throne in 1814. His mother, the daughter of a jurist, was a fluent reader of Latin and classical literature and was responsible for her son's education for his first twelve years.\nIn October 1823, he entered the Lyc\u00e9e Louis-le-Grand, At the age of 14, he began to take a serious interest in mathematics.\nHe found a copy of Adrien-Marie Legendre's \"\u00c9l\u00e9ments de G\u00e9om\u00e9trie\", which, it is said, he read \"like a novel\" and mastered at the first reading. At 15, he was reading the original papers of Joseph-Louis Lagrange, such as the \"R\u00e9flexions sur la r\u00e9solution alg\u00e9brique des \u00e9quations\" which likely motivated his later work on equation theory, and \"Le\u00e7ons sur le calcul des fonctions\", work intended for professional mathematicians, yet his classwork remained uninspired, and his teachers accused him of \"affecting\" ambition and originality in a negative way.\nBudding mathematician.\nIn 1828, he attempted the entrance examination for the \u00c9cole Polytechnique, the most prestigious institution for mathematics in France at the time, without the usual preparation in mathematics, and failed for lack of explanations on the oral examination. In that same year, he entered the \u00c9cole Normale (then known as l'\u00c9cole pr\u00e9paratoire), a far inferior institution for mathematical studies at that time, where he found some professors sympathetic to him.\nIn the following year Galois' first paper, on continued fractions, was published. It was at around the same time that he began making fundamental discoveries in the theory of polynomial equations. He submitted two papers on this topic to the Academy of Sciences. Augustin-Louis Cauchy refereed these papers, but refused to accept them for publication for reasons that still remain unclear. However, in spite of many claims to the contrary, it is widely held that Cauchy recognized the importance of Galois' work, and that he merely suggested combining the two papers into one in order to enter it in the competition for the Academy's Grand Prize in Mathematics. Cauchy, an eminent mathematician of the time, though with political views that were at the opposite end from Galois', considered Galois' work to be a likely winner.\nOn 28 July 1829, Galois' father died by suicide after a bitter political dispute with the village priest. A couple of days later, Galois made his second and last attempt to enter the Polytechnique, and failed yet again. It is undisputed that Galois was more than qualified; however, accounts differ on why he failed. More plausible accounts state that Galois made too many logical leaps and baffled the incompetent examiner, which enraged Galois. The recent death of his father may have also influenced his behavior.\nHaving been denied admission to the \u00c9cole polytechnique, Galois took the Baccalaureate examinations in order to enter the \u00c9cole normale. He passed, receiving his degree on 29 December 1829. His examiner in mathematics reported, \"This pupil is sometimes obscure in expressing his ideas, but he is intelligent and shows a remarkable spirit of research.\"\nHe submitted his memoir on equation theory several times, but it was never published in his lifetime due to various events. Though his first attempt was refused by Cauchy, in February 1830 following Cauchy's suggestion he submitted it to the Academy's secretary Joseph Fourier, to be considered for the Grand Prix of the Academy. Unfortunately, Fourier died soon after, and the memoir was lost. The prize would be awarded that year to Niels Henrik Abel posthumously and also to Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi. Despite the lost memoir, Galois published three papers that year, one of which laid the foundations for Galois theory. The second one was about the numerical resolution of equations (root finding in modern terminology). The third was an important one in number theory, in which the concept of a finite field was first articulated.\nPolitical firebrand.\nGalois lived during a time of political turmoil in France. Charles X had succeeded Louis XVIII in 1824, but in 1827 his party suffered a major electoral setback and by 1830 the opposition liberal party became the majority. Charles, faced with political opposition from the chambers, staged a coup d'\u00e9tat, and issued his notorious July Ordinances, touching off the July Revolution which ended with Louis Philippe becoming king. While their counterparts at the Polytechnique were making history in the streets during \"les Trois Glorieuses\", Galois, at the \u00c9cole Normale was locked in by the school's director. Galois was incensed and wrote a blistering letter criticizing the director, which he submitted to the \"Gazette des \u00c9coles\", signing the letter with his full name. Although the \"Gazette\"s editor omitted the signature for publication, Galois was expelled.\nAlthough his expulsion would have formally taken effect on 4 January 1831, Galois quit school immediately and joined the staunchly Republican artillery unit of the National Guard. He divided his time between his mathematical work and his political affiliations. Due to controversy surrounding the unit, soon after Galois became a member, on 31 December 1830, the artillery of the National Guard was disbanded out of fear that they might destabilize the government. At around the same time, nineteen officers of Galois' former unit were arrested and charged with conspiracy to overthrow the government.\nIn April 1831, the officers were acquitted of all charges, and on 9 May 1831, a banquet was held in their honor, with many illustrious people present, such as Alexandre Dumas. The proceedings grew riotous. At some point, Galois stood and proposed a toast in which he said, \"To Louis Philippe,\" with a dagger above his cup. The republicans at the banquet interpreted Galois' toast as a threat against the king's life and cheered. He was arrested the following day at his mother's house and held in detention at Sainte-P\u00e9lagie prison until 15 June 1831, when he had his trial. Galois' defense lawyer cleverly claimed that Galois actually said, \"To Louis-Philippe, \"if he betrays\",\" but that the qualifier was drowned out in the cheers. The prosecutor asked a few more questions, and perhaps influenced by Galois' youth, the jury acquitted him that same day.\nOn the following Bastille Day (14 July 1831), Galois was at the head of a protest, wearing the uniform of the disbanded artillery, and came heavily armed with several pistols, a loaded rifle, and a dagger. He was again arrested. During his stay in prison, Galois at one point drank alcohol for the first time at the goading of his fellow inmates. One of these inmates, Fran\u00e7ois-Vincent Raspail, recorded what Galois said while drunk in a letter from July 25. Excerpted from the letter: \nThe first line is a haunting prophecy of how Galois would in fact die; the second shows how Galois was profoundly affected by the loss of his father. Raspail continues that Galois, still in a delirium, attempted suicide, and that he would have succeeded if his fellow inmates hadn't forcibly stopped him. Months later, when Galois' trial occurred on 23 October, he was sentenced to six months in prison for illegally wearing a uniform. While in prison, he continued to develop his mathematical ideas. He was released on 29 April 1832.\nFinal days.\nGalois returned to mathematics after his expulsion from the \u00c9cole Normale, although he continued to spend time in political activities. After his expulsion became official in January 1831, he attempted to start a private class in advanced algebra which attracted some interest, but this waned, as it seemed that his political activism had priority. Sim\u00e9on Denis Poisson asked him to submit his work on the theory of equations, which he did on 17 January 1831. Around 4 July 1831, Poisson declared Galois' work \"incomprehensible\", declaring that \"[Galois'] argument is neither sufficiently clear nor sufficiently developed to allow us to judge its rigor\"; however, the rejection report ends on an encouraging note: \"We would then suggest that the author should publish the whole of his work in order to form a definitive opinion.\" While Poisson's report was made before Galois' July 14 arrest, it took until October to reach Galois in prison. It is unsurprising, in the light of his character and situation at the time, that Galois reacted violently to the rejection letter, and decided to abandon publishing his papers through the Academy and instead publish them privately through his friend Auguste Chevalier. Apparently, however, Galois did not ignore Poisson's advice, as he began collecting all his mathematical manuscripts while still in prison, and continued polishing his ideas until his release on 29\u00a0April 1832, after which he was somehow talked into a duel.\nGalois' fatal duel took place on 30 May. The true motives behind the duel are obscure. There has been much speculation as to the reasons behind it. What is known is that, five days before his death, he wrote a letter to Chevalier which clearly alludes to a broken love affair.\nSome archival investigation on the original letters suggests that the woman of romantic interest was St\u00e9phanie-F\u00e9licie Poterin du Motel, the daughter of the physician at the hostel where Galois stayed during the last months of his life. Fragments of letters from her, copied by Galois himself (with many portions, such as her name, either obliterated or deliberately omitted), are available. The letters hint that du Motel had confided some of her troubles to Galois, and this might have prompted him to provoke the duel himself on her behalf. This conjecture is also supported by other letters Galois later wrote to his friends the night before he died. Galois' cousin, Gabriel Demante, when asked if he knew the cause of the duel, mentioned that Galois \"found himself in the presence of a supposed uncle and a supposed fianc\u00e9, each of whom provoked the duel.\" Galois himself exclaimed: \"I am the victim of an infamous coquette and her two dupes.\"\nMuch more detailed speculation based on these scant historical details has been interpolated by many of Galois' biographers (most notably by Eric Temple Bell in \"Men of Mathematics\"), such as the frequently repeated speculation that the entire incident was stage-managed by the police and royalist factions to eliminate a political enemy.\nAs to his opponent in the duel, Alexandre Dumas names Pescheux d'Herbinville, who was actually one of the nineteen artillery officers whose acquittal was celebrated at the banquet that occasioned Galois' first arrest. However, Dumas is alone in this assertion, and if he were correct it is unclear why d'Herbinville would have been involved. It has been speculated that he was du Motel's \"supposed fianc\u00e9\" at the time (she ultimately married someone else), but no clear evidence has been found supporting this conjecture. On the other hand, extant newspaper clippings from only a few days after the duel give a description of his opponent (identified by the initials \"L.D.\") that appear to more accurately apply to one of Galois' Republican friends, most probably Ernest Duchatelet, who was imprisoned with Galois on the same charges. Given the conflicting information available, the true identity of his killer may well be lost to history.\nWhatever the reasons behind the duel, Galois was so convinced of his impending death that he stayed up all night writing letters to his Republican friends and composing what would become his mathematical testament, the famous letter to Auguste Chevalier outlining his ideas, and three attached manuscripts. Mathematician Hermann Weyl said of this testament, \"This letter, if judged by the novelty and profundity of ideas it contains, is perhaps the most substantial piece of writing in the whole literature of mankind.\" However, the legend of Galois pouring his mathematical thoughts onto paper the night before he died seems to have been exaggerated. In these final papers, he outlined the rough edges of some work he had been doing in analysis and annotated a copy of the manuscript submitted to the Academy and other papers.\nEarly in the morning of 30 May 1832, he was shot in the abdomen, was abandoned by his opponents and his own seconds, and was found by a passing farmer. He died the following morning at ten o'clock in the H\u00f4pital Cochin (probably of peritonitis), after refusing the offices of a priest. His funeral ended in riots. There were plans to initiate an uprising during his funeral, but during the same time frame the leaders heard of General Jean Maximilien Lamarque's death, and the rising was postponed without any uprising occurring until 5 June. Only Galois' younger brother was notified of the events prior to Galois' death. He was 20 years old. His last words to his younger brother Alfred were:\nOn 2 June, \u00c9variste Galois was buried in a common grave of the Montparnasse Cemetery whose exact location is unknown. In the cemetery of his native town \u2013 Bourg-la-Reine \u2013 a cenotaph in his honour was erected beside the graves of his relatives.\nIn 1843 Joseph Liouville reviewed his manuscript and declared it sound. It was finally published in the October\u2013November 1846 issue of the \"Journal de Math\u00e9matiques Pures et Appliqu\u00e9es\". The most famous contribution of this manuscript was a novel proof that there is no quintic formula \u2013 that is, that fifth and higher degree equations are not generally solvable by radicals. Although Niels Henrik Abel had already proved the impossibility of a \"quintic formula\" by radicals in 1824 and Paolo Ruffini had published a solution in 1799 that turned out to be flawed, Galois' methods led to deeper research in what is now called Galois theory. For example, one can use it to determine, for \"any\" polynomial equation, whether it has a solution by radicals.\nContributions to mathematics.\nFrom the closing lines of a letter from Galois to his friend Auguste Chevalier, dated May 29, 1832, two days before Galois' death:\nWithin the 60 or so pages of Galois' collected works are many important ideas that have had far-reaching consequences for nearly all branches of mathematics. His work has been compared to that of Niels Henrik Abel, another mathematician who died at a very young age, and much of their work had significant overlap.\nAlgebra.\nWhile many mathematicians before Galois gave consideration to what are now known as groups, it was Galois who was the first to use the word \"group\" (in French \"groupe\") in a sense close to the technical sense that is understood today, making him among the founders of the branch of algebra known as group theory. He developed the concept that is today known as a normal subgroup. He called the decomposition of a group into its left and right cosets a \"proper decomposition\" if the left and right cosets coincide, which is what today is known as a normal subgroup. He also introduced the concept of a finite field (also known as a Galois field in his honor), in essentially the same form as it is understood today.\nIn his last letter to Chevalier and attached manuscripts, the second of three, he made basic studies of linear groups over finite fields:\nGalois theory.\nGalois' most significant contribution to mathematics is his development of Galois theory. He realized that the algebraic solution to a polynomial equation is related to the structure of a group of permutations associated with the roots of the polynomial, the Galois group of the polynomial. He found that an equation could be solved in radicals if one can find a series of subgroups of its Galois group, each one normal in its successor with abelian quotient, or its Galois group is solvable. This proved to be a fertile approach, which later mathematicians adapted to many other fields of mathematics besides the theory of equations to which Galois originally applied it.\nAnalysis.\nGalois also made some contributions to the theory of Abelian integrals and continued fractions.\nAs written in his last letter, Galois passed from the study of elliptic functions to consideration of the integrals of the most general algebraic differentials, today called Abelian integrals. He classified these integrals into three categories.\nContinued fractions.\nIn his first paper in 1828, Galois proved that the regular continued fraction which represents a quadratic surd \"\u03b6\" is purely periodic if and only if \"\u03b6\" is a reduced surd, that is, formula_1 and its conjugate formula_2\nsatisfies formula_3.\nIn fact, Galois showed more than this. He also proved that if \"\u03b6\" is a reduced quadratic surd and \"\u03b7\" is its conjugate, then the continued fractions for \"\u03b6\" and for (\u22121/\"\u03b7\") are both purely periodic, and the repeating block in one of those continued fractions is the mirror image of the repeating block in the other. In symbols we have\nwhere \"\u03b6\" is any reduced quadratic surd, and \"\u03b7\" is its conjugate.\nFrom these two theorems of Galois a result already known to Lagrange can be deduced. If \"r\"\u00a0&gt;\u00a01 is a rational number that is not a perfect square, then\nIn particular, if \"n\" is any non-square positive integer, the regular continued fraction expansion of \u221a\"n\" contains a repeating block of length \"m\", in which the first \"m\"\u00a0\u2212\u00a01 partial denominators form a palindromic string."}

{"id": "9820", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9820", "title": "Ennius", "text": "Quintus Ennius (; c. 239 \u2013 c. 169 BC) was a writer and poet who lived during the Roman Republic. He is often considered the father of Roman poetry. He was born in Rudiae, formerly a small town located near modern Lecce in the heel of Italy (ancient Calabria, today Salento), and could speak Oscan as well as Latin and Greek. Although only fragments of his works survive, his influence in Latin literature was significant, particularly in his use of Greek literary models.\nBiography.\nVery little is reliably known about the life of Ennius. His contemporaries hardly mentioned him and much that is related about him could have been embroidered from references to himself in his now fragmentary writings. Some lines of the \"Annales\", as well as ancient testimonies, for example, suggest that Ennius opened his epic with a recollection of a dream in which the ancient epic-writer Homer informed him that his spirit had been reborn into Ennius. It is true that the doctrine of the transmigration of souls once flourished in the areas of Italy settled by Greeks, but the statement might have been no more than a literary flourish. Ennius seems to have been given to making large claims, as in the report by Maurus Servius Honoratus that he claimed descent from Messapus, the legendary king of his native district. The partly Hellenised city of Rudiae, his place of birth, was certainly in the area settled by the Messapians. And this, he used to say, according to Aulus Gellius, had endowed him with a triple linguistic and cultural heritage, fancifully described as \"three hearts\u2026 Greek, Oscan and Latin\".\nThe public career of Ennius first really emerges in middle life, when he was serving in the army with the rank of centurion during the Second Punic War. While in Sardinia in the year 204 BC, he is said to have attracted the attention of Cato the Elder and was taken by him to Rome. There he taught Greek and adapted Greek plays for a livelihood, and by his poetical compositions gained the friendship of some of the greatest men in Rome whose achievements he praised. Amongst these were Scipio Africanus and Fulvius Nobilior, whom he accompanied on his Aetolian campaign (189). Afterwards he made the capture of Ambracia, at which he was present, the subject of a play and of an episode in the \"Annales\". It was through the influence of Nobilior's son Quintus that Ennius subsequently obtained Roman citizenship. But he himself lived plainly and simply in the literary quarter on the Aventine Hill with the poet Caecilius Statius, a fellow adapter of Greek plays.\nAt about the age of 70 Ennius died, immediately after producing his tragedy \"Thyestes\". In the last book of his epic poem, in which he seems to have given various details of his personal history, he mentioned that he was in his 67th year at the date of its composition. He compared himself, in contemplation of the close of the great work of his life, to a gallant horse which, after having often won the prize at the Olympic Games, obtained his rest when weary with age. A similar feeling of pride at the completion of a great career is expressed in the memorial lines which he composed to be placed under his bust after death: \u201cLet no one weep for me, or celebrate my funeral with mourning; for I still live, as I pass to and fro through the mouths of men.\u201d\nLiterature.\nEnnius continued the nascent literary tradition by writing plays in Greek and Roman style (praetextae and palliatae), as well as his most famous work, a historic epic in hexameters called the \"Annales\". Other minor works include the \"Epicharmus\", \"Epigrammata\", the \"Euhemerus\", the \"Hedyphagetica\", \"Praecepta\"/\"Protrepticus\", \"Saturae\" (or \"Satires\"), \"Scipio\", and \"Sota\".\nThe \"Annales\".\nThe \"Annales\" was an epic poem in fifteen books, later expanded to eighteen, covering Roman history from the fall of Troy in 1184 BC down to the censorship of Cato the Elder in 184 BC. It was the first Latin poem to adopt the dactylic hexameter metre used in Greek epic and didactic poetry, leading it to become the standard metre for these genres in Latin poetry. The \"Annals\" became a school text for Roman schoolchildren, eventually supplanted by Virgil's \"Aeneid\". About 600 lines survive. A copy of the work is among the Latin rolls of the Herculaneum library.\nMinor works.\nThe \"Epicharmus\" was inspired by the philosophical hypotheses developed by the Sicilian poet and philosopher Epicharmus of Kos, after which Ennius's work took its name. In the \"Epicharmus\", the poet describes a dream he had in which he died and was transported to some place of heavenly enlightenment. Here, he met Epicharmus, who explained the nature of the gods and taught Ennius the physics of the universe.\nThe \"Euhemerus\" presented a theological doctrine based on the ideas Greek of Euhemerus of Messene, who argued that the gods of Olympus were not supernatural powers that interference in the lives of humans, but rather heroes of old who after death were eventually regarded as deities due to their valor, bravery, or cultural impact (this belief is now known as euhemerism). Both Cicero and Lactantius write that the \"Euhemerus\" was a \"translat[ion] and a recount[ing]\" of Euhemerus's original work the \"Sacred History\", but it is unclear if this means Ennius simply translated the original from Greek into Latin, or added in his own elements. Most of what is preserved of this work comes to us from Lactantius, and these snippets suggest that the \"Euhemerus\" was a prose text.\nThe \"Hedyphagetica\" took much of its substance from the gastronomical epic of Archestratus of Gela. The extant portions of Ennius's poem discuss where a reader might find the best type of fish. Most of the fragments, replete with unique terms for fish and numerous place names, are corrupt or damaged. The \"Hedyphagetica\" is written in hexameters, but differs from the \"Annales\" in regards to \"metrical practices\"; this difference is largely due to each works' distinct subject matter.\nThe titles \"Praecepta\" and \"Protrepticus\" were likely used to refer to the same (possibly exhortatory) work. However, given this work's almost non-existent nature (only the word \"pannibus\"an \"unusual\" form of the word \"pannis\", meaning \"rags\"is preserved in the work of the Latin grammarian Charisius), this position is extremely difficult to verify.\nThe \"Saturae\" is a collection of about thirty lines from satirical poemsmaking it the first extant instance of Roman satire. These lines are written in a variety of poetic metres. The poems in this collection \"were mostly concerned with practical wisdom, often driving home a lesson with the help of a fable.\"\nEnnius's \"Scipio\" was a work (possibly a panegyric poem) that apparently celebrated the life and deeds of Scipio Africanus. Hardly anything remains of this work, and what is preserved is embedded in the works of others. Unfortunately, \"no quotation of [\"Scipio\"] supplies a context\". Some have proposed that the work was written before the \"Annales\", and others have said that the work was written after Scipio's 201 BC triumph that followed the Battle of Zama (202 BC).\nThe \"Sota\" was a poem, potentially of some length, named after the Greek poet Sotades. The work, which followed a metre established by Sotades known as the \"Sotadeus\", concerned itself with a number of disparate topics and ideas."}

{"id": "9823", "revid": "37869476", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9823", "title": "Eris (mythology)", "text": "Eris (; ', \"Strife\") is the Greek goddess of strife and discord. Her Roman equivalent is Discordia, which means the same. Eris's Greek opposite is Harmonia, whose Roman counterpart is Concordia. Homer equated her with the war-goddess Enyo, whose Roman counterpart is Bellona. The dwarf planet Eris is named after the goddess.\nShe had no temples in ancient Greece (Concordia had several in Italy), and functions essentially as a personification, as which she appears in Homer and many later works.\nEtymology.\n\"Eris\" is of uncertain etymology; connections with the verb \u1f40\u03c1\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd \"orinein\", \"to raise, stir, excite,\" and the proper name \u1f18\u03c1\u03b9\u03bd\u03cd\u03b5\u03c2 \"Erinyes\" have been suggested. R. S. P. Beekes rejects these derivations and suggested a Pre-Greek origin.\nCharacteristics in Greek mythology.\nIn Hesiod's \"Works and Days\" 11\u201324, two different goddesses named Eris are distinguished:\n&lt;poem&gt;So, after all, there was not one kind of Strife alone, but all over the earth there are two. As for the one, a man would praise her when he came to understand her; but the other is blameworthy: and they are wholly different in nature. For one fosters evil war and battle, being cruel: her no man loves; but perforce, through the will of the deathless gods, men pay harsh Strife her honour due.\nBut the other is the elder daughter of dark Night (Nyx), and the son of Cronus [i.e. Zeus] who sits above and dwells in the aether, set her in the roots of the earth: and she is far kinder to men. She stirs up even the shiftless to toil; for a man grows eager to work when he considers his neighbour, a rich man who hastens to plough and plant and put his house in good order; and neighbour vies with his neighbour as he hurries after wealth. This Strife is wholesome for men. And potter is angry with potter, and craftsman with craftsman and beggar is jealous of beggar, and minstrel of minstrel.&lt;/poem&gt;\nIn Hesiod's \"Theogony\" (226\u2013232), Strife, the daughter of Night, is less kindly spoken of as she brings forth other personifications as her children:\nThe other Strife is presumably she who appears in Homer's \"Iliad\" Book\u00a0IV; equated with Enyo as sister of Ares and so presumably daughter of Zeus and Hera:\nStrife whose wrath is relentless, she is the sister and companion of murderous Ares, she who is only a little thing at the first, but thereafter grows until she strides on the earth with her head striking heaven. She then hurled down bitterness equally between both sides as she walked through the onslaught making men's pain heavier. She also has a son whom she named Strife.\nEnyo is mentioned in Book 5, and Zeus sends Strife to rouse the Achaeans in Book 11, of the same work.\nThe most famous tale of Eris recounts her initiating the Trojan War by causing the Judgement of Paris. The goddesses Hera, Athena and Aphrodite had been invited along with the rest of Olympus to the forced wedding of Peleus and Thetis, who would become the parents of Achilles, but Eris had been snubbed because of her troublemaking inclinations.\nShe therefore (as mentioned at the \"Kypria\" according to Proclus as part of a plan hatched by Zeus and Themis) tossed into the party the Apple of Discord, a golden apple inscribed \u00a0\u2013 \"For the most beautiful one\", or \"To the Fairest One\"\u00a0\u2013 provoking the goddesses to begin quarreling about the appropriate recipient. The hapless Paris, Prince of Troy, was appointed to select the fairest by Zeus. The goddesses stripped naked to try to win Paris's decision, and also attempted to bribe him. Hera offered political power; Athena promised infinite wisdom; and Aphrodite tempted him with the most beautiful woman in the world: Helen, wife of Menelaus of Sparta. While Greek culture placed a greater emphasis on prowess and power, Paris chose to award the apple to Aphrodite, thereby dooming his city, which was destroyed in the war that ensued.\nIn Nonnus's \"Dionysiaca\", 2.356, when Typhon prepares to battle with Zeus:\nEris (\"Strife\") was Typhon's escort in the mel\u00e9e, Nike (\"Victory\") led Zeus to battle.\nAnother story of Eris includes Hera, and the love of Polytekhnos and Aedon. They claimed to love each other more than Hera and Zeus were in love. This angered Hera, so she sent Eris to wreak discord upon them. Polytekhnos was finishing off a chariot board, and Aedon a web she had been weaving. Eris said to them, \"Whosoever finishes thine task last shall have to present the other with a female servant!\" Aedon won. But Polytekhnos was not happy by his defeat, so he came to Khelidon, Aedon's sister, and raped her. He then disguised her as a slave, presenting her to Aedon. When Aedon discovered this was indeed her sister, she chopped up Polytekhnos's son and fed him to Polytekhnos. The gods were not pleased, so they turned them all into birds.\nCultural influences.\nDiscordianism.\nEris has been adopted as the patron deity of the modern Discordian religion, which was begun in the late 1950s by Gregory Hill and Kerry Wendell Thornley under the pen names of \"Malaclypse the Younger\" and \"Omar Khayyam Ravenhurst\". The Discordian version of Eris is considerably lighter in comparison to the rather malevolent Graeco-Roman original, wherein she is depicted as a positive (albeit mischievous) force of chaotic creation. \"Principia Discordia\", the first holy book of Discordianism, states:\nThe story of Eris being snubbed and indirectly starting the Trojan War is recorded in the \"Principia\", and is referred to as the Original Snub. The \"Principia Discordia\" states that her parents may be as described in Greek legend, or that she may be the daughter of Void. She is the Goddess of Disorder and Being, whereas her sister Aneris (called the equivalent of Harmonia by the Mythics of Harmonia) is the goddess of Order and Non-Being. Their brother is Spirituality.\nDiscordian Eris is looked upon as a foil to the preoccupation of western philosophy in attempting find order in the chaos of reality, in prescribing order to be synonymous with truth. Discordian Eris teaches us that the only truth is chaos, and that order and disorder are simply temporary filters applied to the lenses we view the chaos through.

She also wrote verse-dramas and a highly-praised opera, \"The King's Henchman\". Her novels appeared under the name Nancy Boyd, and she refused lucrative offers to publish them under her own name.\nMillay was a prominent social figure of New York City's Greenwich Village just as it was becoming known as a bohemian writer's colony, and she was noted for her uninhibited lifestyle, forming many passing relationships with both men and women. She was also a social and political activist and those relationships included prominent anti-war activists including Floyd Dell, editor of the radical magazine \"The Masses\", and perhaps John Reed. She became a prominent feminist of her time; her poetry and her example, both subversive, inspired a generation of American women. \nHer career as a poet was meteoric. In 1923 she became the first woman to win the Pulitzer prize in poetry. She became a performance artist super-star, reading her poetry to rapt audiences across the country. \nA road accident in middle-age left her a partial invalid and morphine-dependent for years. Yet near the end of her life, she wrote some of her greatest poetry. \nEarly life.\nMillay was born in Rockland, Maine, to Cora Lounella Buzelle, a nurse, and Henry Tolman Millay, a schoolteacher who would later become a superintendent of schools. Her middle name derives from St. Vincent's Hospital in New York, where her uncle's life had been saved just before her birth. The family's house was \"between the mountains and the sea where baskets of apples and drying herbs on the porch mingled their scents with those of the neighboring pine woods.\" In 1904, Cora officially divorced Millay's father for financial irresponsibility and domestic abuse, but they had already been separated for some years. Henry and Edna kept a letter correspondence for many years, but he never re-entered the family. Cora and her three daughters \u2013 Edna (who called herself \"Vincent\"), Norma Lounella (born 1893), and Kathleen Kalloch (born 1896) \u2013 moved from town to town, living in poverty and surviving various illnesses. Cora travelled with a trunk full of classic literature, including Shakespeare and Milton, which she read to her children. The family settled in a small house on the property of Cora's aunt in Camden, Maine, where Millay would write the first of the poems that would bring her literary fame.\nThe three sisters were independent and spoke their minds, which did not always sit well with the authority figures in their lives. Millay's grade school principal, offended by her frank attitudes, refused to call her Vincent. Instead, he called her by any woman's name that started with a V. At Camden High School, Millay began developing her literary talents, starting at the school's literary magazine, \"The Megunticook\". At 14 she won the St. Nicholas Gold Badge for poetry, and by 15, she had published her poetry in the popular children's magazine \"St. Nicholas\", the \"Camden Herald\", and the high-profile anthology \"Current Literature\".\nMillay entered Vassar College in 1913 when she was 21 years old, later than usual. Her attendance at Vassar became a strain to her due to its strict nature. Before she attended the college Millay had a liberal home life that included smoking, drinking, playing gin rummy, and flirting with men. Vassar, on the other hand, expected its students to be refined and live according to their status as young ladies. She had relationships with many fellow students during her time there and kept scrapbooks including drafts of plays written during the period. While at school, she had several relationships with women, including Edith Wynne Matthison, who would go on to become an actress in silent films.\nNew York City.\nAfter her graduation from Vassar in 1917, Millay moved to New York City. She lived in a number of places in Greenwich Village, including a house owned by the Cherry Lane Theatre and 75\u00bd Bedford Street, renowned for being the narrowest in New York City. While in New York City, Millay lived an openly bisexual lifestyle. The critic Floyd Dell wrote that the red-haired and beautiful Millay was \"a frivolous young woman, with a brand-new pair of dancing slippers and a mouth like a valentine.\" Millay described her life in New York as \"very, very poor and very, very merry.\" While establishing her career as a poet, Millay initially worked with the Provincetown Players on Macdougal Street and the Theatre Guild. In 1924 Millay and others founded the Cherry Lane Theater \"to continue the staging of experimental drama.\" Magazine articles under a pseudonym also helped support her early days in the Village. During her stay in Greenwich Village, Millay learned to use her poetry in her feminist activism. She often went into detail about topics others found taboo, such as a wife leaving her husband in the middle of the night.\nCounted among Millay's close friends were the writers Witter Bynner, Arthur Davison Ficke, and Susan Glaspell, as well as Floyd Dell and the critic Edmund Wilson, both of whom proposed marriage to her and were refused. Millay had a way of wrapping men around her finger, even after she rejected them. Edmund Wilson, for example, spoke of her highly because Millay took his virginity but she recanted his advances and rejected his marriage proposal. However, he remained a loyal friend.\nCareer.\nMillay's fame began in 1912 when, at the age of 20, she entered her poem \"Renascence\" in a poetry contest in \"The Lyric Year\". The poem was widely considered the best submission, and when it was ultimately awarded fourth place, it created a scandal which brought Millay publicity. The first-place winner Orrick Johns was among those who felt that \"Renascence\" was the best poem, and stated that \"the award was as much an embarrassment to me as a triumph.\" A second-prize winner offered Millay his $250 prize money. In the immediate aftermath of the \"Lyric Year\" controversy, wealthy arts patron Caroline B. Dow heard Millay reciting her poetry and playing the piano at the Whitehall Inn in Camden, Maine, and was so impressed that she offered to pay for Millay's education at Vassar College.\nMillay's 1920 collection \"A Few Figs From Thistles\" drew controversy for its exploration of female sexuality and feminism. In 1919, she wrote the anti-war play \"Aria da Capo\", which starred her sister Norma Millay at the Provincetown Playhouse in New York City. Millay won the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1923 for \"The Ballad of the Harp-Weaver\"; she was the third woman to win the poetry prize, after Sara Teasdale (1918) and Margaret Widdemer (1919).\nMillay also wrote short stories for the magazine Ainslee's - but she was a canny protector of her identity as a poet and an aesthete, and insisted on publishing this more mass-appeal work under a pseudonym, Nancy Boyd. As her fame grew and she became a household name, the publisher of Ainslee's offered to double her fees if he could use her real name. She refused.\nIn January 1921, she went to Paris, where she met and befriended the sculptors Thelma Wood and Constantin Brancusi, photographer Man Ray, had affairs with journalists George Slocombe and John Carter, and became pregnant by a man named Daubigny. She secured a marriage license but instead returned to New England where her mother Cora helped induce an abortion with alkanet, as recommended in her old copy of \"Culpeper's Complete Herbal\". Possibly as a result, Millay was frequently ill and weak for much of the next four years.\nAfter experiencing his remarkable attentions to her during her illness, in 1923 she married 43-year-old Eugen Jan Boissevain (1880\u20131949), the widower of the labor lawyer and war correspondent Inez Milholland, a political icon Millay had met during her time at Vassar. A self-proclaimed feminist, Boissevain supported Millay's career and took primary care of domestic responsibilities. Both Millay and Boissevain had other lovers throughout their 26-year marriage. For Millay, one such significant relationship was with the poet George Dillon, a student 14 years her junior, whom she met in 1928 at one of her readings at the University of Chicago. Their relationship inspired the sonnets in the collection \"Fatal Interview\" (published 1931).\nIn 1925, Boissevain and Millay bought Steepletop near Austerlitz, New York, which had once been a blueberry farm. They built a barn (from a Sears Roebuck kit), and then a writing cabin and a tennis court. Millay grew her own vegetables in a small garden. Later, they bought Ragged Island in Casco Bay, Maine, as a summer retreat. Frequently having trouble with the servants they employed, Millay wrote, \"The only people I really hate are servants. They are not really human beings at all.\"\nIn the summer of 1936, Millay was riding in a station wagon when the door suddenly swung open, and Millay \u201cwas hurled out into the pitch-darkness...and rolled for some distance down a rocky gully\" The accident severely damaged nerves in her spine, requiring frequent surgeries and hospitalizations, at least daily doses of morphine. Millay lived the rest of her life in \"constant pain\". Despite this, she was sufficiently alarmed by the rise of fascism to write against it. During World War I, Millay had been a dedicated and active pacifist; however, in 1940 she advocated for the U.S. to enter the war against the Axis and became an ardent supporter of the war effort. She later worked with Writers' War Board to create propaganda, including poetry. Millay's reputation in poetry circles was damaged by her war work. Merle Rubin noted, \"She seems to have caught more flak from the literary critics for supporting democracy than Ezra Pound did for championing fascism.\" In 1942 in \"The New York Times Magazine\", Millay mourned the destruction of the Czechoslovak town of Lidice. Nazi forces had razed Lidice, slaughtered its male inhabitants and scattered its surviving residents in retaliation for the assassination of Reinhard Heydrich. Millay wrote:\n&lt;poem&gt;The whole world holds in its arms today\nThe murdered village of Lidice, \nLike the murdered body of a little child.&lt;/poem&gt;\nThis article would serve as the basis of her 32-page poem, \"Murder of Lidice\", in 1942 and loosely served as the basis of the 1943 MGM movie \"Hitler's Madman\". Douglas Sirk directed the movie. Harper and Brothers published the poem in 1942.\nIn 1943, Millay was the sixth person and the second woman to be awarded the Frost Medal for her lifetime contribution to American poetry.\nDespite the excellent sales of her books in the 1930s, her declining reputation, constant medical bills, and frequent demands from her mentally-ill sister Kathleen meant that for most of her last years, Millay was in debt to her own publisher. Author Daniel Mark Epstein also concludes from her correspondence that Millay developed a passion for thoroughbred horse-racing, and spent much of her income investing in a racing stable of which she had quietly become an owner. \nAlthough her work and reputation declined during the war years, possibly because of a morphine addiction acquired following her accident, she subsequently sought treatment for it and was successfully rehabilitated, with some of her finest work dating from the post-war period. Boissevain died in 1949 of lung cancer, and Millay lived alone for the last year of her life. Her final collection of poems was published posthumously as the volume \"Mine the Harvest\". The title sonnet recalls her career:\n&lt;poem&gt;Those hours when happy hours were my estate, \u2014\nEntailed, as proper, for the next in line,\nYet mine the harvest, and the title mine \u2014\nThose acres, fertile, and the furrows straight,\nFrom which the lark would rise \u2014 all of my late\nEnchantments, still, in brilliant colours, shine,&lt;/poem&gt;\nDeath and legacy.\nMillay died at her home on October 19, 1950. She had fallen down stairs and was found approximately eight hours after her death. Her physician reported that she had suffered a heart attack following a coronary occlusion. She was 58 years old. She is buried alongside her husband at Steepletop, Austerlitz, New York.\nMillay's sister Norma and her husband, the painter and actor Charles Frederick Ellis, moved to Steepletop after Millay's death. In 1973, they established the Millay Colony for the Arts on seven acres near the house and barn. After the death of her husband in 1976, Norma continued to run the program until her death in 1986.\nAt 17, the poet Mary Oliver visited Steepletop and became a close friend of Norma. Later she lived at Steepletop off-and-on for seven years and helped to organize Millay's papers. Mary Oliver herself went on to become a Pulitzer Prize-winning poet, greatly inspired by Millay's work. \nIn 2006, the state of New York paid $1.69 million to acquire of Steepletop, to add the land to a nearby state forest preserve. The proceeds of the sale were used by the Edna St. Vincent Millay Society to restore the farmhouse and grounds and turn it into a museum. The museum opened to the public in the summer of 2010, and guided tours of Steepletop and Millay's gardens were available from the end of May through the middle of October. Effective November 2018 Steepletop closed to the public due to financial challenges and restoration needs. Fundraising efforts continue as do considerations for the future of this museum house.\nParts of the grounds of Steepletop, including the Millay Poetry Trail that leads to her grave, are now open for occasional scheduled events.\nDetails of Millay's life were compiled by biographer Nancy Milford in the book titled \"Savage Beauty: The Life of Edna St Vincent Millay\", published in 2001. Milford was sought out by Millay's only living connection at the time, her sister Norma Millay Ellis, and was chosen for her previous, successful biography \"Zelda\". Milford also edited and wrote an introduction for a collection of Millay's poems called \"The Selected Poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay.\" Milford wrote that \"Millay was the first American figure to rival the personal adulation, frenzy even, of Byron, where the poet in his person was the romantic ideal. It was his life as much as his work that shocked and delighted his audiences. Edna Millay was the only American woman to draw such crowds to her. Her performing self made people feel they had seen the muse alive and just within reach.\" \nIn 2015, Millay was named by Equality Forum as one of their \"31 Icons\" of the 2015 LGBT History Month.\nMillay has been the inspiration for several plays and musicals, including the biographical play \"Words Like Fresh Skin\", written by Megan Lohne and produced at Adelphi University.\nAmerican composer Margaret Bonds arranged \"Six Songs on Poems by Edna St. Vincent Millay\": \"Women Have Loved Before as I Love Now\", \"Hyacinth\", \"Even in the Moment\", \"Feast\", \"I Know My Mind\" and \"What Lips My Lips Have Kissed\".\nIn the 1971 \"All in the Family\" episode \"Judging Books by Covers\", the character Archie Bunker erroneously refers to the poet as \"Edna St. Louis Millay.\"\nIn 1972 the Poem 'Conscientious Objector' by Edna, was put to music by Mary Travers (of Peter, Paul and Mary) on her album 'Morning Glory'.\nIn the 1975 \"The Waltons\" episode \"The Woman\", a female poet visiting the college attended by John Boy quotes Edna St. Vincent Millay, reciting \"The First Fig\":\n\"My candle burns at both ends/\nIt will not last the night/\nBut ah, my foes and oh my friends/\nIt gives a lovely light\"\nIn July 1981, the United States Postal Service issued an 18-cent stamp depicting Edna St. Vincent Millay.\nIn October 2020, Scottish harpist Maeve Gilchrist produced an album entitled \"The Harpweaver\", that owes its origin to a poem by Edna St. Vincent Millay, \"The Ballad of the Harp-Weaver\".\nWorks.\nMillay wrote six verse dramas early in her career, including \"Two Slatterns and a King\" and \"The Lamp and the Bell\", a poem written for Vassar College about love between women. She was commissioned by the Metropolitan Opera House to write a libretto for an opera composed by Deems Taylor. The result, \"The King's Henchman\", drew on the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle's\" account of Eadgar, King of Wessex, and was described as the most effectively and artistically wrought American opera ever to reach the stage. Within three weeks, her publishers had run through four editions of the book.\nHer pacifist verse drama \"Aria da Capo\", a one-act play written for the Provincetown Players, is often anthologized. It aired live as an episode of \"Academy Theatre\" in 1949 on NBC.\n\"\" (1922) is an homage to the geometry of Euclid. \"Renascence\" and \"The Ballad of the Harp-Weaver\" are often considered her finest poems. On her death, \"The New York Times\" described her as \"an idol of the younger generation during the glorious early days of Greenwich Village [...] One of the greatest American poets of her time.\" Thomas Hardy said that America had two great attractions: the skyscraper and the poetry of Edna St. Vincent Millay. The poet Richard Wilbur asserted, \"She wrote some of the best sonnets of the century.\"\nExternal links.\nhttps://www.discogs.com/Mary-Travers-Morning-Glory/release/1714354"}

{"id": "9827", "revid": "25862313", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9827", "title": "Ethnocentrism", "text": "Ethnocentrism in social science and anthropology\u2014as well as in colloquial English discourse\u2014means to apply one's own culture or ethnicity as a frame of reference to judge other cultures, practices, behaviors, beliefs, and people, instead of using the standards of the particular culture involved. Since this judgement is often negative, some people also use the term to refer to the belief that one's culture is superior to, or more correct or normal than, all others\u2014especially regarding the distinctions that define each ethnicity's cultural identity, such as language, behavior, customs, and religion. In common usage, it can also simply mean any culturally biased judgment. For example, ethnocentrism can be seen in the common portrayals of the Global South and the Global North.\nEthnocentrism is sometimes related to racism, stereotyping, discrimination, or xenophobia. However, the term \"ethnocentrism\" does not necessarily involve a negative view of the others' race or indicate a negative connotation. The opposite of ethnocentrism is cultural relativism, which means to understand a different culture in its own terms without subjective judgments.\nThe term \"ethnocentrism\" was first applied in the social sciences by American sociologist William G. Sumner. In his 1906 book, \"Folkways,\" Sumner describes ethnocentrism as \"the technical name for the view of things in which one's own group is the center of everything, and all others are scaled and rated with reference to it.\" He further characterized ethnocentrism as often leading to pride, vanity, the belief in one's own group's superiority, and contempt for outsiders.\nOver time, ethnocentrism developed alongside the progression of social understandings by people such as social theorist, Theodore W. Adorno. In Adorno's \"The Authoritarian Personality\", he and his colleagues of the Frankfurt School established a broader definition of the term as a result of \"in group-out group differentiation,\" stating that ethnocentrism \"combines a positive attitude toward one's own ethnic/cultural group (the in-group) with a negative attitude toward the other ethnic/cultural group (the out-group).\" Both of these juxtaposing attitudes are also a result of a process known as \"social identification\" and \"social counter-identification.\"\nOrigins and development.\nThe term ethnocentrism derives from two Greek words: \"ethnos,\" meaning nation, and \"kentron,\" meaning center. Scholars believe this term was coined by Polish sociologist Ludwig Gumplowicz in the 19th century, although alternate theories suggest that he only popularized the concept as opposed to inventing it. He saw ethnocentrism as a phenomenon similar to the delusions of geocentrism and anthropocentrism, defining Ethnocentrism as \"the reasons by virtue of which each group of people believed it had always occupied the highest point, not only among contemporaneous peoples and nations, but also in relation to all peoples of the historical past.\"\nSubsequently, in the 20th century, American social scientist William G. Sumner proposed two different definitions in his 1906 book \"Folkways.\" Sumner stated that \"Ethnocentrism is the technical name for this view of things in which one's own group is the center of everything, and all others are scaled and rated with reference to it.\" In the \"War and Other Essays (1911)\", he wrote that \"the sentiment of cohesion, internal comradeship, and devotion to the in-group, which carries with it a sense of superiority to any out-group and readiness to defend the interests of the in-group against the out-group, is technically known as ethnocentrism.\" According to Boris Bizumic it is a popular misunderstanding that Sumner originated the term ethnocentrism, stating that in actuality he brought ethnocentrism into the mainstreams of anthropology, social science, and psychology through his English publications.\nSeveral theories have been reinforced through the social and psychological understandings of ethnocentrism including T.W Adorno's Authoritarian Personality Theory (1950), Donald T. Campbell's Realistic Group Conflict Theory (1972), and Henri Tajfel's Social identity theory (1986). These theories have helped to distinguish ethnocentrism as a means to better understand the behaviors caused by in-group and out-group differentiation throughout history and society.\nEthnocentrism in social sciences.\nIn social sciences, ethnocentrism means to judge another culture based on the standard of one's own culture instead of the standard of the other particular culture. When people use their own culture as a parameter to measure other cultures, they often tend to think that their culture is superior and see other cultures as inferior and bizarre. Ethnocentrism can be explained at different levels of analysis. For example, at an intergroup level, this term is seen as a consequence of a conflict between groups; while at the individual level, in-group cohesion and out-group hostility can explain personality traits. Also, ethnocentrism can helps us to explain the construction of identity. Ethnocentrism can explain the basis of one's identity by excluding the outgroup that is the target of ethnocentric sentiments and used as a way of distinguishing oneself from other groups that can be more or less tolerant. This practice in social interactions creates social boundaries, such boundaries define and draw symbolic boundaries of the group that one wants to be associated with or belong to. In this way, ethnocentrism is a term not only limited to anthropology but also can be applied to other fields of social sciences like sociology or psychology.\u00a0 \u00a0\nAnthropology.\nThe classifications of ethnocentrism originate from the studies of anthropology. With its omnipresence throughout history, ethnocentrism has always been a factor in how different cultures and groups related to one another. Examples including how historically, foreigners would be characterized as \"Barbarians,\" or how China believed their nation to be the \"Empire of the Center\" and viewed foreigners as privileged subordinates. However, the anthropocentric interpretations initially took place most notably in the 19th century when anthropologists began to describe and rank various cultures according to the degree to which they had developed significant milestones, such as monotheistic religions, technological advancements, and other historical progressions.\nMost rankings were strongly influenced by colonization and the belief to improve societies they colonized, ranking the cultures based on the progression of their western societies and what they classified as milestones. Comparisons were mostly based on what the colonists believed as superior and what their western societies have accomplished. Thomas Macaulay, an English politician in the 19th Century, attempted to validate the opinion that \"one shelf of a Western library\" had more knowledge then the years of text and literature developed by the Eastern societies. Ideas developed by Charles Darwin has ethnocentric ideals where societies who believed they were superior were most likely to survive and prosper. Edward Said's orientalist concept represented how Western reactions to non-Western societies were based on an \"unequal power relationship\" that Western peoples developed due to colonization and the influence it held over non-Western societies.\nThe ethnocentric classification of \"primitive\" were also used by 19th and 20th century anthropologists and represented how unawareness in cultural and religious understanding changed overall reactions to non-Western societies. Modern anthropologist Sir Edward Burnett Tylor wrote about \"primitive\" societies in \"Primitive Culture\" (1871) creating a \"civilization\" scale where it was implied that ethnic cultures preceded civilized societies. The use of \"savage\" as a classification is modernly known as \"tribal\" or \"pre-literate\" where it was usually referred as a derogatory term as the \"civilization\" scale became more common. Examples that demonstrate a lack of understanding include when European travelers judged different languages based on that fact that they could not understand it and displayed a negative reaction, or the intolerance displayed by Westerners when exposed to unknown religions and symbolisms. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, a German philosopher, justified Western colonization by reasoning that since the non-Western societies were \"primitive\" and \"uncivilized,\" their culture and history was not worth conserving and should allow Westernization.\nAnthropologist Franz Boas saw the flaws in this formulaic approach to ranking and interpreting cultural development and committed himself to overthrowing this inaccurate reasoning due to many factors involving their individual characteristics. With his methodological innovations, Boas sought to show the error of the proposition that race determined cultural capacity. In his 1911 book \"The Mind of Primitive Man\", Boas wrote that:It is somewhat difficult for us to recognize that the value which we attribute to our own civilization is due to the fact that we participate in this civilization, and that it has been controlling all our actions from the time of our birth; but it is certainly conceivable that there may be other civilizations, based perhaps on different traditions and on a different equilibrium of emotion and reason, which are of no less value than ours, although it may be impossible for us to appreciate their values without having grown up under their influence.Together, Boas and his colleagues propagated the certainty that there are no inferior races or cultures. This egalitarian approach introduced the concept of cultural relativism to anthropology, a methodological principle for investigating and comparing societies in as unprejudiced as possible and without using a developmental scale as anthropologists at the time were implementing. Boas and anthropologist Bronis\u0142aw Malinowski argued that any human science had to transcend the ethnocentric views that could blind any scientist's ultimate conclusions.\nBoth had also urged anthropologists to conduct ethnographic fieldwork to overcome their ethnocentrism. To help, Malinowski would develop the theory of functionalism as guides for producing non-ethnocentric studies of different cultures. Classic examples of anti-ethnocentric anthropology include Margaret Mead's \"Coming of Age in Samoa\" (1928), which in time has met with severe criticism for its incorrect data and generalisations, Malinowski's \"The Sexual Life of Savages in North-Western Melanesia\" (1929), and Ruth Benedict's \"Patterns of Culture\" (1934). Mead and Benedict were two of Boas's students.\nScholars generally agree that Boas developed his ideas under the influence of the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Legend has it that, on a field trip to the Baffin Islands in 1883, Boas would pass the frigid nights reading Kant's \"Critique of Pure Reason\". In that work, Kant argued that human understanding could not be described according to the laws that applied to the operations of nature, and that its operations were therefore free, not determined, and that ideas regulated human action, sometimes independent of material interests. Following Kant, Boas pointed out the starving Eskimos who, because of their religious beliefs, would not hunt seals to feed themselves, thus showing that no pragmatic or material calculus determined their values.\nCauses.\nEthnocentrism is believed to be a learned behavior embedded into a variety of beliefs and values of an individual or group.\nDue to enculturation, individuals in in-groups have a deeper sense of loyalty and are more likely to following the norms and develop relationships with associated members. Within relation to enculturation, ethnocentrism is said to be a transgenerational problem since stereotypes and similar perspectives can be enforced and encouraged as time progresses. Although loyalty can increase better in-grouper approval, limited interactions with other cultures can prevent individuals to have an understanding and appreciation towards cultural differences resulting in greater ethnocentrism.\nThe social identity approach suggests that ethnocentric beliefs are caused by a strong identification with one's own culture that directly creates a positive view of that culture. It is theorized by Henri Tajfel and John C. Turner that to maintain that positive view, people make social comparisons that cast competing cultural groups in an unfavorable light.\nAlternative or opposite perspectives could cause individuals to develop na\u00efve realism and be subject to limitations in understandings. These characteristics can also lead to individuals to become subject to ethnocentrism, when referencing out-groups, and black sheep effect, where personal perspectives contradict those from fellow in-groupers.\nRealistic conflict theory assumes that ethnocentrism happens due to \"real or perceived conflict\" between groups. This also happens when a dominant group may perceive the new members as a threat. Scholars have recently demonstrated that individuals are more likely to develop in-group identification and out-group negatively in response to intergroup competition, conflict, or threat.\nAlthough the causes of ethnocentric beliefs and actions can have varying roots of context and reason, the effects of ethnocentrism has had both negative and positive effects throughout history. The most detrimental effects of ethnocentrism resulting into genocide, apartheid, slavery, and many violent conflicts. Historical examples of these negative effects of ethnocentrism are The Holocaust, the Crusades, the Trail of Tears, and the internment of Japanese Americans. These events were a result of cultural differences reinforced inhumanely by a superior, majority group. In his 1976 book on evolution, \"The Selfish Gene\", evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins writes that \"blood-feuds and inter-clan warfare are easily interpretative in terms of Hamilton's genetic theory.\" Simulation-based experiments in evolutionary game theory have attempted to provide an explanation for the selection of ethnocentric-strategy phenotypes.\nThe positive examples of ethnocentrism throughout history have aimed to prohibit the callousness of ethnocentrism and reverse the perspectives of living in a single culture. These organizations can include the formation of the United Nations; aimed to maintain international relations, and the Olympic Games; a celebration of sports and friendly competition between cultures.\nEffects.\nA study in New Zealand was used to compare how individuals associate with in-groups and out-groupers and has a connotation to discrimination. Strong in-group favoritism benefits the dominant groups and is different from out-group hostility and/or punishment. A suggested solution is to limit the perceived threat from the out-group that also decreases the likeliness for those supporting the in-groups to negatively react.\nEthnocentrism also influences consumer preference over which goods they purchase. A study that used several in-group and out-group orientations have shown a correlation between national identity, consumer cosmopolitanism, consumer ethnocentrism, and the methods consumer choose their products, whether imported or domestic.\nEthnocentrism and racism.\nEthnocentrism is usually associated with racism. However, as mentioned before, ethnocentrism does not necessarily implicate a negative connotation. In European research the term racism is not linked to ethnocentrism because Europeans avoid applying the concept of race to humans; meanwhile, using this term is not a problem for American researchers. Since ethnocentrism implicated a strong identification with one's in-group, it mostly automatically leads to negative feelings and stereotyping to the members of the outgroup, which can be confused with racism. Finally, scholars agree that avoiding stereotypes is an indispensable prerequisite to overcome ethnocentrism; and mass media play a key role regarding this issue.\nEffects of ethnocentrism in the media.\nMass media plays an important role in our current society. We are constantly exposed to media content every day. Researchers had found that ethnocentrism is dysfunctional in communication and similar fields because the lack of acceptance of other cultures leads to the creation of barriers for people of different backgrounds to interact with each other. The presence of ethnocentrism in media content creates an issue in the exchange of messages in the communication process. The media industry is dominated by the Global North, so Western ethnocentrism tends to be exposed in the media. This can be seen in the predominance of Westerner content in TV shows, film, and other forms of mass media. Some Western shows tend to depict foreign cultures as inferior or strange in contrast to their own culture.\nFilm.\nCinema has been around our society since the beginning of the 20th century, and it is an important tool that allow to entertain and/or educate the viewer. Western companies are usually the leaders of the film industry. Thus, it is common to be exposed to content based on Westerners' point of view. Examples of ethnocentrism are constantly seen in films whether intentionally or unintentionally. A clear example of this can be seen on the American animated film Aladdin by Disney in 1992; the opening song of the movie is \"Arabian Nights,\" it is mentioned on the lyrics that that land \"it's barbaric, hey, but it's home,\" which had caused debates among the audience because it could lead to thinking that the Arabic culture is barbaric. Examples like this abound on many Hollywood films. Experts on the field propose that a way of overcoming ethnocentrism is to avoid the use of stereotypes in films. Therefore, the presence of ethnocentrism in cinema leads to stereotypical images of cultures that differ from ours.\nSocial media.\nA considerable number of people are exposed to social media, whose purpose is to encourage interaction among users. However, that exchange of information can be hindered by ethnocentrism because it can diminish the interest of interacting with people from other cultures.\nReferences.\nNotes\nFurther reading"}

{"id": "9830", "revid": "5258665", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9830", "title": "European Convention on Human Rights", "text": " \nThe European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) (formally the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms) is an international convention to protect human rights and political freedoms in Europe. Drafted in 1950 by the then newly formed Council of Europe, the convention entered into force on 3 September 1953. All Council of Europe member states are party to the Convention and new members are expected to ratify the convention at the earliest opportunity.\nThe Convention established the European Court of Human Rights (also referred to by the same initials as the convention, ECHR). Any person who feels their rights have been violated under the Convention by a state party can take a case to the Court. Judgments finding violations are binding on the States concerned and they are obliged to execute them. The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe monitors the execution of judgements, particularly to ensure payment of the amounts awarded by the Court to the applicants in compensation for the damage they have sustained. \nThe Convention has several protocols, which amend the convention framework.\nThe Convention has had a significant influence on the law in Council of Europe member countries and is widely considered the most effective international treaty for human rights protection.\nHistory.\nThe European Convention on Human Rights has played an important role in the development and awareness of human rights in Europe.\nThe development of a regional system of human rights protections operating across Europe can be seen as a direct response to twin concerns. First, in the aftermath of the Second World War, the convention, drawing on the inspiration of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, can be seen as part of a wider response from the Allied powers in delivering a human rights agenda to prevent the most serious human rights violations which had occurred during the Second World War from happening again. Second, the Convention was a response to the growth of Stalinism in Central and Eastern Europe and designed to protect the member states of the Council of Europe from communist subversion. This, in part, explains the constant references to values and principles that are \"necessary in a democratic society\" throughout the Convention, despite the fact that such principles are not in any way defined within the convention itself.\nFrom 7 to 10 May 1948, politicians including Winston Churchill, Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Konrad Adenauer, civil society representatives, academics, business leaders, trade unionists, and religious leaders convened the Congress of Europe in The Hague. At the end of the Congress, a declaration and following pledge to create the Convention was issued. The second and third Articles of the Pledge stated: \"We desire a Charter of Human Rights guaranteeing liberty of thought, assembly and expression as well as right to form a political opposition. We desire a Court of Justice with adequate sanctions for the implementation of this Charter.\"\nThe Convention was drafted by the Council of Europe after the Second World War and Hague Congress. Over 100 parliamentarians from the twelve member states of the Council of Europe gathered in Strasbourg in the summer of 1949 for the first ever meeting of the Council's Consultative Assembly to draft a \"charter of human rights\" and to establish a court to enforce it. British MP and lawyer Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe, the Chair of the Assembly's Committee on Legal and Administrative Questions, was one of its leading members and guided the drafting of the Convention, based on an earlier draft produced by the European Movement. As a prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trials, he had seen first-hand how international justice could be effectively applied. French former minister and Resistance fighter Pierre-Henri Teitgen submitted a report to the Assembly proposing a list of rights to be protected, selecting a number from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that had recently been agreed to in New York, and defining how the enforcing judicial mechanism might operate. After extensive debates, the Assembly sent its final proposal to the Council's Committee of Ministers, which convened a group of experts to draft the Convention itself.\nThe Convention was designed to incorporate a traditional civil liberties approach to securing \"effective political democracy\", from the strongest traditions in the United Kingdom, France and other member states of the fledgling Council of Europe, as said by Guido Raimondi, President of European Court of Human Rights:\nThe Convention was opened for signature on 4 November 1950 in Rome. It was ratified and entered into force on 3 September 1953. It is overseen and enforced by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, and the Council of Europe. Until procedural reforms in the late 1990s, the Convention was also overseen by a European Commission on Human Rights.\nDrafting.\nThe Convention is drafted in broad terms, in a similar (albeit more modern) manner to the 1689 English Bill of Rights, the 1791 U.S. Bill of Rights, the 1789 French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, or the first part of the German Basic law. Statements of principle are, from a legal point of view, not determinative and require extensive interpretation by courts to bring out meaning in particular factual situations.\nConvention articles.\nAs amended by Protocol 11, the Convention consists of three parts. The main rights and freedoms are contained in Section I, which consists of Articles 2 to 18. Section II (Articles 19 to 51) sets up the Court and its rules of operation. Section III contains various concluding provisions.\nBefore the entry into force of Protocol 11, Section II (Article 19) set up the Commission and the Court, Sections III (Articles 20 to 37) and IV (Articles 38 to 59) included the high-level machinery for the operation of, respectively, the Commission and the Court, and Section V contained various concluding provisions.\nMany of the Articles in Section I are structured in two paragraphs: the first sets out a basic right or freedom (such as Article 2(1) \u2013 the right to life) but the second contains various exclusions, exceptions or limitations on the basic right (such as Article 2(2) \u2013 which excepts certain uses of force leading to death).\nArticle 1 \u2013 respecting rights.\nArticle 1 simply binds the signatory parties to secure the rights under the other Articles of the Convention \"within their jurisdiction\". In exceptional cases, \"jurisdiction\" may not be confined to a Contracting State's own national territory; the obligation to secure Convention rights then also extends to foreign territories, such as occupied land in which the State exercises effective control.\nIn \"Loizidou v Turkey\", the European Court of Human Rights ruled that jurisdiction of member states to the convention extended to areas under that state's effective control as a result of military action.\nArticle 2 \u2013 life.\nArticle 2 protects the right of every person to their life. The right to life extends only to human beings, not to non-human animals, or to \"legal persons\" such as corporations. In \"Evans v United Kingdom\", the Court ruled that the question of whether the right to life extends to a human embryo fell within a state's margin of appreciation. In \"Vo v France\", the Court declined to extend the right to life to an unborn child, while stating that \"it is neither desirable, nor even possible as matters stand, to answer in the abstract the question whether the unborn child is a person for the purposes of Article 2 of the Convention\".\nThe Court has ruled that states have three main duties under Article 2:\nThe first paragraph of the article contains an exception for lawful executions, although this exception has largely been superseded by Protocols 6 and 13. Protocol 6 prohibits the imposition of the death penalty in peacetime, while Protocol 13 extends the prohibition to all circumstances. (For more on Protocols 6 and 13, see below).\nThe second paragraph of Article 2 provides that death resulting from defending oneself or others, arresting a suspect or fugitive, or suppressing riots or insurrections, will not contravene the Article when the use of force involved is \"no more than absolutely necessary\".\nSignatory states to the Convention can only derogate from the rights contained in Article 2 for deaths which result from lawful acts of war.\nThe European Court of Human Rights did not rule upon the right to life until 1995, when in \"McCann and Others v United Kingdom\" it ruled that the exception contained in the second paragraph does not constitute situations when it is permitted to kill, but situations where it is permitted to use force which might result in the deprivation of life.\nArticle 3 \u2013 torture.\nArticle 3 prohibits torture and \"inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\". There are no exceptions or limitations on this right. This provision usually applies, apart from torture, to cases of severe police violence and poor conditions in detention.\nThe Court has emphasized the fundamental nature of Article 3 in holding that the prohibition is made in \"absolute terms\u00a0... irrespective of a victim's conduct\". The Court has also held that states cannot deport or extradite individuals who might be subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, in the recipient state.\nThe first case to examine Article 3 was the Greek case, which set an influential precedent. In \"Ireland v. United Kingdom\" (1979\u20131980) the Court ruled that the five techniques developed by the United Kingdom (wall-standing, hooding, subjection to noise, deprivation of sleep, and deprivation of food and drink), as used against fourteen detainees in Northern Ireland by the United Kingdom were \"inhuman and degrading\" and breached the European Convention on Human Rights, but did not amount to \"torture\".\nIn \"Aksoy v. Turkey\" (1997) the Court found Turkey guilty of torture in 1996 in the case of a detainee who was suspended by his arms while his hands were tied behind his back.\n\"Selmouni v. France\" (2000) the Court has appeared to be more open to finding states guilty of torture ruling that since the Convention is a \"living instrument\", treatment which it had previously characterized as inhuman or degrading treatment might in future be regarded as torture.\nIn 2014, after new information was uncovered that showed the decision to use the five techniques in Northern Ireland in 1971\u20131972 had been taken by British ministers, the Irish Government asked the European Court of Human Rights to review its judgement. In 2018, by six votes to one, the Court declined.\nArticle 4 \u2013 servitude.\nArticle 4 prohibits slavery, servitude and forced labour but exempts labour:\nArticle 5 \u2013 liberty and security.\nArticle 5 provides that everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. Liberty and security of the person are taken as a \"compound\" concept \u2013 security of the person has not been subject to separate interpretation by the Court.\nArticle 5 provides the right to liberty, subject only to lawful arrest or detention under certain other circumstances, such as arrest on reasonable suspicion of a crime or imprisonment in fulfilment of a sentence. The article also provides those arrested with the right to be informed, in a language they understand, of the reasons for the arrest and any charge they face, the right of prompt access to judicial proceedings to determine the legality of the arrest or detention, to trial within a reasonable time or release pending trial, and the right to compensation in the case of arrest or detention in violation of this article.\nArticle 6 \u2013 fair trial.\nArticle 6 provides a detailed right to a fair trial, including the right to a public hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal within reasonable time, the presumption of innocence, and other minimum rights for those charged with a criminal offence (adequate time and facilities to prepare their defence, access to legal representation, right to examine witnesses against them or have them examined, right to the free assistance of an interpreter).\nThe majority of convention violations that the court finds today are excessive delays, in violation of the \"reasonable time\" requirement, in civil and criminal proceedings before national courts, mostly in Italy and France. Under the \"independent tribunal\" requirement, the court has ruled that military judges in Turkish state security courts are incompatible with Article 6. In compliance with this Article, Turkey has now adopted a law abolishing these courts.\nAnother significant set of violations concerns the \"confrontation clause\" of Article 6 (i.e. the right to examine witnesses or have them examined). In this respect, problems of compliance with Article 6 may arise when national laws allow the use in evidence of the testimonies of absent, anonymous and vulnerable witnesses.\nArticle 7 \u2013 retroactivity.\nArticle 7 prohibits the retroactive criminalisation of acts and omissions. No person may be punished for an act that was not a criminal offence at the time of its commission. The article states that a criminal offence is one under either national or international law, which would permit a party to prosecute someone for a crime which was not illegal under domestic law at the time, so long as it was prohibited by international law. The Article also prohibits a heavier penalty being imposed than was applicable at the time when the criminal act was committed.\nArticle 7 incorporates the legal principle \"nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege\" into the convention.\nRelevant cases are: \nArticle 8 \u2013 privacy.\nArticle 8 provides a right to respect for one's \"private and family life, his home and his correspondence\", subject to certain restrictions that are \"in accordance with law\" and \"necessary in a democratic society\". This article clearly provides a right to be free of unlawful searches, but the Court has given the protection for \"private and family life\" that this article provides a broad interpretation, taking for instance that prohibition of private consensual homosexual acts violates this article. There have been cases discussing consensual familial sexual relationships, and how the criminalisation of this may violate this article. However, the ECHR still allows such familial sexual acts to be criminal. This may be compared to the jurisprudence of the United States Supreme Court, which has also adopted a somewhat broad interpretation of the right to privacy. Furthermore, Article\u00a08 sometimes comprises positive obligations: whereas classical human rights are formulated as prohibiting a State from interfering with rights, and thus \"not\" to do something (e.g. not to separate a family under family life protection), the effective enjoyment of such rights may also include an obligation for the State to become active, and to \"do\" something (e.g. to enforce access for a divorced parent to his/her child).\nNotable cases:\nArticle 9 \u2013 conscience and religion.\nArticle 9 provides a right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. This includes the freedom to change a religion or belief, and to manifest a religion or belief in worship, teaching, practice and observance, subject to certain restrictions that are \"in accordance with law\" and \"necessary in a democratic society\".\nRelevant cases are: \nArticle 10 \u2013 expression.\nArticle 10 provides the right to freedom of expression, subject to certain restrictions that are \"in accordance with law\" and \"necessary in a democratic society\". This right includes the freedom to hold opinions, and to receive and impart information and ideas, but allows restrictions for:\nRelevant cases are:\nArticle 11 \u2013 association.\nArticle 11 protects the right to freedom of assembly and association, including the right to form trade unions, subject to certain restrictions that are \"in accordance with law\" and \"necessary in a democratic society\".\nArticle 12 \u2013 marriage.\nArticle 12 provides a right for women and men of marriageable age to marry and establish a family.\nDespite a number of invitations, the Court has so far refused to apply the protections of this article to same-sex marriage. The Court has defended this on the grounds that the article was intended to apply only to different-sex marriage, and that a wide margin of appreciation must be granted to parties in this area.\nIn \"Goodwin v United Kingdom\" the Court ruled that a law which still classified post-operative transsexual persons under their pre-operative sex violated article 12 as it meant that transsexual persons were unable to marry individuals of their post-operative opposite sex. This reversed an earlier ruling in \"Rees v United Kingdom\". This did not, however, alter the Court's understanding that Article 12 protects only different-sex couples.\nThe European Court of Human Rights ruled in \"Schalk and Kopf v Austria\" that countries are not required to provide marriage licenses for same-sex couples; however, if a country allows same-sex couple marriage it must be done under the same conditions that opposite-sex couples marriage face, in order to prevent a breach of article 14 \u2013 the prohibition of discrimination. Additionally, the court ruled in the 2015 case of \"Oliari and Others v Italy\" that states have a positive obligation to ensure there is a specific legal framework for the recognition and protection of same-sex couples.\nArticle 13 \u2013 effective remedy.\nArticle 13 provides for the right for an effective remedy before national authorities for violations of rights under the Convention. The inability to obtain a remedy before a national court for an infringement of a Convention right is thus a free-standing and separately actionable infringement of the Convention.\nArticle 14 \u2013 discrimination.\nArticle 14 contains a prohibition of discrimination. This prohibition is broad in some ways and narrow in others. It is broad in that it prohibits discrimination under a potentially unlimited number of grounds. While the article specifically prohibits discrimination based on \"sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinions, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status\", the last of these allows the court to extend to Article 14 protection to other grounds not specifically mentioned such as has been done regarding discrimination based on a person's sexual orientation.\nAt the same time, the article's protection is limited in that it only prohibits discrimination with respect to rights under the Convention. Thus, an applicant must prove discrimination in the enjoyment of a specific right that is guaranteed elsewhere in the Convention (e.g. discrimination based on sex \u2013 Article 14 \u2013 in the enjoyment of the right to freedom of expression \u2013 Article 10). It has been said that laws regarding familial sexual relationships (or incest) are in breach of Article 14 when combined with Article 8.\nProtocol 12 extends this prohibition to cover discrimination in any legal right, even when that legal right is not protected under the Convention, so long as it is provided for in national law.\nArticle 15 \u2013 derogations.\nArticle 15 allows contracting states to derogate from certain rights guaranteed by the Convention in a time of \"war or other public emergency threatening the life of the nation\". Permissible derogations under article 15 must meet three substantive conditions:\nIn addition to these substantive requirements, the derogation must be procedurally sound. There must be some formal announcement of the derogation and notice of the derogation and any measures adopted under it, and the ending of the derogation must be communicated to the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe.\nAs of 2016, eight member states had ever invoked derogations. The Court is quite permissive in accepting a state's derogations from the Convention but applies a higher degree of scrutiny in deciding whether measures taken by states under a derogation are, in the words of Article 15, \"strictly required by the exigencies of the situation\". Thus in \"A\u00a0v\u00a0United Kingdom\", the Court dismissed a claim that a derogation lodged by the British government in response to the September 11 attacks was invalid, but went on to find that measures taken by the United Kingdom under that derogation were disproportionate.\nExamples of such derogations include:\nArticle 16 \u2013 foreign parties.\nArticle 16 allows states to restrict the political activity of foreigners. The Court has ruled that European Union member states cannot consider the nationals of other member states to be aliens.\nArticle 17 \u2013 abuse of rights.\nArticle 17 provides that no one may use the rights guaranteed by the Convention to seek the abolition or limitation of rights guaranteed in the Convention. This addresses instances where states seek to restrict a human right in the name of another human right, or where individuals rely on a human right to undermine other human rights (for example where an individual issues a death threat).\nArticle 18 \u2013 permitted restrictions.\nArticle 18 provides that any limitations on the rights provided for in the Convention may be used only for the purpose for which they are provided. For example, Article 5, which guarantees the right to personal freedom, may be explicitly limited in order to bring a suspect before a judge. To use pre-trial detention as a means of intimidation of a person under a false pretext is, therefore, a limitation of right (to freedom) which does not serve an explicitly provided purpose (to be brought before a judge), and is therefore contrary to Article 18.\nConvention protocols.\n, fifteen protocols to the Convention have been opened for signature. These can be divided into two main groups: those amending the framework of the convention system, and those expanding the rights that can be protected. The former require unanimous ratification by member states before coming into force, while the latter require a certain number of states to sign before coming into force.\nProtocol 1.\nThis Protocol contains three different rights which the signatories could not agree to place in the Convention itself. Monaco and Switzerland have signed but never ratified Protocol 1.\nArticle 1 \u2013 property.\nArticle 1 (\"A1P1\") provides that \"every natural or legal person is entitled to the peaceful enjoyment of his possessions\". The European Court of Human Rights acknowledged a violation of the fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual's fundamental rights, also, in the uncertainty \u2013 for the owner \u2013 about the future of the property, and in the absence of an allowance.\nArticle 2 \u2013 education.\nArticle 2 provides for the right not to be denied an education and the right for parents to have their children educated in accordance with their religious and other views. It does not however guarantee any particular level of education of any particular quality.\nAlthough phrased in the Protocol as a negative right, in \"\u015eahin v. Turkey\" the Court ruled that:\nArticle 3 \u2013 elections.\nArticle 3 provides for the right to elections performed by secret ballot, that are also free and that occur at regular intervals.\nProtocol 4 \u2013 civil imprisonment, free movement, expulsion.\nArticle 1 prohibits the imprisonment of people for inability to fulfil a contract. Article 2 provides for a right to freely move within a country once lawfully there and for a right to leave any country. Article 3 prohibits the expulsion of nationals and provides for the right of an individual to enter a country of their nationality. Article 4 prohibits the collective expulsion of foreigners.\nTurkey and the United Kingdom have signed but never ratified Protocol 4. Greece and Switzerland have neither signed nor ratified this protocol.\nThe United Kingdom's failure to ratify this protocol is due to concerns over the interaction of Article 2 and Article 3 with British nationality law. Specifically, several classes of \"British national\" (such as British National (Overseas)) do not have the right of abode in the United Kingdom and are subject to immigration control there. In 2009, the UK government stated that it had no plans to ratify Protocol 4 because of concerns that those articles could be taken as conferring that right.\nProtocol 6 \u2013 restriction of death penalty.\nRequires parties to restrict the application of the death penalty to times of war or \"imminent threat of war\".\nEvery Council of Europe member state has signed and ratified Protocol 6, except Russia, which has signed but not ratified.\nProtocol 7 \u2013 crime and family.\nDespite having signed the protocol more than thirty years ago Germany and the Netherlands have never ratified it. Turkey, which signed the protocol in 1985, ratified it in 2016, becoming the latest member state to do so. The United Kingdom has neither signed nor ratified the protocol.\nProtocol 12 \u2013 discrimination.\nApplies the current expansive and indefinite grounds of prohibited discrimination in Article 14 to the exercise of any legal right and to the actions (including the obligations) of public authorities.\nThe Protocol entered into force on 1 April 2005 and has () been ratified by 20 member states. Several member states\u2014Bulgaria, Denmark, France, Lithuania, Monaco, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom\u2014have not signed the protocol.\nThe United Kingdom government has declined to sign Protocol 12 on the basis that they believe the wording of protocol is too wide and would result in a flood of new cases testing the extent of the new provision. They believe that the phrase \"rights set forth by law\" might include international conventions to which the UK is not a party, and would result in incorporation of these instruments by stealth. It has been suggested that the protocol is therefore in a catch-22, since the UK will decline to either sign or ratify the protocol until the European Court of Human Rights has addressed the meaning of the provision, while the court is hindered in doing so by the lack of applications to the court concerning the protocol caused by the decisions of Europe's most populous states\u2014including the UK\u2014not to ratify the protocol. The UK government, nevertheless, stated in 2004 that it \"agrees in principle that the ECHR should contain a provision against discrimination that is free-standing and not parasitic on the other Convention rights\". The first judgment that found a violation of Protocol No. 12, \"Sejdi\u0107 and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina\", was delivered in 2009.\nProtocol 13 \u2013 complete abolition of death penalty.\nProtocol 13 provides for the total abolition of the death penalty. Currently all Council of Europe member states but three have ratified Protocol 13. Armenia has signed but not ratified the protocol. Russia and Azerbaijan have not signed it.\nProcedural and institutional protocols.\nThe Convention's provisions affecting institutional and procedural matters have been altered several times by means of protocols. These amendments have, with the exception of Protocol 2, amended the text of the convention. Protocol 2 did not amend the text of the convention as such but stipulated that it was to be treated as an integral part of the text. All of these protocols have required the unanimous ratification of all the member states of the Council of Europe to enter into force.\nProtocol 11.\nProtocols 2, 3, 5, 8, 9 and 10 have now been superseded by Protocol 11 which entered into force on 1 November 1998. It established a fundamental change in the machinery of the convention. It abolished the Commission, allowing individuals to apply directly to the Court, which was given compulsory jurisdiction and altered the latter's structure. Previously states could ratify the Convention without accepting the jurisdiction of the Court of Human Rights. The protocol also abolished the judicial functions of the Committee of Ministers.\nProtocol 14.\nProtocol 14 follows on from Protocol 11 in proposing to further improve the efficiency of the Court. It seeks to \"filter\" out cases that have less chance of succeeding along with those that are broadly similar to cases brought previously against the same member state. Furthermore, a case will not be considered admissible where an applicant has not suffered a \"significant disadvantage\". This latter ground can only be used when an examination of the application on the merits is not considered necessary and where the subject-matter of the application had already been considered by a national court.\nA new mechanism was introduced by Protocol 14 to assist enforcement of judgements by the Committee of Ministers. The Committee can ask the Court for an interpretation of a judgement and can even bring a member state before the Court for non-compliance of a previous judgement against that state. Protocol 14 also allows for European Union accession to the Convention. The protocol has been ratified by every Council of Europe member state, Russia being last in February 2010. It entered into force on 1 June 2010.\nA provisional Protocol 14bis had been opened for signature in 2009. Pending the ratification of Protocol 14 itself, 14bis was devised to allow the Court to implement revised procedures in respect of the states which have ratified it. It allowed single judges to reject manifestly inadmissible applications made against the states that have ratified the protocol. It also extended the competence of three-judge chambers to declare applications made against those states admissible and to decide on their merits where there already is a well-established case law of the Court. Now that all Council of Europe member states have ratified Protocol 14, Protocol 14bis has lost its \"raison d'\u00eatre\" and according to its own terms ceased to have any effect when Protocol 14 entered into force on 1 June 2010."}

{"id": "9833", "revid": "40370053", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9833", "title": "Eureka Rebellion", "text": "The Eureka Rebellion occurred in 1854, instigated by gold miners in Ballarat, Victoria, Australia, who revolted against the colonial authority of the United Kingdom. It culminated in the Battle of the Eureka Stockade, which was fought between rebels and the colonial forces of Australia on 3 December 1854 at Eureka Lead and named after a stockade structure built by miners in the lead-up to the conflict. The rebellion resulted in at least 27 deaths and many injuries, the majority of casualties being rebels.\nThe rebellion was the culmination of a period of civil disobedience during the Victorian gold rush with miners objecting to the expense of a miner's licence, taxation via the licence without representation, and the actions of the government, the police and military. The local rebellion grew from a Ballarat Reform League movement and culminated in the erection by the rebels of a crude battlement and a swift and deadly siege by colonial forces.\nWhen the captured rebels faced trial in Melbourne, mass public support led to their release and resulted in the introduction of the Electoral Act 1856, which mandated suffrage for male colonists in the lower house in the Victorian parliament. This is considered the second instituted act of political democracy in Australia. The Eureka Rebellion is controversially identified with the birth of democracy in Australia and interpreted by many as a political revolt. A dedicated museum in Ballarat, the Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka, houses a flag which the miners designed and swore allegiance to before the battle. Known at the time as the \"Australian flag\", it has become a national symbol, and is sometimes a candidate in debates about changing the Australian flag.\nLocation.\nIn 2015, a report commissioned by the City of Ballarat found that the most likely site of the rallies which led to the rebellion was 29 St. Paul's Way, Bakery Hill. Given documentary evidence and its elevation, this was likely to be the site where speeches were made and the Eureka Flag was symbolically hoisted for the first time. As of 2018, the area is a carpark awaiting residential development. \nThe precise site of the Stockade itself remains unknown, but William Bramwell Withers described its location in 1870:\n'It was an area of about an acre, rudely enclosed with slabs, and situated at the point where the Eureka Lead took its bend by the old Melbourne road, now called Eureka Street ... The Site ... lay about midway between what are now Stawell and Queen streets on the east and west, and close to Eureka Street on the south.'\nBackground.\nProtests on the Goldfields: 1851\u20131854.\nHiscock's gold rush began on 12 August 1851 following the publication in the \"Geelong Advertiser\" of Thomas Hiscock's gold findings at Hiscock's, 3 kilometres west of Buninyong (now Magpie, approximately 10 kilometres south of Eureka). Just days later on 16 August 1851, Lieutenant-Governor Latrobe proclaimed in the Government Gazette crown rights for all mining proceeds and a licence fee of 30 shillings per month effective from 1 September 1851.\nOn 26 August, a rally of 40\u201350 miners opposing the fee was held at Hiscock's gully \u2013 the first of many such protests in the colony. The miners opposed government policies of oppression including the licence fee, and put forward four resolutions to this effect. This first meeting was followed by dissent across the colony's mining settlements.\nIn December the government announced that it intended to triple the licence fee from \u00a31 to \u00a33 a month, from 1 January 1852. This move incited protests around the colony, including the Forest Creek Monster Meeting of December 1851. In Ballarat, as historian Weston Bate noted, diggers became so agitated that they began to gather arms. The government hastily repealed its plans due to the reaction.\nNevertheless, the oppressive licence hunts continued and increased in frequency causing general dissent among the diggers. In addition, Weston Bate noted that the Ballarat diggings were in strong opposition to the strict liquor licensing laws imposed by the government.\nChanges to the Goldfields Act in 1853 allowed licence searches to occur at any time which further incensed the diggers. In Bendigo in 1853, an Anti-Gold Licence Association was formed and the miners were apparently on the brink of an armed clash with authorities. Again in 1854, Bendigo miners responded to an increase in the frequency of twice weekly licence hunts with threats of armed rebellion.\nMurder of James Scobie and the burning of Bentley's Hotel.\nOn 7 October 1854, Scottish miner James Scobie was murdered at Bentley's Eureka Hotel. Ten days later, on 17 October 1854, between 1,000 and 10,000 miners gathered at the hotel to protest the acquittal of James Bentley, the hotel proprietor and prime suspect in Scobie's murder, by an allegedly corrupt magistrate.\nThe miners rioted and Bentley and his wife Catherine fled for their lives as the hotel was burnt down by the angry mob. A small group of soldiers were unable to suppress the riot.\nFurther unrest.\nOn 22 October 1854, Ballarat Catholics met to protest the treatment of Father Smyth.\nThe next day, the arrests of miners McIntyre and Fletcher for the Eureka Hotel fire provoked a mass meeting which attracted 4000 miners. The meeting resolved to establish a 'Digger's Rights Society', to protect their rights. On 1 November 1854, 10,000 miners met once again at Bakery Hill. They were addressed by Thomas Kennedy, Henry Holyoake, George Black and Henry Ross. The diggers were further angered by the arrest of another seven of their number for the Eureka Hotel fire.\nBallarat Reform League.\nOn Saturday, 11 November 1854 a crowd estimated at more than 10,000 miners gathered at Bakery Hill, directly opposite the government encampment. At this meeting, the Ballarat Reform League was created, under the chairmanship of Chartist John Basson Humffray. Several other Reform League leaders, including Kennedy and Holyoake, had been involved with the Chartist movement in England. Many of the miners had past involvement in the Chartist movement and the social upheavals in Britain, Ireland, and continental Europe during the 1840s.\nIn setting its goals, the Ballarat Reform League used the first five of the British Chartist movement's principles as set out in the People's Charter of 1838. They did not adopt or agitate for the Chartist's sixth principle, secret ballots. The meeting passed a resolution \"that it is the inalienable right of every citizen to have a voice in making the laws he is called on to obey, that taxation without representation is tyranny.\" The meeting also resolved to secede from the United Kingdom if the situation did not improve.\nThroughout the following weeks, the League sought to negotiate with Commissioner Robert Rede and the Governor of Victoria, Sir Charles Hotham, on the specific matters relating to Bentley and the death of Scobie, the men being tried for the burning of the Eureka Hotel, the broader issues of abolition of the licence, suffrage and democratic representation of the gold fields, and disbanding of the Gold Commission. On 16 November 1854 Governor Hotham appointed a Royal Commission to address the gold miners' problems and grievances. However, Commissioner Rede, rather than hear miners' grievances, increased the police presence in the gold fields and summoned reinforcements from Melbourne. Many historians (most notably Manning Clark) attribute this to his belief in his right to exert authority over the \"rabble.\"\nOn 28 November 1854, the reinforcements marching from Melbourne were attacked by a crowd of miners. A number were injured. A rumour of the death of a drummer boy began, and there was even a memorial erected to him in Ballarat Cemetery for many years, although historical research has shown that the boy, John Egan, continued military service until dying in 1860.\nAt a meeting of about 12,000 'diggers' on the following day, (29 November), the Reform League delegation relayed its failure to achieve any success in negotiations with the authorities. The miners resolved on open resistance to the authorities and to burn the hated licences. Local clergyman Theophilus Taylor recorded his impressions. \nRede responded by ordering police to conduct a licence search on 30 November. Eight defaulters were arrested, and most of the military resources available had to be summoned to extricate the arresting officers from the angry mob that had assembled.\nClergyman Taylor's account identified the rising tension. \nThis raid prompted a change in the leadership of the Reform League, to people who argued in favour of 'physical force' rather than the 'moral force' championed by Humffray and the old leadership.\nBattle of the Eureka Stockade.\nParamilitary mobilisation and swearing allegiance to the Southern Cross.\nIn the rising tide of anger and resentment amongst the miners, a more militant leader, Peter Lalor, was elected. In swift fashion, a military structure was assembled. Brigades were formed, and captains were appointed. Licences were burnt, and on 1 December at Bakery Hill, \"The disaffected miners... held a meeting where at the Australian flag of independence was solemnly consecrated and vows proffered for its defence.\", with the 'Eureka oath' being sworn by Peter Lalor to the affirmation of his fellow demonstrators, who encamped themselves around the flag to resist further licence hunts and harassment by the authorities: \"We swear by the Southern Cross to stand truly by each other and fight to defend our rights and liberties.\"\nThe white and blue Eureka Flag, said to be designed by a Canadian miner, Captain Henry Ross, and bearing nothing but the Southern Cross, was then flown for the first (recorded) occasion; according to \"The Ballarat Times\", which first mentioned the flag a week earlier on 24 November 1854, at \"about eleven o'clock the 'Southern Cross' was hoisted, and its maiden appearance was a fascinating object to behold.\" The flag was believed to have been sewn by Anastasia Hayes. Reportedly influenced by earlier designs such as the Australian Federation Flag, as a gesture of defiance , it deliberately excluded the British Union Flag, which is included in the official flag of Australia. The Eureka flag was commonly referred to at the time as the Australian flag, and as the Southern Cross, with \"The Age\" variously reporting, on 28 November: \"The Australian flag shall triumphantly wave in the sunshine of its own blue and peerless sky, over thousands of Australia's adopted sons\"; the day after the battle: \"They assembled round the Australian flag, which has now a permanent flag-staff\"; and during the 1855 Eureka trials, that it was sworn that the Eureka flag was also known as the \"digger's flag\" and also as \"the Southern Cross\".\n\"Remember Vinegar Hill\": Irish dimension factors in dwindling numbers at stockade.\n\"The Argus\" newspaper of 4 December 1854 reported that the Union Jack \"had\" to be hoisted underneath the Eureka flag at the stockade, and that both flags were by then in the possession of the foot police.\nSome have questioned whether this sole contemporaneous report of the otherwise unaccounted for Union Jack being present is accurate. In defence of this alternative scenario it has been stressed that the investigating journalist may have had available eyewitness reports of the two flags having been seized, and that it was possibly an 11th hour response to the divided loyalties among the heterogeneous rebel force which was in the process of melting away (at one stage 1,500 of 17,280 men in Ballarat were present, with only 150 taking part in the battle), with Lalor's choice of password for the night of 2 December \u2013 \"Vinegar Hill\" \u2013 causing support for the rebellion to fall away among those who were otherwise disposed to resist the military, as word spread that the question of Irish home rule had become involved.\nGregory Black, military historian and author of \"Eureka Stockade: A Ferocious and Bloody Battle\", concedes two flags may have been flown on the day of the battle, as the miners were claiming to be defending their British rights, with a further article in \"The Argus\" on 9 December 1854, reporting that Constable Hugh King had found a Union Jack like flag being carried by a prisoner; and, according to \"The Eureka Encyclopedia\", Sergeant John McNeil at the time shredded a flag at the Spencer Street Barracks in Melbourne, which was said to be the Eureka flag, but which may well have been a Union Jack.\nIt is certain that Irish-born people were strongly represented at the Eureka Stockade. Eureka historians have discovered that as well as comprising most of the miners inside the stockade at the finish, the area where the defensive position was established was overwhelmingly populated by the Irish to begin with. Professor Geoffrey Blainey has advanced the view, that the white cross behind the stars on the Eureka flag \"really [is] an Irish cross rather than being [a] configuration of the Southern Cross\".\nDeparting detachment of Independent Californian Rangers leaves small garrison behind.\nDuring 2 December, the peak rebel force trained in and around the stockade. A further two hundred Americans, the Independent Californian Rangers, under the leadership of James McGill, arrived about 4pm. The Americans were armed with revolvers and Mexican knives and possessed horses. In a fateful decision, McGill decided to take most of the Californian Rangers away from the stockade to intercept rumoured British reinforcements coming from Melbourne. Rede's spies observed these actions. That night many of the miners went back to their own tents after the traditional Saturday night carousing, with the assumption that the Queen's military forces would not be sent to attack on the Sabbath (Sunday). A small contingent of miners remained at the stockade overnight, which the spies reported to Rede.\nStockade.\nThe stockade itself was a ramshackle affair which was hastily constructed over the following days from timber and overturned carts. The structure was never meant to be a military stockade or fortress. In the words of Lalor: \"it was nothing more than an enclosure to keep our own men together, and was never erected with an eye to military defence\". Lalor had already outlined a plan whereby, \"if the government forces come to attack us, we should meet them on the Gravel Pits, and if compelled, we should retreat by the heights to the old Canadian Gully, and there we shall make our final stand\".\nSiege of the Eureka Stockade.\nBy the beginning of December, the police contingent at Ballarat had been joined and surpassed in number by soldiers from British Army garrisons in Victoria, including detachments from the 12th (East Suffolk) Regiment of Foot and 40th (2nd Somersetshire) Regiment of Foot.\nAt 3\u00a0am on Sunday, 3 December, a party of 276 soldiers and police, under the command of Captain John W. Thomas approached the Eureka Stockade and a battle ensued.\nThere is no agreement as to which side fired first, but the battle was fierce, brief, and terribly one-sided. The ramshackle army of miners was hopelessly outclassed by a military regiment and was routed in about 10 minutes. Theophilus Taylor's account is succinct. \"A company of troopers &amp; military carried the war into the enemies camp. In a very short time numbers were shot and hundreds taken prisoner\".\nDuring the height of the battle, Lalor was shot in his left arm, took refuge under some timber and was smuggled out of the stockade and hidden. His arm was later amputated.\nStories tell how women ran forward and threw themselves over the injured to prevent further indiscriminate killing. The Commission of Inquiry would later say that it was \"a needless as well as a ruthless sacrifice of human life indiscriminate of innocent or guilty, and after all resistance had disappeared.\"\nEarly in the battle \"Captain\" Henry Ross was shot dead.\nAccording to Lalor's report, fourteen miners (mostly Irish) died inside the stockade and an additional eight died later from injuries they sustained. A further dozen were wounded but recovered. Three months after the Eureka Stockade, Peter Lalor wrote: \"As the inhuman brutalities practised by the troops are so well known, it is unnecessary for me to repeat them. There were 34 digger casualties of which 22 died. The unusual proportion of the killed to the wounded, is owing to the butchery of the military and troopers after the surrender.\"\nDuring the battle, trooper John King the police constable, took down the Eureka flag. By 8\u00a0am, Captain Charles Pasley, the second in command of the British forces, sickened by the carnage, saved a group of prisoners from being bayoneted and threatened to shoot any police or soldiers who continued with the slaughter. Pasley's valuable assistance was acknowledged in despatches printed and laid before the Victorian Legislative Council.\nOne hundred and fourteen diggers, some wounded, were marched off to the Government camp about two kilometres away, where they were kept in an overcrowded lock-up, before being moved to a more spacious barn on Monday morning.\nMartial law was declared throughout the camp on Monday, with no lights allowed in any tent after 8 o'clock pm. It was around this time an outbreak of gunfire reportedly occurred within the camp. Unrelated first-hand accounts state that variously, a woman, her infant child and several men were killed or wounded in an episode of indiscriminate shooting.\nEstimates of the death toll.\nOf the soldiers and police, six were killed, including Captain Wise. News of the battle spread quickly to Melbourne and other gold field regions, turning a perceived Government military victory in repressing a minor insurrection into a public relations disaster. Thousands of people in Melbourne turned out to condemn the authorities, in defiance of their mayor and some Legislative Councillors, who tried to rally support for the government. In Ballarat, only one man responded to the call for special constables, although in Melbourne 1500 were sworn in and armed with batons. Many people voiced their support for the diggers' requested reforms.\nExact numbers of deaths and injuries and persons are difficult to determine as many miners \"fled to the surrounding bush and it is likely a good many more died a lonely death or suffered the agony of their wounds, hidden from the authorities for fear of repercussions.\" according to Eureka researcher and author Dr Dorothy Wickham. The official register of deaths in the Ballarat District Register shows 27 names associated with the stockade battle at Eureka.\nReverend Taylor, in his account, estimated initially 100 deaths but reconsidered writing: \nHistorian Clare Wright quotes one source, Thomas Pierson, who noted in the margin to his diary \"time has proved that near 60 have died of the diggers in all\". According to Wright, Captain Thomas estimated that 30 diggers died on the spot and \"many more died of their wounds subsequently.\" Even the \"Geelong Advertiser\" on 8 December 1854 stated that deaths were \"more numerous than originally supposed\".\nWhile it has been thought all the deaths at Eureka were men, research by historian Clare Wright details that at least one woman lost her life in the massacre. Wright's research details the important role of women on the goldfields and in the reform movement. Her book \"Forgotten Rebels of Eureka\" details how Charles Evans' diary describes a funeral for a woman who was mercilessly butchered by a mounted trooper while pleading for the life of her husband during the Eureka massacre. Her name and the fate and identity of her husband remain unknown.\nAftermath.\nHistorian Geoffrey Blainey has commented, \"Every government in the world would probably have counter-attacked in the face of the building of the stockade.\" For a few weeks it appeared that the status quo had been restored, and Rede ruled the camps with an iron fist.\nReverend Theophilus Taylor's observations were:\nHis note about a 'reign of terror' proved unjustified. Sir Robert Nickle was a wise, considered and even-handed military commander who calmed the tensions. Miner and diarist Charles Evans recorded the effect of his conduct as follows:\nOn 7 December Theophilus Taylor met with Nickle and \"found him to be a very affable and kind gentleman\".\nTrials for sedition and high treason.\nThe first trial relating to the rebellion was a charge of sedition against Henry Seekamp of the \"Ballarat Times\". Seekamp was arrested in his newspaper office on 4 December 1854, for a series of articles that appeared in the \"Ballarat Times\". Many of these articles were written by George Lang, the son of the prominent republican and Presbyterian Minister of Sydney, the Reverend John Dunmore Lang. He was tried and convicted of seditious libel by a Melbourne jury on 23 January 1855 and, after a series of appeals, sentenced to six months imprisonment on 23 March. He was released from prison on 28 June 1855, precisely three months early. While he was in jail, Henry Seekamp's de facto wife, Clara Seekamp took over the business, and became the first female editor of an Australian newspaper.\nOf the approximately 120 'diggers' detained after the rebellion, thirteen were brought to trial. They were:\nThe first trial started on 22 February 1855, with defendants being brought before the court on charges of high treason. Joseph was one of three Americans arrested at the stockade, with the United States Consul intervening for the release of the other two Americans. The prosecution was handled by Attorney-General William Stawell representing the Crown before Chief Justice William \u00e0 Beckett. The jury deliberated for about half an hour before returning a verdict of \"not guilty\". \"A sudden burst of applause arose in the court\" reported \"The Argus\", but was instantly checked by court officers. The Chief Justice condemned this as an attempt to influence the jury, as it could be construed that a jury could be encouraged to deliver a verdict that would receive such applause; he sentenced two men (identified by the Crown Solicitor as having applauded) to a week in prison for contempt. Over 10,000 people had come to hear the jury's verdict. John Joseph was carried around the streets of Melbourne in a chair in triumph, according to the Ballarat newspaper \"The Star\".\nUnder the auspices of Victorian Chief Justice Redmond Barry, all the other 13 accused men were rapidly acquitted to great public acclaim. The trials have on several occasions been called a farce. Rede himself was quietly removed from the camps and reassigned to an insignificant position in rural Victoria.\nCommission of Enquiry.\nWhen Hotham's Royal Commission report, initiated before the conflict, was finally handed down it was scathing in its assessment of all aspects of the administration of the gold fields, and particularly the Eureka Stockade affair. According to Blainey, \"It was perhaps the most generous concession offered by a governor to a major opponent in the history of Australia up to that time. The members of the commission were appointed before Eureka...they were men who were likely to be sympathetic to the diggers.\"\nThe report made several major recommendations, one of which was to restrict Chinese immigration. Its recommendations were only put into effect after the Stockade. The gold licences were then abolished, and replaced by an annual miner's right and an export fee based on the value of the gold. Mining wardens replaced the gold commissioners, and police numbers were cut drastically. The Legislative Council was expanded to allow representation to the major goldfields. Peter Lalor and John Basson Humffray were elected for Ballarat, although there were property qualifications with regards to eligibility to vote in upper house elections in Victoria until the 1950s. After 12 months, all but one of the demands of the Ballarat Reform League had been granted. Lalor and Humffray both enjoyed distinguished careers as politicians, with Lalor later elected as Speaker of the Legislative Assembly of Victoria.\nPeter Lalor.\nFollowing the battle, rebel leader, Irish Australian Peter Lalor, wrote in a statement to the colonists of Victoria, \"There are two things connected with the late outbreak (Eureka) which I deeply regret. The first is, that we shouldn't have been forced to take up arms at all; and the second is, that when we were compelled to take the field in our own defence, we were unable (through want of arms, ammunition and a little organisation) to inflict on the real authors of the outbreak the punishment they so richly deserved.\"\nLalor stood for in the 1855 elections and was elected unopposed.\nDuring a speech in the Legislative Council in 1856 he said, \"I would ask these gentlemen what they mean by the term 'democracy'. Do they mean Chartism or Republicanism? If so, I never was, I am not now, nor do I ever intend to be a democrat. But if a democrat means opposition to a tyrannical press, a tyrannical people, or a tyrannical government, then I have been, I am still, and will ever remain a democrat.\"\nPolitical legacy.\nThe actual significance of Eureka upon Australia's politics is not decisive. It has been variously interpreted as a revolt of free men against imperial tyranny, of independent free enterprise against burdensome taxation, of labour against a privileged ruling class, or as an expression of republicanism. In his 1897 travel book \"Following the Equator\", American writer Mark Twain wrote of the Eureka Rebellion:\nRaffaello Carboni, who was present at the Stockade, wrote that \"amongst the foreigners\u00a0... there was no democratic feeling, but merely a spirit of resistance to the licence fee\"; and he also disputes the accusations \"that have branded the miners of Ballarat as disloyal to their QUEEN\" (emphasis as in the original). The affair continues to raise echoes in Australian politics to the present day, and from time to time one group or another calls for the existing Australian flag to be replaced by the Eureka Flag.\nSome historians believe that the prominence of the event in the public record has come about because Australian history does not include a major armed rebellion phase equivalent to the French Revolution, the English Civil War, or the American War of Independence, making the Eureka story inflated well beyond its real significance. Others, however, maintain that Eureka was a seminal event and that it marked a major change in the course of Australian history.\nIn 1980, historian Geoffrey Blainey drew attention to the fact that many miners were temporary migrants from Britain and the United States, who did not intend to settle permanently in Australia. He wrote:\nIn 1999, the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, dismissed the Eureka Stockade as a \"protest without consequence\". Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson made the Eureka flag a federal election campaign issue in 2004 saying \"I think people have tried to make too much of the Eureka Stockade...trying to give it a credibility and standing that it probably doesn't enjoy.\"\nIn 2004, the Premier of Victoria, Steve Bracks, delivered an opening address at the Eureka 150 Democracy Conference stating \"that Eureka was about the struggle for basic democratic rights. It was not about a riot \u2013 it was about rights.\"\nCommemoration.\nThe materials used to build the stockade were rapidly removed to be used for the mines, and the entire area around the site was so extensively worked that the original landscape became unrecognisable, so identifying the exact location of the stockade is now virtually impossible.\nA diggers' memorial was erected in the Ballarat Cemetery on 22 March 1856 near marked graves. Sculpted in stone from the Barrabool Hills by James Leggatt in Geelong it features a pillar bearing the names of the deceased miners and bearing the inscription \"Sacred to the memory of those who fell on the memorable 3 December 1854, in resisting the unconstitutional proceedings of the Victorian Government.\"\nA soldiers' memorial was erected many years later in 1876 and is an obelisk constructed of limestone sourced from Waurn Ponds with the words \"Victoria\" and \"Duty\" carved in its north and south faces respectively. In 1879 a cast-iron fence was added to the memorials and graves.\nOver the next thirty years, press interest in the events that had taken place at the Eureka Stockade dwindled, but Eureka was kept alive at the campfires and in the pubs, and in memorial events in Ballarat. In addition, key figures such as Lalor and Humfray were still in the public eye.\nEureka had not been forgotten: it was readily remembered. Similar flags have been flown at rebellions since including a flag similar to the Eureka flag which was flown above the Barcaldine strike camp in the 1891 Australian shearers' strike.\nIn 1889, Melbourne businessmen employed renowned American cyclorama artist Thaddeus Welch, who teamed up with local artist Izett Watson to paint of canvas of the Eureka Stockade, wrapped around a wooden structure. When it opened in Melbourne, the exhibition was an instant hit. \"The Age\" reported in 1891 that \"it afforded a very good opportunity for people to see what it might have been like at Eureka\". \"The Australasian\" wrote \"that many persons familiar with the incidents depicted, were able to testify to the fidelity of the painted scene\". The people of Melbourne flocked to the cyclorama, paid up and had their picture taken before it. It was eventually dismantled and disappeared from sight.\nMemorials to soldiers and miners are located in the Ballaarat Old Cemetery and the Eureka Stockade Memorial is located within the Eureka Stockade Gardens and is listed on the Australian National Heritage List.\nIn 1954, the centenary of the event was officially celebrated; according to Geoffrey Blainey, who was in attendance, no one, apart from a small group of communists, was there. Plays commemorating the events were held at major theatres. \nA purpose built Interpretation centre was erected in 1998 in suburb of Eureka near the site of the stockade. Designed to be a new landmark for Ballarat, the building featured an enormous sail emblazoned with the Eureka Flag. Before its development there was considerable debate over whether a replica or reconstruction of wooden structures was appropriate, however it was eventually decided against and this is seen by many as a reason for the apparent failure of the centre to draw significant tourist numbers. Due primarily to falling visitor numbers the centre was redeveloped between 2009 and 2011.\nIn 1992, Sovereign Hill commenced a commemorative son et lumi\u00e8re known as \"Blood Under the Southern Cross\" which became a tourist drawcard and was revised and expanded from 2003. In 2004, the 150th anniversary was celebrated. An Australian postage stamp featuring the Eureka Flag was released along with a set of commemorative coins. A ceremony in Ballarat known as the lantern walk was held at dawn. However, Prime Minister John Howard did not attend any commemorative events, and refused to allow the flag to fly over Parliament House.\nIn November 2004 then Premier of Victoria Steve Bracks announced that the Ballarat V/Line rail service would be renamed the \"Eureka Line\" to mark the 150th anniversary to take effect from late 2005 at the same time as a renaming of Spencer Street station to Southern Cross, however the proposal was criticised by community groups including the Public Transport Users Association. Renaming of the line did not go ahead, however Spencer Street (railway) Station did become Southern Cross Station on 13 December 2005 with Bracks stating the name would resonate with Victorians because it \"stands for democracy and freedom because it flew over the Eureka Stockade\".\nEureka Tower, completed in 2006 is named in honour of the event and features symbolic aspects in its design including an architectural red stripe representing the blood spilled during the battle.\nThe site of the Eureka Stockade in Ballarat is currently being redeveloped with the support of grants from the City of Ballarat and the Victorian and Federal Governments. It will feature the new Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka (M.A.D.E) that will draw on the touchstone of Eureka and its newly restored flag, and put the Eureka Stockade into the context of 260 years of democracy.\nM.A.D.E.'s highly interactive exhibition, based on the premise of \"People + Power = Democracy\", is expected to open in early 2013, followed by a national rollout of public onsite and online programs.\nDeputy Premier, the Hon. Peter Ryan, told the Legislative Assembly, sitting in Ballarat in 2012, that M.A.D.E. would be \"a magnificent tribute to the events\" of the Eureka Stockade.\nThe Museum's \"M.A.D.E. You Look\" booklet says M.A.D.E will be 'an online platform and immersive museum with a refreshing approach to culture, civics, history and citizenship. M.A.D.E puts the past into a contemporary context, celebrates Australia's achievements and inspires new ways of thinking about issues like equality, freedom of speech, parliamentary representation and the rule of law'. The museum 'will ignite debate about what it means to be an effective Australian in the 21st Century'.\nPopular culture.\nFilm and television.\n\"Eureka Stockade\" (1907), directed by Arthur and George Cornwell and produced by the Australasian Cinematograph Company, was the second feature film made in Australia (the first being the 1906 production, \"The Story of the Kelly Gang\"). The film was first screened on 19 October 1907 at the Melbourne Athenaeum. The film impressed critics of the time and was found to be a stirring portrayal of the events surrounding the Eureka Stockade, but failed to connect with audiences during the two weeks it was screened. The surviving seven-minute fragment (stored at the National Film and Sound Archive) shows street scenes of Ballarat. Other scenes in the lost reels of the film were believed to have included gold seekers leaving London, issuing of licences, licence hunting, diggers chained to logs and rescued by mates, diggers burning Bentley's Hotel, the Rebellion, building the stockade, troops storming the stockade and the stockade in ruins.\n\"The Loyal Rebel\", also known as \"Eureka Stockade\", is an Australian silent film made in 1915. Directed by Alfred Rolfe, it starred Maisie Carte, Wynn Davies, Reynolds Denniston, Charles Villiers, Percy Walshe, Jena Williams, and Leslie Victor as Peter Lalor. It is considered a lost film.\nA 1949 British film, titled \"Eureka Stockade\" (released in the United States as \"Massacre Hill\"), was shot in Australia. The film starred Chips Rafferty as Peter Lalor, and Peter Illing as Raffaello Carboni. It was directed by Harry Watt, produced by Leslie Norman and written by Walter Greenwood, Ralph Smart and Harry Watt.\n\"Stockade\", a 1971 Australian musical film featuring Rod Mullinar as Peter Lalor, was directed by Hans Pomeranz and Ross McGregor. The film was written by Kenneth Cook, adapted from his musical play.\n\"Eureka Stockade\" was a two-part television mini-series which aired on the Seven Network in 1984. starring Bryan Brown as Peter Lalor. Directed by Rod Hardy, produced by Henry Crawford and written by Tom Hegarty. The cast included Carol Burns, Bill Hunter and Brett Cullen.\n\"Riot or Revolution: Eureka Stockade 1854\", an Australian documentary from 2006, directed by Don Parham. The film focuses mainly on Governor Sir Charles Hotham (played by Brian Lipson), Raffaello Carboni (Barry Kay), and Douglas Huyghue (Tim Robertson). The accounts of these eyewitnesses are the main source for the monologues directly aimed at the audience, and, as the caption at the start of the film says: \"the lines spoken by actors in this film are the documented words of the historical characters.\"\nThe cast also included Julia Zemiro as Celeste de Chabrillan and Andrew Larkins as Peter Lalor.\nIt was filmed in Ballarat and \"Toorac House\" in Melbourne.\nStage.\n\"Stockade\", a musical play by Kenneth Cook and Patricia Cook, was first performed at Sydney's Independent Theatre in 1971. It was the basis for the film \"Stockade\".\n\"Carboni\" is a dramatisation by John Romeril of Raffaello Carboni's eyewitness account of the Eureka Rebellion. It was first performed in 1980 by the Australian Performing Group at the Pram Factory in Melbourne, with Bruce Spence in the title role.\n\"Eureka Stockade\", a three-act opera with music by Roberto Hazon and a libretto by John Picton-Warlow and Carlo Stransky, was completed in 1988.\nThe musical \"Eureka\" premiered in Melbourne in 2004 at Her Majesty's Theatre.

It stars Kurt Russell, Lee Van Cleef, Donald Pleasence, Ernest Borgnine, Isaac Hayes, Adrienne Barbeau, and Harry Dean Stanton.\nThe film's storyline, set in the near-future world of 1997, concerns a crime-ridden United States, which has converted Manhattan Island in New York City into the country's maximum-security prison. Air Force One is hijacked by insurgents and is deliberately crashed in New York City. Ex-soldier and current federal prisoner Snake Plissken (Russell) is given just 24 hours to go in and rescue the President of the United States, after which, if successful, Snake will be pardoned.\nCarpenter wrote the film in the mid-1970s in reaction to the Watergate scandal. After the success of \"Halloween\" (1978), he had enough influence to begin production and filmed it mainly in St. Louis, Missouri, on an estimated budget of $6 million. Debra Hill and Larry J. Franco served as the producers. The film was co-written by Nick Castle, who had collaborated with Carpenter by portraying Michael Myers in \"Halloween\".\nReleased in the United States on July 10, 1981, the film received positive reviews from critics and was a commercial success, grossing more than $25 million at the box office. The film was nominated for four Saturn Awards, including Best Science Fiction Film and Best Direction. The film became a cult classic and was followed by a sequel, \"Escape from L.A.\" (1996), which was also directed and written by Carpenter and starred Russell, but was much less favorably received.\nPlot.\nIn a dystopian 1988, amidst total war against China and the Soviet Union, the United States government has turned Manhattan into a giant maximum-security prison to deal with a 400% increase in crime. A wall surrounds the island, bridges have been mined, rivers are patrolled by helicopters, and all prisoners are sentenced to life terms.\nIn 1997, while flying the President of the United States to a peace summit in Hartford, Connecticut, Air Force One is hijacked by a guerilla fighter of the communist \"National Liberation Front\", named in reference to the Viet Cong. The President is given a tracking bracelet and is handcuffed to his briefcase before being escorted to an escape pod. The aircraft crashes but the pod survives.\nPolice are dispatched to rescue the President. Romero, the right-hand man of the Duke of New York, the overall crime boss, warns that the President has been captured and will be killed if any further rescue attempts are made. Meanwhile, former Special Forces soldier Snake Plissken is about to be sent into Manhattan after being convicted of robbing the Federal Reserve. Police Commissioner Bob Hauk offers a deal to Snake: if he rescues the President in time for the summit, Hauk will arrange a presidential pardon. To keep Snake from going rogue, Hauk has him injected with micro-explosives that will sever his carotid arteries in 22 hours. If Snake is successful, Hauk will neutralize the explosives.\nUsing a stealth glider to land atop the World Trade Center, Snake follows the tracking bracelet to a vaudeville theater, only to find it on the wrist of a deluded old man. Convinced the President is dead, Snake radios Hauk but is told that he will be shot down if he returns without the President.\nSnake meets \"Cabbie\" who drives an armored taxi that takes Snake to Harold \"Brain\" Hellman, an adviser to the Duke and a former associate of Snake. Brain, a brilliant engineer, has established an oil well and a small refinery, fueling the city's remaining cars, and tells Snake that the Duke plans to lead a mass escape across the Queensboro Bridge by using the President as a human shield and following a landmine map that Brain has drawn up. Snake forces Brain and his girlfriend Maggie to lead him to the Duke's hideout at Grand Central Terminal. Snake finds the President but is captured.\nWhile Snake is forced to fight in a deathmatch against \"Slag\", Brain and Maggie kill Romero and flee with the President. Snake kills Slag and finds Brain, Maggie, and the President at the top of the World Trade Center trying to escape in the glider. After a band of inmates pushes it off the building, destroying it, the group returns to street level and encounters Cabbie, who offers to take them across the bridge. Cabbie reveals that he bartered with Romero for the contents of the briefcase; a cassette tape which contains information about nuclear fusion, intended to be an international peace offering. The President demands the tape, but Snake claims it.\nThe Duke pursues them onto the bridge in his customized Cadillac, setting off mines as he tries to catch up. Brain guides Snake, but they hit a mine, and Cabbie is killed. As they continue on foot, Brain is killed by another mine. Maggie refuses to leave him, shooting at Duke's car until she is run down. Snake and the President reach the containment wall, and guards hoist the President up. The Duke opens fire, killing the guards before Snake subdues him; he attempts to shoot Snake as he is being lifted up by the rope, but the President opens fire on the Duke with a dead guard's assault rifle, violently killing him, before the President finishes lifting Snake. Hauk's doctor saves Snake's life with just seconds to spare. \nAs the President prepares for a televised speech to the leaders at the summit meeting, he thanks Snake and tells him that he can have anything he wants. All Snake wants to know is how the President feels about the people who died saving him. The President offers only half-hearted regret and lip service for their sacrifice; Snake walks away disgusted. Hauk offers him a job as his deputy, but Snake just keeps walking. The President's live speech commences, and he plays the cassette tape. To his embarrassment, it only plays Cabbie's song, \"Bandstand Boogie\". As Snake walks away, he intentionally tears the magnetic tape out of the cassette reel, destroying the actual message that was intended to be delivered by the President.\nCast.\nIn addition, frequent Carpenter collaborators Nancy Stephens appeared as the Stewardess / Hijacker and Buck Flower appeared as the Drunk with the president's tracker, respectively, while then-active professional wrestler \nOx Baker played 'Slag'. The narrator was voiced by Jamie Lee Curtis. Actor Joe Unger filmed scenes as Snake's partner-in-crime Bill Taylor, but they were cut from the final film.\nProduction.\nDevelopment and writing.\nCarpenter originally wrote the screenplay for \"Escape from New York\" in 1976, in the aftermath of Nixon's Watergate scandal. Carpenter said, \"The whole feeling of the nation was one of real cynicism about the president.\" He wrote the screenplay, but no studio wanted to make it because, according to Carpenter, \"[i]t was too violent, too scary, [and] too weird\". He had been inspired by the film \"Death Wish\", which was very popular at the time. He did not agree with this film's philosophy, but liked how it conveyed \"the sense of New York as a kind of jungle, and I wanted to make a science-fiction film along these lines\".\nInternational Film Investors agreed to provide 50% of the budget, and Goldcrest Films signed a co-financing deal with them. They ended up providing \u00a3720,000 of the budget and making a profit of \u00a3672,000 from their investment after earning \u00a31,392,000.\nCasting.\nAVCO Embassy Pictures, the film's financial backer, preferred either Charles Bronson or Tommy Lee Jones to play the role of Snake Plissken to Carpenter's choice of Kurt Russell, who was trying to overcome the \"lightweight\" screen image conveyed by his roles in several Disney comedies. Carpenter refused to cast Bronson on the grounds that he was too old, and because he worried that he could lose directorial control over the picture with an experienced actor. At the time, Russell described his character as \"a mercenary, and his style of fighting is a combination of Bruce Lee, The Exterminator, and Darth Vader, with Eastwood's vocal-ness.\" All that matters to Snake, according to the actor, is \"the next 60 seconds. Living for exactly that next minute is all there is.\" Russell used a rigorous diet and exercise program to develop a lean and muscular build. He also endeavored to stay in character between takes and throughout the shooting, as he welcomed the opportunity to get away from the Disney comedies he had done previously. He did find it necessary to remove the eyepatch between takes, as wearing it constantly seriously affected his depth perception.\nPre-production.\nCarpenter had just made \"Dark Star\", but no one wanted to hire him as a director, so he assumed he would make it in Hollywood as a screenwriter. The filmmaker went on to do other films with the intention of making \"Escape\" later. After the success of \"Halloween\", Avco-Embassy signed producer Debra Hill and him to a two-picture deal. The first film from this contract was \"The Fog\". Initially, the second film he was going to make to finish the contract was \"The Philadelphia Experiment\", but because of script-writing problems, Carpenter rejected it in favor of this project. However, Carpenter felt something was missing and recalls, \"This was basically a straight action film. And at one point, I realized it really doesn't have this kind of crazy humor that people from New York would expect to see.\" He brought in Nick Castle, a friend from his film-school days at University of Southern California, who played \"The Shape\" in \"Halloween\". Castle invented the Cabbie character and came up with the film's ending.\nThe film's setting proved to be a potential problem for Carpenter, who needed to create a decaying, semi-destroyed version of New York City on a shoestring budget. The film's production designer Joe Alves and he rejected shooting on location in New York City because it would be too hard to make it look like a destroyed city. Carpenter suggested shooting on a movie back lot, but Alves nixed that idea \"because the texture of a real street is not like a back lot.\" They sent Barry Bernardi, their location manager (and associate producer), \"on a sort of all-expense-paid trip across the country looking for the worst city in America,\" producer Debra Hill remembers.\nBernardi suggested East St. Louis, Illinois because it was filled with old buildings \"that exist in New York now, and [that] have that seedy run-down quality\" that the team was looking for. East St. Louis, sitting across the Mississippi River from the more prosperous St. Louis, Missouri, had entire neighborhoods burned out in 1976 during a massive urban fire. Hill said in an interview, \"block after block was burnt-out rubble. In some places, there was absolutely nothing, so that you could see three and four blocks away.\" Also, Alves found an old bridge to double for the \"69th St. Bridge\". The filmmaker purchased the Old Chain of Rocks Bridge for one dollar from the government and then gave it back to them, for the same amount, once production was completed, \"so that they wouldn't have any liability,\" Hill remembers. Locations across the river in St. Louis were used, including Union Station and the Fox Theatre, both of which have since been renovated, as well as the building that would eventually become the Schlafly Tap Room microbrewery.\nFilming.\nCarpenter and his crew persuaded the city to shut off the electricity to 10 blocks at a time at night. The film was shot from August to November 1980. It was a tough and demanding shoot for the filmmaker as he recalls. \"We'd finish shooting at about 6 am and I'd just be going to sleep at 7 when the sun would be coming up. I'd wake up around 5 or 6 pm, depending on whether or not we had dailies, and by the time I got going, the sun would be setting. So for about two and a half months I never saw daylight, which was really strange.\" The gladiatorial fight to the death scene between Snake and Slag (played by professional wrestler Ox Baker) was filmed in the Grand Hall at St. Louis Union Station. Russell has stated, \"That day was a nightmare. All I did was swing a [spiked] bat at that guy and get swung at in return. He threw a trash can in my face about five times ... I could have wound up in pretty bad shape.\" In addition to shooting on location in St. Louis, Carpenter shot parts of the film in Los Angeles. Various interior scenes were shot on a sound stage; the final scenes were shot at the Sepulveda Dam, in Sherman Oaks. New York served as a location, as did Atlanta, to use their futuristic-looking rapid-transit system (the latter scenes were cut from the final film). In New York City, Carpenter persuaded federal officials to grant access to Liberty Island. \"We were the first film company in history allowed to shoot on Liberty Island at the Statue of Liberty at night. They let us have the whole island to ourselves. We were lucky. It wasn't easy to get that initial permission. They'd had a bombing three months earlier and were worried about trouble\".\nCarpenter was interested in creating two distinct looks for the movie. \"One is the police state, high tech, lots of neon, a United States dominated by underground computers. That was easy to shoot compared to the Manhattan Island prison sequences, which had few lights, mainly torch lights, like feudal England\". Certain matte paintings were rendered by James Cameron, who was at the time a special-effects artist with Roger Corman's New World Pictures. Cameron was also one of the directors of photography on the film. As Snake pilots the glider into the city, three screens on his control panel display wireframe animations of the landing target on the World Trade Center and surrounding buildings. Carpenter wanted high-tech computer graphics, which were very expensive, even for such a simple animation. The effects crew filmed the miniature model set of New York City they used for other scenes under black light, with reflective tape placed along every edge of the model buildings. Only the tape is visible and appears to be a three-dimensional wireframe animation.\nRelease.\nHome media.\nLaserDisc releases.\n\"Escape from New York\" was released on LaserDisc 13 times between 1983 and 1998. A 1994 Collector's Edition includes a commentary track by John Carpenter and Kurt Russell that is still included on more recent DVD releases of the film.\nDVD releases.\n\"Escape from New York\" was released on DVD twice by MGM (USA), and once by Momentum Pictures (UK). One MGM release is a barebones edition containing just the theatrical trailer. Another version is the Collector's Edition, a two-disc set featuring a high definition remastered transfer with a 5.1 Stereo audio track, two commentaries (one by John Carpenter and Kurt Russell, another by producer Debra Hill and Joe Alves), a making-of featurette, the first issue of a comic book series titled \"John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles\", and the 10-minute Colorado bank robbery deleted opening sequence.\nMGM's special edition of the 1981 film was not released until 2003 because the original negative had gone missing. The workprint containing deleted scenes finally turned up in the Hutchinson, Kansas, salt-mine film depository. The excised scenes feature Snake Plissken robbing a bank, introducing the character of Plissken and establishing a backstory. Director John Carpenter decided to add the original scenes into the special edition release as an extra only: \"After we screened the rough cut, we realized that the movie didn't really start until Snake got to New York. It wasn't necessary to show what sent him there.\" The film has been released on the UMD format for Sony's PlayStation Portable.\nBlu-ray release.\nOn August 3, 2010, MGM Home Entertainment released \"Escape From New York\" as a bare-bones Blu-ray. Scream Factory, in association with Shout! Factory, released the film on a special edition Blu-ray on April 21, 2015.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Escape from New York\" opened in New York and Los Angeles July 10, 1981. The film grossed $25.2 million in American theaters in summer 1981. \nCritical response.\nThe film received generally positive reviews. \"Newsweek\" magazine wrote of Carpenter: \"[He has a] deeply ingrained B-movie sensibility\u00a0\u2013 which is both his strength and limitation. He does clean work, but settles for too little. He uses Russell well, however\". In \"Time\" magazine, Richard Corliss wrote, \"John Carpenter is offering this summer's moviegoers a rare opportunity: to escape from the air-conditioned torpor of ordinary entertainment into the hothouse humidity of their own paranoia. It's a trip worth taking\". Vincent Canby, in his review for \"The New York Times\", wrote, \"[The film] is not to be analyzed too solemnly, though. It's a toughly told, very tall tale, one of the best escape (and escapist) movies of the season\". On the other hand, in his negative review for the \"Chicago Reader\", critic Dave Kehr, wrote \"it fails to satisfy \u2013 it gives us too little of too much\".\nChristopher John reviewed \"Escape from New York\" in \"Ares Magazine\" #10 and commented that \"It is solid summer entertainment of unusually high caliber. By not pretending to be more than it is, but by also not settling for any \"less\" than it could be, \"Escape\" becomes an exciting, fast-moving drama, the likes of which we haven't seen in years.\"\nIt received an 86% positive rating at the film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes from 64 reviews, with the critical consensus: \"Featuring an atmospherically grimy futuristic metropolis, \"Escape from New York\" is a strange, entertaining jumble of thrilling action and oddball weirdness\".\nCyberpunk pioneer William Gibson credits the film as an influence on his 1984 science fiction novel \"Neuromancer\". \"I was intrigued by the exchange in one of the opening scenes where the Warden says to Snake 'You flew the Gullfire over Leningrad, didn't you?' It turns out to be just a throwaway line, but for a moment it worked like the best SF where a casual reference can imply a lot\". Popular video game director Hideo Kojima has referred to the film frequently as an influence on his work, in particular the \"Metal Gear\" series. Solid Snake is partially influenced by the character Snake Plissken. In ' Snake uses the alias \"Pliskin\" to hide his real identity during most of the game. J. J. Abrams, producer of the 2008 film \"Cloverfield\", mentioned that a scene in his film, which shows the head of the Statue of Liberty crashing into a New York street, was inspired by the poster for \"Escape from New York\". \"Empire\" magazine ranked Snake Plissken #29 in their \"The 100 Greatest Movie Characters\" poll.\nOther media.\nSequel.\nA sequel, \"Escape from L.A.\", was released in 1996, with Carpenter returning along with Russell, now also acting as producer and co-writer.\nRemake.\nIn March 2017, it was announced that Robert Rodriguez would direct a remake of the film with Carpenter producing it. In February 2019, it was reported that Leigh Whannell will be writing the script after \"Luther\" creator Neil Cross completed a recent iteration of the project.\nMaking of Book.\nScreen Rant announced the publication a new book on the making of the film by John Walsh entitled, Escape From New York The Official Story of the Film to be published on September 28th 2021 by Titan Books.\nNovelization.\nIn 1981, Bantam Books published a movie tie-in novelization written by Mike McQuay that adopts a lean, humorous style reminiscent of the film. The novel includes significant scenes that were cut from the film, such as the Federal Reserve Depository robbery that results in Snake's incarceration. The novel provides background on the relationship between Snake and Hauk\u2014presenting the characters as disillusioned war veterans, and deepening the relationship that was only hinted in the film. The novel also explains how Snake lost his eye during the Battle for Leningrad in World War III, how Hauk became warden of New York, and Hauk's quest to find his crazed son, who lives somewhere in the prison. The novel gives greater detail on the world in which these characters live, at times presenting a future even bleaker than the one depicted in the film. It explains that the West Coast is a no-man's land, and the nation's population is gradually being driven insane by nerve gas as a result of World War III. The novel also clarifies that the president's plan for the cassette tape is not benevolent. Rather than presenting to the world a new energy source in the form of nuclear fusion (as claimed in the film), the tape actually reveals the successful development of a \"fallout-free thermonuclear weapon, which would grant the US supremacy in the global conflict.\nComic books.\nMarvel Comics released the one-shot \"The Adventures of Snake Plissken\" in January 1997. The story takes place sometime between \"Escape from New York\" and before his famous Cleveland escape mentioned in \"Escape from L.A.\" Snake has robbed Atlanta's Centers for Disease Control of some engineered metaviruses and is looking for buyers in Chicago. Finding himself in a deal that is really a set-up, he makes his getaway and exacts revenge on the buyer for ratting him out to the United States Police Force. In the meantime, a government lab has built a robot called ATACS (Autonomous Tracking And Combat System) that can catch criminals by imprinting their personalities upon its program to predict and anticipate a specific criminal's every move. The robot's first test subject is America's public enemy number one, Snake Plissken. After a brief battle, the tide turns when ATACS copies Snake to the point of fully becoming his personality. Now recognizing the government as the enemy, ATACS sides with Snake. Unamused, Snake sucker punches the machine and destroys it. As ATACS shuts down, it can only ask him, \"Why?\" Snake just walks off, answering, \"I don't need the competition\".\nIn 2003, CrossGen published \"John Carpenter's Snake Plissken Chronicles\", a four-part comic book miniseries. The story takes place a day or so after the events of \"Escape from New York\". Snake has been given a military Humvee after his presidential pardon and makes his way to Atlantic City. Although the director's cut of \"Escape from New York\" shows Snake was caught after a bank job, this story has Snake finishing up a second heist that was planned before his capture. The job entails stealing the car in which John F. Kennedy was assassinated from a casino before delivering it to a buyer in the Gulf of Mexico. Snake partners with a man named Marrs who ends up double-crossing him. Left for dead in a sinking crab cage, Snake escapes and is saved by a passing fisherman named Captain Ron (an in-joke referring to Kurt Russell's 1992 comedy, \"Captain Ron\"). When Ron denies Snake's request to use his boat to beat Marrs to the robbery, Snake decides to kill him. When Snake ends up saving Ron from the Russian mob, who wants money, Ron changes his mind and helps Snake. Once at the casino, Snake comes face-to-face with Marrs and his men, who arrive at the same time, ending in a high-speed shootout. Snake gets away with the car and its actress portraying Jackie Kennedy, leaving Marrs to be caught by the casino owner, who cuts him a deal to bring his car back and live. After some trouble, Snake manages to finally get the car to the buyer's yacht, using Ron's boat, and is then attacked by Marrs. Following the firefight, the yacht and car are destroyed, Marrs and Captain Ron are dead, and Snake makes his escape in a helicopter with the 30 million credits owed to him for the job.\nIn 2014, BOOM! Studios began publishing an \"Escape From New York\" comic book by writer, Christopher Sebela. The first issue of the series was released on December 3, 2014, and the story picks up moments after the end of the film.\nBOOM! released a crossover comics miniseries between Snake and Jack Burton titled \"Big Trouble in Little China / Escape from New York\" in October 2016.\nBoard game.\nAn \"Escape from New York\" board game was released in 1981 by TSR, Inc.\nCancelled anime.\nIn 2003, Carpenter was planning an anime spin-off of \"Escape from New York\", with \"Outlaw Star\"s Mitsuru Hongo slated to direct."}
{"id": "9837", "revid": "30365968", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9837", "title": "Ethylene", "text": "Ethylene (IUPAC name: ethene) is a hydrocarbon which has the formula or H2C=CH2. It is a colorless flammable gas with a faint \"sweet and musky\" odour when pure. It is the simplest alkene (a hydrocarbon with carbon-carbon double bonds).\nEthylene is widely used in the chemical industry, and its worldwide production (over 150 million tonnes in 2016) exceeds that of any other organic compound. Much of this production goes toward polyethylene, a widely used plastic containing polymer chains of ethylene units in various chain lengths. Ethylene is also an important natural plant hormone and is used in agriculture to force the ripening of fruits. The hydrate of ethylene is ethanol.\nStructure and properties.\nThis hydrocarbon has four hydrogen atoms bound to a pair of carbon atoms that are connected by a double bond. All six atoms that comprise ethylene are coplanar. The H-C-H angle is 117.4\u00b0, close to the 120\u00b0 for ideal sp\u00b2 hybridized carbon. The molecule is also relatively weak: rotation about the C-C bond is a very low energy process that requires breaking the \u03c0-bond by supplying heat at 50\u00b0C.\nThe \u03c0-bond in the ethylene molecule is responsible for its useful reactivity. The double bond is a region of high electron density, thus it is susceptible to attack by electrophiles. Many reactions of ethylene are catalyzed by transition metals, which bind transiently to the ethylene using both the \u03c0 and \u03c0* orbitals.\nBeing a simple molecule, ethylene is spectroscopically simple. Its UV-vis spectrum is still used as a test of theoretical methods.\nUses.\nMajor industrial reactions of ethylene include in order of scale: 1) polymerization, 2) oxidation, 3) halogenation and hydrohalogenation, 4) alkylation, 5) hydration, 6) oligomerization, and 7) hydroformylation. In the United States and Europe, approximately 90% of ethylene is used to produce ethylene oxide, ethylene dichloride, ethylbenzene and polyethylene. Most of the reactions with ethylene are electrophilic addition.\nPolymerization.\nPolyethylene consumes more than half of the world's ethylene supply. Polyethylene, also called \"polyethene\" and \"polythene\", is the world's most widely used plastic. It is primarily used to make films in packaging, carrier bags and trash liners. Linear alpha-olefins, produced by oligomerization (formation of short polymers) are used as precursors, detergents, plasticisers, synthetic lubricants, additives, and also as co-monomers in the production of polyethylenes.\nOxidation.\nEthylene is oxidized to produce ethylene oxide, a key raw material in the production of surfactants and detergents by ethoxylation. Ethylene oxide is also hydrolyzed to produce ethylene glycol, widely used as an automotive antifreeze as well as higher molecular weight glycols, glycol ethers, and polyethylene terephthalate.\nEthylene undergoes oxidation by palladium to give acetaldehyde. This conversion remains a major industrial process (10M kg/y). The process proceeds via the initial complexation of ethylene to a Pd(II) center.\nHalogenation and hydrohalogenation.\nMajor intermediates from the halogenation and hydrohalogenation of ethylene include ethylene dichloride, ethyl chloride, and ethylene dibromide. The addition of chlorine entails \"oxychlorination\", i.e. chlorine itself is not used. Some products derived from this group are polyvinyl chloride, trichloroethylene, perchloroethylene, methyl chloroform, polyvinylidene chloride and copolymers, and ethyl bromide.\nAlkylation.\nMajor chemical intermediates from the alkylation with ethylene is ethylbenzene, precursor to styrene. Styrene is used principally in polystyrene for packaging and insulation, as well as in styrene-butadiene rubber for tires and footwear. On a smaller scale, ethyltoluene, ethylanilines, 1,4-hexadiene, and aluminium alkyls. Products of these intermediates include polystyrene, unsaturated polyesters and ethylene-propylene terpolymers.\nOxo reaction.\nThe hydroformylation (oxo reaction) of ethylene results in propionaldehyde, a precursor to propionic acid and n-propyl alcohol.\nHydration.\nEthylene has long represented the major nonfermentative precursor to ethanol. The original method entailed its conversion to diethyl sulfate, followed by hydrolysis. The main method practiced since the mid-1990s is the direct hydration of ethylene catalyzed by solid acid catalysts:\nDimerization to butenes.\nEthylene is dimerized by hydrovinylation to give \"n\"-butenes using processes licensed by Lummus or IFP. The Lummus process produces mixed \"n\"-butenes (primarily 2-butenes) while the IFP process produces 1-butene. 1-Butene is used as a comonomer in the production of certain kinds of polyethylene.\nFruit and flowering.\nEthylene is a hormone that affects the ripening and flowering of many plants. It is widely used to control freshness in horticulture and fruits.\nNiche uses.\nAn example of a niche use is as an anesthetic agent (in an 85% ethylene/15% oxygen ratio). Another use is as a welding gas.\nProduction.\nGlobal ethylene production was 107 million tonnes in 2005, 109 million tonnes in 2006, 138 million tonnes in 2010, and 141 million tonnes in 2011. By 2013, ethylene was produced by at least 117 companies in 32 countries. To meet the ever-increasing demand for ethylene, sharp increases in production facilities are added globally, particularly in the Mideast and in China.\nIndustrial process.\nEthylene is produced by several methods in the petrochemical industry. A primary method is steam cracking (SC) where hydrocarbons and steam are heated to 750\u2013950\u00a0\u00b0C. This process converts large hydrocarbons into smaller ones and introduces unsaturation. When ethane is the feedstock, ethylene is the product. Ethylene is separated from the resulting mixture by repeated compression and distillation. In Europe and Asia, ethylene is obtained mainly from cracking naphtha, gasoil and condensates with the coproduction of propylene, C4 olefins and aromatics (pyrolysis gasoline). Other technologies employed for the production of ethylene include oxidative coupling of methane, Fischer-Tropsch synthesis, methanol-to-olefins (MTO), and catalytic dehydrogenation.\nLaboratory synthesis.\nAlthough of great value industrially, ethylene is rarely synthesized in the laboratory and is ordinarily purchased. It can be produced via dehydration of ethanol with sulfuric acid or in the gas phase with aluminium oxide.\nBiosynthesis.\nEthylene is produced from methionine in nature. The immediate precursor is 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid.\nLigand.\nEthylene is a fundamental ligand in transition metal alkene complexes. One of the first organometallic compounds, Zeise's salt is a complex of ethylene. Useful reagents containing ethylene include Pt(PPh3)2(C2H4) and Rh2Cl2(C2H4)4. The Rh-catalysed hydroformylation of ethylene is conducted on industrial scale to provide propionaldehyde.\nHistory.\nSome geologists and scholars believe that the famous Greek Oracle at Delphi (the Pythia) went into her trance-like state as an effect of ethylene rising from ground faults.\nEthylene appears to have been discovered by Johann Joachim Becher, who obtained it by heating ethanol with sulfuric acid; he mentioned the gas in his \"Physica Subterranea\" (1669). Joseph Priestley also mentions the gas in his \"Experiments and observations relating to the various branches of natural philosophy: with a continuation of the observations on air\" (1779), where he reports that Jan Ingenhousz saw ethylene synthesized in the same way by a Mr. En\u00e9e in Amsterdam in 1777 and that Ingenhousz subsequently produced the gas himself. The properties of ethylene were studied in 1795 by four Dutch chemists, Johann Rudolph Deimann, Adrien Paets van Troostwyck, Anthoni Lauwerenburgh and Nicolas Bondt, who found that it differed from hydrogen gas and that it contained both carbon and hydrogen. This group also discovered that ethylene could be combined with chlorine to produce the \"oil of the Dutch chemists\", 1,2-dichloroethane; this discovery gave ethylene the name used for it at that time, \"olefiant gas\" (oil-making gas.) The term olefiant gas is in turn the etymological origin of the modern word \"olefin\", the class of hydrocarbons in which ethylene is the first member.\nIn the mid-19th century, the suffix \"-ene\" (an Ancient Greek root added to the end of female names meaning \"daughter of\") was widely used to refer to a molecule or part thereof that contained one fewer hydrogen atoms than the molecule being modified. Thus, \"ethylene\" () was the \"daughter of ethyl\" (). The name ethylene was used in this sense as early as 1852.\nIn 1866, the German chemist August Wilhelm von Hofmann proposed a system of hydrocarbon nomenclature in which the suffixes -ane, -ene, -ine, -one, and -une were used to denote the hydrocarbons with 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 fewer hydrogens than their parent alkane. In this system, ethylene became \"ethene\". Hofmann's system eventually became the basis for the Geneva nomenclature approved by the International Congress of Chemists in 1892, which remains at the core of the IUPAC nomenclature. However, by that time, the name ethylene was deeply entrenched, and it remains in wide use today, especially in the chemical industry.\nFollowing experimentation by Luckhardt, Crocker, and Carter at the University of Chicago, ethylene was used as an anesthetic. It remained in use through the 1940s use even while chloroform was being phased out. Its pungent odor and its explosive nature limit its use today.\nNomenclature.\nThe 1979 IUPAC nomenclature rules made an exception for retaining the non-systematic name \"ethylene\"; however, this decision was reversed in the 1993 rules, and it remains unchanged in the newest 2013 recommendations, so the IUPAC name is now \"ethene\". Note that in the IUPAC system, the name \"ethylene\" is reserved for the divalent group -CH2CH2-. Hence, names like \"ethylene oxide\" and \"ethylene dibromide\" are permitted, but the use of the name \"ethylene\" for the two-carbon alkene is not. Nevertheless, use of the name \"ethylene\" for H2C=CH2 is still prevalent among chemists in North America.\nSafety.\nLike all hydrocarbons, ethylene is a combustible asphyxiant. It is listed as an IARC class 3 carcinogen, since there is no current evidence that it causes cancer in humans."}
{"id": "9838", "revid": "9021902", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9838", "title": "Eiffel (programming language)", "text": "Eiffel is an object-oriented programming language designed by Bertrand Meyer (an object-orientation proponent and author of \"Object-Oriented Software Construction\") and Eiffel Software. Meyer conceived the language in 1985 with the goal of increasing the reliability of commercial software development; the first version becoming available in 1986. In 2005, Eiffel became an ISO-standardized language.\nThe design of the language is closely connected with the Eiffel programming method. Both are based on a set of principles, including design by contract, command\u2013query separation, the uniform-access principle, the single-choice principle, the open\u2013closed principle, and option\u2013operand separation.\nMany concepts initially introduced by Eiffel later found their way into Java, C#, and other languages. New language design ideas, particularly through the Ecma/ISO standardization process, continue to be incorporated into the Eiffel language.\nCharacteristics.\nThe key characteristics of the Eiffel language include:\nDesign goals.\nEiffel emphasizes declarative statements over procedural code and attempts to eliminate the need for bookkeeping instructions.\nEiffel shuns coding tricks or coding techniques intended as optimization hints to the compiler. The aim is not only to make the code more readable, but also to allow programmers to concentrate on the important aspects of a program without getting bogged down in implementation details. Eiffel's simplicity is intended to promote simple, extensible, reusable, and reliable answers to computing problems. Compilers for computer programs written in Eiffel provide extensive optimization techniques, such as automatic in-lining, that relieve the programmer of part of the optimization burden.\nBackground.\nEiffel was originally developed by Eiffel Software, a company founded by Bertrand Meyer. \"Object-Oriented Software Construction\" contains a detailed treatment of the concepts and theory of the object technology that led to Eiffel's design.\nThe design goal behind the Eiffel language, libraries, and programming methods is to enable programmers to create reliable, reusable software modules. Eiffel supports multiple inheritance, genericity, polymorphism, encapsulation, type-safe conversions, and parameter covariance. Eiffel's most important contribution to software engineering is design by contract (DbC), in which assertions, preconditions, postconditions, and class invariants are employed to help ensure program correctness without sacrificing efficiency.\nEiffel's design is based on object-oriented programming theory, with only minor influence of other paradigms or concern for support of legacy code. Eiffel formally supports abstract data types. Under Eiffel's design, a software text should be able to reproduce its design documentation from the text itself, using a formalized implementation of the \"Abstract Data Type\".\nImplementations and environments.\nEiffelStudio is an integrated development environment available under either an open source or a commercial license. It offers an object-oriented environment for software engineering. EiffelEnvision is a plug-in for Microsoft Visual Studio that allows users to edit, compile, and debug Eiffel projects from within the Microsoft Visual Studio IDE. Five other open source implementations are available: \"The Eiffel Compiler\" tecomp; Gobo Eiffel; SmartEiffel, the GNU implementation, based on an older version of the language; LibertyEiffel, based on the SmartEiffel compiler; and Visual Eiffel.\nSeveral other programming languages incorporate elements first introduced in Eiffel. Sather, for example, was originally based on Eiffel but has since diverged, and now includes several functional programming features. The interactive-teaching language Blue, forerunner of BlueJ, is also Eiffel-based. The Apple Media Tool includes an Eiffel-based Apple Media Language.\nSpecifications and standards.\nThe Eiffel language definition is an international standard of the ISO. The standard was developed by ECMA International, which first approved the standard on 21 June 2005 as Standard ECMA-367, Eiffel: Analysis, Design and Programming Language. In June 2006, ECMA and ISO adopted the second version. In November 2006, ISO first published that version. The standard can be found and used free of charge on the ECMA site. The ISO version is identical in all respects except formatting.\nEiffel Software, \"The Eiffel Compiler\" tecomp and Eiffel-library-developer Gobo have committed to implementing the standard; Eiffel Software's EiffelStudio 6.1 and \"The Eiffel Compiler\" tecomp implement some of the major new mechanisms\u2014in particular, inline agents, assigner commands, bracket notation, non-conforming inheritance, and attached types. The SmartEiffel team has turned away from this standard to create its own version of the language, which they believe to be closer to the original style of Eiffel. Object Tools has not disclosed whether future versions of its Eiffel compiler will comply with the standard. LibertyEiffel implements a dialect somewhere in between the SmartEiffel language and the standard.\nThe standard cites the following, predecessor Eiffel-language specifications:\nThe current version of the standard from June 2006 contains some inconsistencies (e.g. covariant redefinitions). The ECMA committee has not yet announced any timeline and direction on how to resolve the inconsistencies.\nSyntax and semantics.\nOverall structure.\nAn Eiffel \"system\" or \"program\" is a collection of \"classes\". Above the level of classes, Eiffel defines \"cluster\", which is essentially a group of classes, and possibly of \"subclusters\" (nested clusters). Clusters are not a syntactic language construct, but rather a standard organizational convention. Typically an Eiffel program will be organized with each class in a separate file, and each cluster in a directory containing class files. In this organization, subclusters are subdirectories. For example, under standard organizational and casing conventions, codice_1 might be the name of a file that defines a class called X.\nA class contains \"features\", which are similar to \"routines\", \"members\", \"attributes\" or \"methods\" in other object-oriented programming languages. A class also defines its invariants, and contains other properties, such as a \"notes\" section for documentation and metadata. Eiffel's standard data types, such as codice_2, codice_3 and codice_4, are all themselves classes.\nEvery system must have a class designated as \"root\", with one of its creation procedures designated as \"root procedure\". Executing a system consists of creating an instance of the root class and executing its root procedure. Generally, doing so creates new objects, calls new features, and so on.\nEiffel has five basic executable instructions: assignment, object creation, routine call, condition, and iteration. Eiffel's control structures are strict in enforcing structured programming: every block has exactly one entry and exactly one exit.\nScoping.\nUnlike many object-oriented languages, but like Smalltalk, Eiffel does not permit any assignment into attributes of objects, except within the features of an object, which is the practical application of the principle of information hiding or data abstraction, requiring formal interfaces for data mutation. To put it in the language of other object-oriented programming languages, all Eiffel attributes are \"protected\", and \"setters\" are needed for client objects to modify values. An upshot of this is that \"setters\" can, and normally do, implement the invariants for which Eiffel provides syntax.\nWhile Eiffel does not allow direct access to the features of a class by a client of the class, it does allow for the definition of an \"assigner command\", such as:\n some_attribute: SOME_TYPE assign set_some_attribute\n set_some_attribute (v: VALUE_TYPE)\n -- Set value of some_attribute to `v'.\n do\n some_attribute := v\n end\nWhile a slight bow to the overall developer community to allow something looking like direct access (e.g. thereby breaking the Information Hiding Principle), the practice is dangerous as it hides or obfuscates the reality of a \"setter\" being used. In practice, it is better to redirect the call to a setter rather than implying a direct access to a feature like codice_5 as in the example code above.\nUnlike other languages, having notions of \"public\", \"protected\", \"private\" and so on, Eiffel uses an exporting technology to more precisely control the scoping between client and supplier classes. Feature visibility is checked statically at compile-time. For example, (below), the \"{NONE}\" is similar to \"protected\" in other languages. Scope applied this way to a \"feature set\" (e.g. everything below the 'feature' keyword to either the next feature set keyword or the end of the class) can be changed in descendant classes using the \"export\" keyword.\nfeature {NONE} -- Initialization\n default_create\n -- Initialize a new `zero' decimal instance.\n do\n make_zero\n end\nAlternatively, the lack of a {x} export declaration implies {ANY} and is similar to the \"public\" scoping of other languages.\nfeature -- Constants\nFinally, scoping can be selectively and precisely controlled to any class in the Eiffel project universe, such as:\nfeature {DECIMAL, DCM_MA_DECIMAL_PARSER, DCM_MA_DECIMAL_HANDLER} -- Access\nHere, the compiler will allow only the classes listed between the curly braces to access the features within the feature group (e.g. ).\n\"Hello, world!\".\nA programming language's look and feel is often conveyed using a \"Hello, world!\" program. Such a program written in Eiffel might be:\nclass\n HELLO_WORLD\ncreate\n make\nfeature\n make\n do\n print (\"Hello, world!%N\")\n end\nend \nThis program contains the class codice_6. The constructor (create routine) for the class, named codice_7, invokes the codice_8 system library routine to write a codice_9\u00a0codice_10 message to the output.\nDesign by contract.\nThe concept of Design by Contract is central to Eiffel. The contracts assert what must be true before a routine is executed (precondition) and what must hold to be true after the routine finishes (post-condition). Class Invariant contracts define what assertions must hold true both before and after any feature of a class is accessed (both routines and attributes). Moreover, contracts codify into executable code developer and designers assumptions about the operating environment of the features of a class or the class as a whole by means of the invariant.\nThe Eiffel compiler is designed to include the feature and class contracts in various levels. EiffelStudio, for example, executes all feature and class contracts during execution in the \"Workbench mode.\" When an executable is created, the compiler is instructed by way of the project settings file (e.g. ECF file) to either include or exclude any set of contracts. Thus, an executable file can be compiled to either include or exclude any level of contract, thereby bringing along continuous levels of unit and integration testing. Moreover, contracts can be continually and methodically exercised by way of the Auto-Test feature found in EiffelStudio.\nThe Design by Contract mechanisms are tightly integrated with the language and guide redefinition of features in inheritance:\nIn addition, the language supports a \"check instruction\" (a kind of \"assert\"), loop invariants, and loop variants (which guarantee loop termination).\nVoid-safe capability.\nVoid-safe capability, like static typing, is another facility for improving software quality. Void-safe software is protected from run time errors caused by calls to void references, and therefore will be more reliable than software in which calls to void targets can occur. The analogy to static typing is a useful one. In fact, void-safe capability could be seen as an extension to the type system, or a step beyond static typing, because the mechanism for ensuring void safety is integrated into the type system.\nThe guard against void target calls can be seen by way of the notion of attachment and (by extension) detachment (e.g. detachable keyword). The void-safe facility can be seen in a short re-work of the example code used above:\n some_attribute: detachable SOME_TYPE\n use_some_attribute\n -- Set value of some_attribute to `v'.\n do\n if attached some_attribute as l_attribute then\n do_something (l_attribute)\n end\n end\n do_something (a_value: SOME_TYPE)\n -- Do something with `a_value'.\n do\n ... doing something with `a_value' ...\n end\nThe code example above shows how the compiler can statically address the reliability of whether codice_5 will be attached or detached at the point it is used. Notably, the codice_12 keyword allows for an \"attachment local\" (e.g. codice_13), which is scoped to only the block of code enclosed by the if-statement construct. Thus, within this small block of code, the local variable (e.g. codice_13) can be statically guaranteed to be non-void (i.e. void safe).\nFeatures: commands and queries.\nThe primary characteristic of a class is that it defines a set of features: as a class represents a set of run-time objects, or \"instances\", a feature is an operation on these objects. There are two kinds of features: queries and commands. A query provides information about an instance. A command modifies an instance.\nThe command-query distinction is important to the Eiffel method. In particular:\nOverloading.\nEiffel does not allow argument overloading. Each feature name within a class always maps to a specific feature within the class. One name, within one class, means one thing. This design choice helps the readability of classes, by avoiding a cause of ambiguity about which routine will be invoked by a call. It also simplifies the language mechanism; in particular, this is what makes Eiffel's multiple inheritance mechanism possible.\nNames can, of course, be reused in different classes. For example, the feature (along with its infix alias ) is defined in several classes: , , , etc.\nGenericity.\nA generic class is a class that varies by type (e.g. LIST [PHONE], a list of phone numbers; ACCOUNT [G-&gt;ACCOUNT_TYPE], allowing for ACCOUNT [SAVINGS] and ACCOUNT [CHECKING], etc.). Classes can be generic, to express that they are parameterized by types. Generic parameters appear in square brackets:\nclass LIST [G] ...\nG is known as a \"formal generic parameter\". (Eiffel reserves \"argument\" for routines, and uses \"parameter\" only for generic classes.) With such a declaration G represents within the class an arbitrary type; so a function can return a value of type G, and a routine can take an argument of that type:\nitem: G do ... end\nput (x: G) do ... end\nThe codice_17 and codice_18 are \"generic derivations\" of this class. Permitted combinations (with codice_19, codice_20, codice_21, codice_22) are:\nn := il.item\nwl.put (w)\ncodice_2 and codice_24 are the \"actual generic parameters\" in these generic derivations.\nIt is also possible to have 'constrained' formal parameters, for which the actual parameter must inherit from a given class, the \"constraint\". For example, in\n class HASH_TABLE [G, KEY -&gt; HASHABLE]\na derivation codice_25 is valid only if codice_3 inherits from codice_27 (as it indeed does in typical Eiffel libraries). Within the class, having codice_28 constrained by codice_27 means that for codice_30 it is possible to apply to codice_31 all the features of codice_27, as in codice_33.\nInheritance basics.\nTo inherit from one or more others, a class will include an codice_34 clause at the beginning:\nclass C inherit\n A\n B\n-- ... Rest of class declaration ...\nThe class may redefine (override) some or all of the inherited features. This must be explicitly announced at the beginning of the class through a codice_35 subclause of the inheritance clause, as in\nclass C inherit\n A\n redefine f, g, h end\n B\n redefine u, v end\nSee for a complete discussion of Eiffel inheritance.\nDeferred classes and features.\nClasses may be defined with codice_36 rather than with codice_37 to indicate that the class may not be directly instantiated. Non-instantiatable classes are called abstract classes in some other object-oriented programming languages. In Eiffel parlance, only an \"effective\" class can be instantiated (it may be a descendant of a deferred class). A feature can also be deferred by using the codice_38 keyword in place of a codice_39 clause. If a class has any deferred features it must be declared as deferred; however, a class with no deferred features may nonetheless itself be deferred.\nDeferred classes play some of the same role as interfaces in languages such as Java, though many object-oriented programming theorists believe interfaces are themselves largely an answer to Java's lack of multiple inheritance (which Eiffel has).\nRenaming.\nA class that inherits from one or more others gets all its features, by default under their original names. It may, however, change their names through codice_40 clauses. This is required in the case of multiple inheritance if there are name clashes between inherited features; without renaming, the resulting class would violate the no-overloading principle noted above and hence would be invalid.\nTuples.\nTuples types may be viewed as a simple form of class, providing only attributes and the corresponding \"setter\" procedure. A typical tuple type reads\n TUPLE [name: STRING; weight: REAL; date: DATE]\nand could be used to describe a simple notion of birth record if a class is not needed. An instance of such a tuple is simply a sequence of values with the given types, given in brackets, such as\n [\"Brigitte\", 3.5, Last_night]\nComponents of such a tuple can be accessed as if the tuple tags were attributes of a class, for example if codice_41 has been assigned the above tuple then codice_42 has value 3.5.\nThanks to the notion of assigner command (see below), dot notation can also be used to assign components of such a tuple, as in\n t.weight := t.weight + 0.5\nThe tuple tags are optional, so that it is also possible to write a tuple type as codice_43. (In some compilers this is the only form of tuple, as tags were introduced with the ECMA standard.)\nThe precise specification of e.g. codice_44 is that it describes sequences of \"at least\" three elements, the first three being of types codice_45, codice_46, codice_47 respectively. As a result, codice_44 conforms to (may be assigned to) codice_49, to codice_50 and to codice_51 (without parameters), the topmost tuple type to which all tuple types conform.\nAgents.\nEiffel's \"agent\" mechanism wraps operations into objects. This mechanism can be used for iteration, event-driven programming, and other contexts in which it is useful to pass operations around the program structure. Other programming languages, especially ones that emphasize functional programming, allow a similar pattern using continuations, closures, or generators; Eiffel's agents emphasize the language's object-oriented paradigm, and use a syntax and semantics similar to code blocks in Smalltalk and Ruby.\nFor example, to execute the codice_52 block for each element of codice_53, one would write:\n my_list.do_all (agent my_action)\nTo execute codice_52 only on elements satisfying codice_55, a limitation/filter can be added:\n my_list.do_if (agent my_action, agent my_condition)\nIn these examples, codice_52 and codice_55 are routines. Prefixing them with codice_58 yields an object that represents the corresponding routine with all its properties, in particular the ability to be called with the appropriate arguments. So if codice_59 represents that object (for example because codice_59 is the argument to codice_61), the instruction\n a.call ([x])\nwill call the original routine with the argument codice_31, as if we had directly called the original routine: codice_63. Arguments to codice_64 are passed as a tuple, here codice_65.\nIt is possible to keep some arguments to an agent open and make others closed. The open arguments are passed as arguments to codice_64: they are provided at the time of \"agent use\". The closed arguments are provided at the time of agent \"definition\". For example, if codice_67 has two arguments, the iteration\n my_list.do_all (agent action2 (?, y))\niterates codice_68 for successive values of codice_31, where the second argument remains set to codice_70. The question mark codice_71 indicates an open argument; codice_70 is a closed argument of the agent. Note that the basic syntax codice_73 is a shorthand for codice_74 with all arguments open. It is also possible to make the \"target\" of an agent open through the notation codice_75 where codice_76 is the type of the target.\nThe distinction between open and closed operands (operands = arguments + target) corresponds to the distinction between bound and free variables in lambda calculus. An agent expression such as codice_77 with some operands closed and some open corresponds to a version of the original operation \"curried\" on the closed operands.\nThe agent mechanism also allows defining an agent without reference to an existing routine (such as codice_52, codice_55, codice_67), through inline agents as in\nmy_list.do_all (agent (s: STRING)\n require\n not_void: s /= Void\n do\n s.append_character (',')\n ensure\n appended: s.count = old s.count + 1\n end)\nThe inline agent passed here can have all the trappings of a normal routine, including precondition, postcondition, rescue clause (not used here), and a full signature. This avoids defining routines when all that's needed is a computation to be wrapped in an agent. This is useful in particular for contracts, as in an invariant clause that expresses that all elements of a list are positive:\n my_list.for_all (agent (x: INTEGER): BOOLEAN do Result := (x &gt; 0) end)\nThe current agent mechanism leaves a possibility of run-time type error (if a routine with \"n\" arguments is passed to an agent expecting \"m\" arguments with \"m\" &lt; \"n\"). This can be avoided by a run-time check through the precondition codice_81 of codice_64. Several proposals for a purely static correction of this problem are available, including a language change proposal by Ribet et al.\nOnce routines.\nA routine's result can be cached using the codice_83 keyword in place of codice_39. Non-first calls to a routine require no additional computation or resource allocation, but simply return a previously computed result. A common pattern for \"once functions\" is to provide shared objects; the first call will create the object, subsequent ones will return the reference to that object. The typical scheme is:\nshared_object: SOME_TYPE\n once\n create Result.make (args)\n -- This creates the object and returns a reference to it through `Result'.\n end\nThe returned object\u2014codice_85 in the example\u2014can itself be mutable, but its reference remains the same.\nOften \"once routines\" perform a required initialization: multiple calls to a library can include a call to the initialization procedure, but only the first such call will perform the required actions. Using this pattern initialization can be decentralized, avoiding the need for a special initialization module. \"Once routines\" are similar in purpose and effect to the singleton pattern in many programming languages, and to the used in Python.\nBy default, a \"once routine\" is called \"once per thread\". The semantics can be adjusted to \"once per process\" or \"once per object\" by qualifying it with a \"once key\", e.g. codice_86.\nConversions.\nEiffel provides a mechanism to allow conversions between various types. The mechanisms coexists with inheritance and complements it. To avoid any confusion between the two mechanisms, the design enforces the following principle:\nFor example, codice_87 may conform to codice_88, but codice_2 converts to codice_90 (and does not inherit from it).\nThe conversion mechanism simply generalizes the ad hoc conversion rules (such as indeed between codice_2 and codice_90) that exist in most programming languages, making them applicable to any type as long as the above principle is observed. For example, a codice_93 class may be declared to convert to codice_3; this makes it possible to create a string from a date simply through\n my_string := my_date\nas a shortcut for using an explicit object creation with a conversion procedure:\n create my_string.make_from_date (my_date)\nTo make the first form possible as a synonym for the second, it suffices to list the creation procedure (constructor) codice_95 in a codice_96 clause at the beginning of the class.\nAs another example, if there is such a conversion procedure listed from codice_97, then one can directly assign a tuple to a date, causing the appropriate conversion, as in\n Bastille_day := [14, \"July\", 1789]\nException handling.\nException handling in Eiffel is based on the principles of design by contract. For example, an exception occurs when a routine's caller fails to satisfy a precondition, or when a routine cannot ensure a promised postcondition. In Eiffel, exception handling is not used for control flow or to correct data-input mistakes.\nAn Eiffel exception handler is defined using the keyword. Within the section, the keyword executes the routine again. For example, the following routine tracks the number of attempts at executing the routine, and only retries a certain number of times:\nconnect_to_server (server: SOCKET)\n -- Connect to a server or give up after 10 attempts.\n require\n server /= Void and then server.address /= Void\n local\n attempts: INTEGER\n do\n server.connect\n ensure\n connected: server.is_connected\n rescue\n if attempts &lt; 10 then\n attempts := attempts + 1\n retry\n end\n end\nThis example is arguably flawed for anything but the simplest programs, however, because connection failure is to be expected. For most programs a routine name like would be better, and the postcondition would not promise a connection, leaving it up to the caller to take appropriate steps if the connection was not opened.\nConcurrency.\nA number of networking and threading libraries are available, such as EiffelNet and EiffelThreads. A concurrency model for Eiffel, based on the concepts of design by contract, is SCOOP, or \"Simple Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming\", not yet part of the official language definition but available in EiffelStudio. CAMEO is an (unimplemented) variation of SCOOP for Eiffel. Concurrency also interacts with exceptions. Asynchronous exceptions can be troublesome (where a routine raises an exception after its caller has itself finished).\nOperator and bracket syntax, assigner commands.\nEiffel's view of computation is completely object-oriented in the sense that every operation is relative to an object, the \"target\". So for example an addition such as\na + b\nis conceptually understood as if it were the method call\na.plus (b)\nwith target codice_59, feature codice_99 and argument codice_100.\nOf course, the former is the conventional syntax and usually preferred. Operator syntax makes it possible to use either form by declaring the feature (for example in codice_2, but this applies to other basic classes and can be used in any other for which such an operator is appropriate):\nplus alias \"+\" (other: INTEGER): INTEGER\n -- ... Normal function declaration...\n end\nThe range of operators that can be used as \"alias\" is quite broad; they include predefined operators such as \"+\" but also \"free operators\" made of non-alphanumeric symbols. This makes it possible to design special infix and prefix notations, for example in mathematics and physics applications.\nEvery class may in addition have \"one\" function aliased to \"[]\", the \"bracket\" operator, allowing the notation codice_102 as a synonym for codice_103 where codice_104 is the chosen function. This is particularly useful for container structures such as arrays, hash tables, lists etc. For example, access to an element of a hash table with string keys can be written\n number := phone_book [\"JILL SMITH\"]\n\"Assigner commands\" are a companion mechanism designed in the same spirit of allowing well-established, convenient notation reinterpreted in the framework of object-oriented programming. Assigner commands allow assignment-like syntax to call \"setter\" procedures. An assignment proper can never be of the form codice_105 as this violates information hiding; you have to go for a setter command (procedure). For example, the hash table class can have the function and the procedure\nitem alias \"[]\" (key: STRING): ELEMENT [3]\n -- The element of key `key'.\n -- (\"Getter\" query)\n do\n end\nput (e: ELEMENT; key: STRING)\n -- Insert the element `e', associating it with the key `key'.\n -- (\"Setter\" command)\n do\n end\nThen to insert an element you have to use an explicit call to the setter command:\n [4] phone_book.put (New_person, \"JILL SMITH\")\nIt is possible to write this equivalently as\n [5] phone_book [\"JILL SMITH\"] := New_person\n(in the same way that codice_106 is a synonym for codice_107), provided the declaration of codice_108 now starts (replacement for [3]) with\n item alias \"[]\" (key: STRING): ELEMENT assign put\nThis declares codice_109 as the assigner command associated with codice_108 and, combined with the bracket alias, makes [5] legal and equivalent to [4]. (It could also be written, without taking advantage of the bracket, as codice_111.\nNote: The argument list of a's assigner is constrained to be: (a's return type;all of a's argument list...)\nLexical and syntax properties.\nEiffel is not case-sensitive. The tokens codice_7, codice_113 and codice_114 all denote the same identifier. See, however, the \"style rules\" below.\nComments are introduced by codice_115 (two consecutive dashes) and extend to the end of the line.\nThe semicolon, as instruction separator, is optional. Most of the time the semicolon is just omitted, except to separate multiple instructions on a line. This results in less clutter on the program page.\nThere is no nesting of feature and class declarations. As a result, the structure of an Eiffel class is simple: some class-level clauses (inheritance, invariant) and a succession of feature declarations, all at the same level.\nIt is customary to group features into separate \"feature clauses\" for more readability, with a standard set of basic feature tags appearing in a standard order, for example:\nclass HASH_TABLE [ELEMENT, KEY -&gt; HASHABLE] inherit TABLE [ELEMENT]\n feature -- Initialization\n -- ... Declarations of initialization commands (creation procedures/constructors) ...\n feature -- Access\n -- ... Declarations of non-boolean queries on the object state, e.g. item ...\n feature -- Status report\n -- ... Declarations of boolean queries on the object state, e.g. is_empty ...\n feature -- Element change\n -- ... Declarations of commands that change the structure, e.g. put ...\n -- etc.\nend\nIn contrast to most curly bracket programming languages, Eiffel makes a clear distinction between expressions and instructions. This is in line with the Command-Query Separation principle of the Eiffel method.\nStyle conventions.\nMuch of the documentation of Eiffel uses distinctive style conventions, designed to enforce a consistent look-and-feel. Some of these conventions apply to the code format itself, and others to the standard typographic rendering of Eiffel code in formats and publications where these conventions are possible.\nWhile the language is case-insensitive, the style standards prescribe the use of all-capitals for class names (codice_116), all-lower-case for feature names (codice_7), and initial capitals for constants (codice_118). The recommended style also suggests underscore to separate components of a multi-word identifier, as in codice_119.\nThe specification of Eiffel includes guidelines for displaying software texts in typeset formats: keywords in bold, user-defined identifiers and constants are shown in \"codice_120\", comments, operators, and punctuation marks in codice_121, with program text in codice_122 as in the present article to distinguish it from explanatory text. For example, the \"Hello, world!\" program given above would be rendered as below in Eiffel documentation:\nclass\n HELLO_WORLD\ncreate\n make\nfeature\n make\n do\n print (\"Hello, world!\")\n end\nend\nInterfaces to other tools and languages.\nEiffel is a purely object-oriented language but provides an open architecture for interfacing with \"external\" software in any other programming language.\nIt is possible for example to program machine- and operating-system level operations in C. Eiffel provides a straightforward interface to C routines, including support for \"inline C\" (writing the body of an Eiffel routine in C, typically for short machine-level operations).\nAlthough there is no direct connection between Eiffel and C, many Eiffel compilers (Visual Eiffel is one exception) output C source code as an intermediate language, to submit to a C compiler, for optimizing and portability. As such, they are examples of transcompilers.

{"id": "9839", "revid": "209266", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9839", "title": "Ezra", "text": "Ezra (; , '; fl. 480\u2013440 BCE), also called Ezra the Scribe (, ') and Ezra the Priest in the Book of Ezra, was a Jewish scribe (\"sofer\") and priest (\"kohen\"). In Greco-Latin Ezra is called Esdras (). According to the Hebrew Bible he was a descendant of Sraya the last High Priest to serve in the First Temple, and a close relative of Joshua the first High Priest of the Second Temple He returned from Babylonian exile and reintroduced the Torah in Jerusalem. According to 1 Esdras, a Greek translation of the Book of Ezra still in use in Eastern Orthodoxy, he was also a High Priest. Rabbinic tradition holds that he was an ordinary member of the priesthood.\nSeveral traditions have developed over his place of burial. One tradition says that he is buried in al-Uzayr near Basra (Iraq), while another tradition alleges that he is buried in Tadif near Aleppo, in northern Syria.\nHis name may be an abbreviation of ', \"Yah helps\". In the Greek Septuagint the name is rendered ' (), from which the Latin name comes.\nThe Book of Ezra describes how he led a group of Judean exiles living in Babylon to their home city of Jerusalem where he is said to have enforced observance of the Torah. He was described as exhorting the Israelite people to be sure to follow the Torah Law so as not to intermarry with people of particular different religions, a set of commandments described in the Pentateuch.\nEzra, known as \"Ezra the scribe\" in Chazalic literature, is a highly respected figure in Judaism.\nIn the Hebrew Bible.\nThe canonical Book of Ezra and Book of Nehemiah are the oldest sources for the activity of Ezra, whereas many of the other books ascribed to Ezra (First Esdras, 3\u20136 Ezra) are later literary works dependent on the canonical books of Ezra and Nehemiah.\nThe book of Ezra\u2013Nehemiah was always written as one scroll. In late medieval Christian bibles, the single book was divided in two, as First and Second Ezra; and this division became Jewish practice in the first printed Hebrew bibles. Modern Hebrew Bibles call the two books Ezra and Nehemiah, as do other modern Bible translations. A few parts of the Book of Ezra (4:8 to 6:18 and 7:12\u201326) were written in Aramaic, and the majority in Hebrew, Ezra himself being skilled in both languages. Ezra was living in Babylon when in the seventh year of Artaxerxes I, king of Persia (c. 457 BCE), the king sent him to Jerusalem to teach the laws of God to any who did not know them. Ezra led a large body of exiles back to Jerusalem, where he discovered that Jewish men had been marrying non-Jewish women. He tore his garments in despair and confessed the sins of Israel before God, then braved the opposition of some of his own countrymen to purify the community by enforcing the dissolution of the sinful marriages. Some years later Artaxerxes sent Nehemiah (a Jewish noble in his personal service) to Jerusalem as governor with the task of rebuilding the city walls. Once this task was completed Nehemiah had Ezra read the Law of Moses (the Torah) to the assembled Israelites, and the people and priests entered into a covenant to keep the law and separate themselves from all other peoples.\nIn later Second Temple period literature.\n1 Esdras.\n1 Esdras, probably from the late 2nd/early 1st centuries BCE, preserves a Greek text of Ezra and a part of Nehemiah distinctly different from that of Ezra\u2013Nehemiah \u2013 in particular it eliminates Nehemiah from the story and gives some of his deeds to Ezra, as well as telling events in a different order. Scholars are divided on whether it is based on Ezra\u2013Nehemiah, or reflects an earlier literary stage before the combination of Ezra and Nehemiah accounts.\nJosephus.\nThe first-century Jewish historian Josephus deals with Ezra in his \"Antiquities of the Jews\". He uses the name Xerxes for Artaxerxes I reserving the name Artaxerxes for the later Artaxerxes II whom he identifies as the Ahasuerus of Esther, thus placing Ezra before the events of the book of Esther. Josephus's account of the deeds of Ezra derives entirely from 1 Esdras, which he cites as the 'Book of Ezra' in his numeration of the Hebrew bible. Contrariwise, Josephus does not appear to recognise Ezra-Nehemiah as a biblical book, does not quote from it, and relies entirely on other traditions in his account of the deeds of Nehemiah.\nThe apocalyptic Ezra traditions.\nThe apocalyptic fourth book of Ezra (also sometimes called the 'second book of Esdras' or the 'third book of Esdras') was written c. CE 100, probably in Hebrew-Aramaic, but now survives in Latin, Slavonic and Ethiopic. In this book, Ezra has a seven part prophetic revelation, converses with an angel of God three times and has four visions. Ezra, thirty years into the Babylonian Exile (4 Ezra 3:1 / 2 Esdras 1:1), recounts the siege of Jerusalem and the destruction of Solomon's Temple. The central theological themes are \"the question of theodicy, God's justness in the face of the triumph of the heathens over the pious, the course of world history in terms of the teaching of the four kingdoms, the function of the law, the eschatological judgment, the appearance on Earth of the heavenly Jerusalem, the Messianic Period, at the end of which the Messiah will die, the end of this world and the coming of the next, and the Last Judgment.\" Ezra restores the law that was destroyed with the burning of the Temple in Jerusalem. He dictates 24 books for the public (i.e. the Hebrew Bible) and another 70 for the wise alone (70 unnamed revelatory works). At the end, he is taken up to heaven like Enoch and Elijah. Ezra is seen as a new Moses in this book.\nThere is also another work, thought to be influenced by this one, known as the \"Greek Apocalypse of Ezra\".\nEzra in rabbinic literature.\nTraditionally Judaism credits Ezra with establishing the Great Assembly of scholars and prophets, the forerunner of the Sanhedrin, as the authority on matters of religious law. The Great Assembly is credited with establishing numerous features of contemporary traditional Judaism in something like their present form, including Torah reading, the Amidah, and celebration of the feast of Purim.\nIn Rabbinic traditions, Ezra is metaphorically referred to as the \"flowers that appear on the earth\" signifying the springtime in the national history of Judaism . A disciple of Baruch ben Neriah, he favored study of the Law over the reconstruction of the Temple and thus because of his studies, he did not join the first party returning to Jerusalem in the reign of Cyrus. According to another opinion, he did not join the first party so as not to compete, even involuntarily, with Jeshua ben Jozadak for the office of chief priest.\nAccording to Jewish tradition, Ezra was the writer of the Books of Chronicles, and is the same prophet known also as Malachi. There is a slight controversy within rabbinic sources as to whether or not Ezra had served as Kohen Gadol.\nAccording to the Babylonian Talmud, Ezra the scribe is said to have enacted ten standing laws and orders, which are as follows: 1) That the public come together to read from the scroll of the Law on Sabbath days during the time of the afternoon oblation (Minchah), because of those travelling merchants who loiter in the closed shops in the street corners, and who may have missed the biblical lections that were read during the weekdays; 2) that the courts be opened throughout the Jewish townships on Mondays and Thursdays; 3) that women do not wait beyond Thursday to launder their clothes, because of the honor due to the Sabbath day; 4) that men would accustom themselves to eat [cooked] garlic on the eve of the Sabbath (believed to enhance love between a man and his wife); 5) that women would rise up early on Friday mornings to bake bread, so that a piece of bread will be available for the poor; 6) that Jewish women in every place be girded with a wide belt (waist band), whether from the front or from behind, out of modesty; 7) that Jewish women, during their menses, wash and comb their hair three days prior to their purification in a ritual bath; 8) that the travelling merchants make regular rounds into the Jewish townships because of the honor due to the daughters of Israel; 9) that Jewish women and/or girls, as a precautionary measure, be accustomed to conversing with one another while one of their party goes out to relieve herself in the outhouse; 10) that men who may have suffered a seminal emission (especially after accompanying with their wives) be required to immerse themselves in a ritual bath before being permitted to read from the scroll of the Law.\nIn the Syrian village of Tedef, a synagogue said to be the place where Ezra stopped over has been venerated by Jews for centuries. Another tradition locates his tomb near Basra, Iraq.\nEzra in Christian traditions.\nEarly Christian writers occasionally cited Ezra as author of the apocalyptic books attributed to him. Clement of Alexandria in his \"Stromata\" referred to Ezra as an example of prophetic inspiration, quoting a section from 2 Esdras. Where early Christian writers refer to the 'Book of Ezra' it is always the text of 1 Esdras that is being cited. No early Christian writer cites the Book of Ezra as a record of the deeds of Ezra.\nEzra in Islam.\nIn Islam he is known as Uzair (). He was mentioned in the Qur'an. Although he was not mentioned as one of the Prophets of Islam, he is considered as one of them by some Muslim scholars, based on Islamic traditions. His tomb at Al-\u02bbUzair on the banks of the Tigris near Basra, Iraq, is a pilgrimage site for the local Marsh Arabs. Many Islamic scholars and modern Western academics do not view Uzair as \"Ezra\"; for example Professor Gordon Darnell Newby associates Uzair with Enoch and Metatron. On this Timothy Winter (Abdal Hakim Murad) and Gordon Darnell Newby associate Uzair again with Enoch (ancestor of Noah) and by extension Metatron the creator-angel.\nAcademic view.\nTimeline.\nScholars are divided over the chronological sequence of the activities of Ezra and Nehemiah. Ezra came to Jerusalem \"in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the King\". The text does not specify whether the king in the passage refers to Artaxerxes I (465\u2013424 BCE) or to Artaxerxes II (404\u2013359 BCE). Most scholars hold that Ezra lived during the rule of Artaxerxes I, though some have difficulties with this assumption: Nehemiah and Ezra \"seem to have no knowledge of each other; their missions do not overlap\", however, in Nehemiah 12, both are leading processions on the wall as part of the wall dedication ceremony. So, they clearly were contemporaries working together in Jerusalem at the time the wall and the city of Jerusalem was rebuilt in contrast to the previously stated viewpoint.;.\" These difficulties have led many scholars to assume that Ezra arrived in the seventh year of the rule of Artaxerxes II, i.e. some 50 years after Nehemiah. This assumption would imply that the biblical account is not chronological. The last group of scholars regard \"the seventh year\" as a scribal error and hold that the two men were contemporaries.\nHistoricity.\nMary Joan Winn Leith in \"The Oxford History of the Biblical World\" believes that Ezra was a historical figure whose life was enhanced in the scripture and given a theological buildup. Gosta W. Ahlstrom argues the inconsistencies of the biblical tradition are insufficient to say that Ezra, with his central position as the 'father of Judaism' in the Jewish tradition, has been a later literary invention. Those who argue against the historicity of Ezra argue that the presentation style of Ezra as a leader and lawgiver resembles that of Moses. There are also similarities between Ezra the priest-scribe (but not high priest) and Nehemiah the secular governor on the one hand and Joshua and Zerubbabel on the other hand. The early 2nd-century BCE Jewish author Ben Sira praises Nehemiah, but makes no mention of Ezra.\nRichard Friedman argued in his book \"Who Wrote the Bible?\" that Ezra is the one who redacted the Torah, and in fact effectively produced the first Torah. It has been argued that even if one does not accept the documentary hypothesis, Ezra was instrumental in the start of the process of bringing the Torah together."}
{"id": "9840", "revid": "31616893", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9840", "title": "Elijah", "text": "Elijah ( ; , meaning \"My God is Yahweh/YHWH\") or Greek form Elias ( ) was, according to the Books of Kings in the Hebrew Bible, a prophet and a miracle worker who lived in the northern kingdom of Israel during the reign of King Ahab (9th century BCE). In 1 Kings 18, Elijah defended the worship of the Hebrew God over that of the Canaanite deity Baal. God also performed many miracles through Elijah, including resurrection, bringing fire down from the sky, and entering heaven alive \"by fire\". He is also portrayed as leading a school of prophets known as \"the sons of the prophets\". Following his ascension, Elisha, his disciple and most devoted assistant, took over his role as leader of this school. The Book of Malachi prophesies Elijah's return \"before the coming of the great and terrible day of the \", making him a harbinger of the Messiah and of the eschaton in various faiths that revere the Hebrew Bible. References to Elijah appear in Ecclesiasticus, the New Testament, the Mishnah and Talmud, the Quran, the Book of Mormon, the Doctrine and Covenants, and Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed writings.\nIn Judaism, Elijah's name is invoked at the weekly Havdalah rite that marks the end of Shabbat, and Elijah is invoked in other Jewish customs, among them the Passover Seder and the brit milah (ritual circumcision). He appears in numerous stories and references in the Haggadah and rabbinic literature, including the Babylonian Talmud.\nThe Christian New Testament notes that some people thought that Jesus was, in some sense, Elijah, but it also makes clear that John the Baptist is \"the Elijah\" who was promised to come in ; . According to accounts in all three of the Synoptic Gospels, Elijah appeared with Moses during the Transfiguration of Jesus.\nIn Islam, Elijah or Ilyas appears in the Quran as a prophet and messenger of God, where his biblical narrative of preaching against the worshipers of Baal is recounted in a concise form. Due to his importance to Muslims, Catholics, and Orthodox Christians, Elijah has been venerated as the patron saint of Bosnia and Herzegovina since 1752.\nBiblical accounts.\nAccording to the Bible, by the 9th\u00a0century BCE, the Kingdom of Israel, once united under Solomon, divided into the northern Kingdom of Israel and the southern Kingdom of Judah (which retained the historical capital of Jerusalem along with its Temple). Omri, King of Israel, continued policies dating from the reign of Jeroboam, contrary to religious law, that were intended to reorient religious focus away from Jerusalem: encouraging the building of local temple altars for sacrifices, appointing priests from outside the family of the Levites, and allowing or encouraging temples dedicated to Baal, an important deity in ancient Canaanite religion. Omri achieved domestic security with a marriage alliance between his son Ahab and princess Jezebel, a priestess of Baal and the daughter of the king of Sidon in Phoenicia. These solutions brought security and economic prosperity to Israel for a time, but did not bring peace with the Israelite prophets, who advocated a strict deuteronomic interpretation of the religious law.\nUnder Ahab's kingship tensions exacerbated. Ahab built a temple for Baal, and his wife Jezebel brought a large entourage of priests and prophets of Baal and Asherah into the country. In this context Elijah is introduced in 1 Kings 17:1 as Elijah \"the Tishbite\". He warns Ahab that there will be years of catastrophic drought so severe that not even dew will form, because Ahab and his queen stand at the end of a line of kings of Israel who are said to have \"done evil in the sight of the Lord\".\nBooks of Kings.\nNo background for the person of Elijah is given except for his brief characterization as a Tishbite. His name in Hebrew means \"My God is Yahweh\", and may be a title applied to him because of his challenge to worship of Baal.\nAs told in the Hebrew Bible, Elijah's challenge is bold and direct. Baal was the Canaanite god responsible for rain, thunder, lightning, and dew.\nElijah thus, when he initially announces the drought, not only challenges Baal on behalf of God himself, but he also challenges Jezebel, her priests, Ahab and the people of Israel.\nWidow of Zarephath.\nAfter Elijah's confrontation with Ahab, God tells him to flee out of Israel, to a hiding place by the brook Chorath, east of the Jordan, where he will be fed by ravens. When the brook dries up, God sends him to a widow living in the town of Zarephath in Phoenicia.\nWhen Elijah finds her and asks to be fed, she says that she does not have sufficient food to keep her and her own son alive. Elijah tells her that God will not allow her supply of flour or oil to run out, saying, \"Do not be afraid ... For thus says the Lord the God of Israel: The jar of meal will not be emptied and the jug of oil will not fail until the day that the Lord sends rain on the earth.\" She feeds him the last of their food, and Elijah's promise miraculously comes true. God gave her \"manna\" from heaven even while he was withholding food from his unfaithful people in the promised land.\nSome time later the widow's son dies and the widow cries, \"You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance, and to cause the death of my son!\" Elijah prays that God might restore her son so that the trustworthiness of God's word might be demonstrated, and \"[God] listened to the voice of Elijah; the life of the child came into him again, and he revived.\" This is the first instance of raising the dead recorded in Scripture. This widow was granted the life of her son, the only hope for a widow in ancient society. The widow cried, \"the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth.\"\nAfter more than three years of drought and famine, God tells Elijah to return to Ahab and announce the end of the drought: Not occasioned by repentance in Israel but by the command of the Lord, who had determined to reveal himself again to his people. While on his way, Elijah meets Obadiah, the head of Ahab's household, who had hidden a hundred Jewish prophets from Jezebel's violent purge. Obadiah fears that when he reports to Ahab about Elijah's whereabouts, Elijah would disappear, provoking Ahab to execute him. Elijah reassures Obadiah and sends him to Ahab.\nChallenge to Baal.\nWhen Ahab confronts Elijah, he denounces him as being the \"troubler of Israel\" but Elijah takes notice of his hypocrisy and tells Ahab that he is the one who troubled Israel by allowing the worship of false gods. Elijah then berates both the people of Israel and Ahab for their acquiescence in Baal worship. \"How long will you go limping with two different opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him.\" And the people were silent. The Hebrew for this word, \"go limping\" or \"waver\", is the same as that used for \"danced\" in 1 Kings 18, verse 26, where the prophets of Baal frantically dance. Elijah speaks with sharp irony about the religious ambivalence of Israel.\nElijah proposes a direct test of the powers of Baal and the Jewish God. The people of Israel, 450 prophets of Baal, and 400 prophets of Asherah are summoned to Mount Carmel. An altar is built for Baal. Wood is laid on the altar. An ox is slaughtered and cut into pieces; the pieces are laid on the wood. Elijah then invites the priests of Baal to pray for fire to light the sacrifice. They pray from morning to noon without success. Elijah ridicules their efforts. \"At noon Elijah mocked them, saying, 'Cry aloud! Surely he is a god; either he is meditating, or he has wandered away, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened.'\" They respond by cutting themselves and adding their own blood to the sacrifice (such mutilation of the body was strictly forbidden in the Mosaic law). They continue praying until evening without success.\nElijah builds an altar from twelve stones, digs a huge trench around it, lays wood on it, slaughters another ox, cuts it up, and lays it on the wood. He then orders that the sacrifice and altar be drenched with water from \"four large jars\" poured three times, filling also the trench. He asks God to accept the sacrifice. Fire falls from the sky, consuming the sacrifice, the stones of the altar itself, the earth and the water in the trench as well. Elijah then orders the deaths of the priests of Baal. Elijah prays earnestly for rain to fall again on the land. Then the rains begin, signaling the end of the famine.\nMount Horeb.\nJezebel, enraged that Elijah had ordered the deaths of her priests, threatens to kill Elijah. Later Elijah would prophesy about Jezebel's death, because of her sin. Elijah flees to Beersheba in Judah, continues alone into the wilderness, and finally sits down under a shrub, praying for death. He falls asleep under the tree; the angel of the Lord touches him and tells him to wake up and eat. When he awakens he finds bread and a jar of water. He eats, drinks, and goes back to sleep. The angel comes a second time and tells him to eat and drink because he has a long journey ahead of him.\nElijah travels for forty days and forty nights to Mount Horeb, where Moses had received the Ten Commandments. Elijah is the only person described in the Bible as returning to Horeb, after Moses and his generation had left Horeb several centuries before. He seeks shelter in a cave. God again speaks to Elijah: \"What doest thou here, Elijah?\". Elijah did not give a direct answer to the Lord's question but evades and equivocates, implying that the work the Lord had begun centuries earlier had now come to nothing, and that his own work was fruitless. Unlike Moses, who tried to defend Israel when they sinned with the golden calf, Elijah bitterly complains over the Israelites' unfaithfulness and says he is the \"only one left\". Up until this time Elijah has only the word of God to guide him, but now he is told to go outside the cave and \"stand before the Lord.\" A terrible wind passes, but God is not in the wind. A great earthquake shakes the mountain, but God is not in the earthquake. Then a fire passes the mountain, but God is not in the fire. Then a \"still small voice\" comes to Elijah and asks again, \"What doest thou here, Elijah?\" Elijah again evades the question and his lament is unrevised, showing that he did not understand the importance of the divine revelation he had just witnessed. God then sends him out again, this time to Damascus to anoint Hazael as king of Aram, Jehu as king of Israel, and Elisha as his replacement.\nVineyard of Naboth.\nElijah encounters Ahab again in 1 Kings 21, after Ahab has acquired possession of a vineyard by murder. Ahab desires to have the vineyard of Naboth of Jezreel. He offers a better vineyard or a fair price for the land. But Naboth tells Ahab that God has told him not to part with the land. Ahab accepts this answer with sullen bad grace. Jezebel, however, plots a method for acquiring the land. She sends letters, in Ahab's name, to the elders and nobles who lived near Naboth. They are to arrange a feast and invite Naboth. At the feast, false charges of cursing God and Ahab are to be made against him. The plot is carried out and Naboth is stoned to death. When word comes that Naboth is dead, Jezebel tells Ahab to take possession of the vineyard.\nGod again speaks to Elijah and sends him to confront Ahab with a question and a prophecy: \"Have you killed, and also taken possession?\" and, \"In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth, dogs will also lick up your blood.\" Ahab begins the confrontation by calling Elijah his enemy. Elijah responds by throwing the charge back at him, telling him that he has made himself the enemy of God by his own actions. Elijah then goes beyond the prophecy he was given and tells Ahab that his entire kingdom will reject his authority; that Jezebel will be eaten by dogs within Jezreel; and that his family will be consumed by dogs as well (if they die in a city) or by birds (if they die in the country). When Ahab hears this he repents to such a degree that God relents in punishing Ahab but will punish Jezebel and their son: Ahaziah.\nAhaziah.\nElijah's story continues now from Ahab to an encounter with Ahaziah (2 Kings 1). The scene opens with Ahaziah seriously injured in a fall. He sends to the priests of Baalzebub in Ekron, outside the kingdom of Israel, to know if he will recover. Elijah intercepts his messengers and sends them back to Ahaziah with a message \"Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?\" Ahaziah asks the messengers to describe the person who gave them this message. They tell him he was a hairy man with a leather belt around his waist and he instantly recognizes the description as Elijah the Tishbite.\nAhaziah sends out three groups of soldiers to arrest Elijah. The first two are destroyed by fire which Elijah calls down from heaven. The leader of the third group asks for mercy for himself and his men. Elijah agrees to accompany this third group to Ahaziah, where he gives his prophecy in person. Ahaziah dies without recovering from his injuries in accordance with Elijah's word.\nDeparture.\nAccording to 2 Kings 2:3\u20139, Elisha (Eliseus) and \"the sons of the prophets\" knew beforehand that Elijah would one day be assumed into heaven. Elisha asked Elijah to \"let a double portion\" of Elijah's \"spirit\" be upon him. Elijah agreed, with the condition that Elisha would see him be \"taken\".\nElijah, in company with Elisha, approaches the Jordan. He rolls up his mantle and strikes the water. The water immediately divides and Elijah and Elisha cross on dry land. Suddenly, a chariot of fire and horses of fire appear and Elijah is lifted up in a whirlwind. As Elijah is lifted up, his mantle falls to the ground and Elisha picks it up.\nBooks of Chronicles.\nElijah is mentioned once more in 2 Chronicles 21:12, which will be his final mention in the Hebrew Bible. A letter is sent under the prophet's name to Jehoram of Judah. It tells him that he has led the people of Judah astray in the same way that Israel was led astray. The prophet ends the letter with a prediction of a painful death.\nThis letter is a puzzle to readers for several reasons. First, it concerns a king of the southern kingdom, while Elijah concerned himself with the kingdom of Israel. Second, the message begins with \"Thus says YHVH, God of your father David...\" rather than the more usual \"...in the name of YHVH the God of Israel.\" Also, this letter seems to come after Elijah's ascension into the whirlwind.\nMichael Wilcock, formerly of Trinity College, Bristol, suggests a number of possible reasons for this letter, among them that it may be an example of a better known prophet's name being substituted for that of a lesser known prophet. John Van Seters, however, rejects the letter as having any connection with the Elijah tradition. However, Wilcock argues that Elijah's letter \"does address a very 'northern' situation in the southern kingdom\", and thus is authentic.\nIn Malachi.\nWhile the final mention of Elijah in the Hebrew Bible is in the Book of Chronicles, Christian Bibles' reordering places the Book of Malachi, which prophesies a messiah, as the final book of the Old Testament, before the New Testament gospels. Elijah's final Old Testament appearance is in the Book of Malachi, where it is written, \"Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the great and awesome day of the Lord comes. And he will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and the hearts of children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the land with a decree of utter destruction.\"\nHistoricity.\nThere is a general agreement on the existence of a prophet named Elijah in the Kingdom of Israel during the reign of King Ahab and Queen Jezebel. However, the biblical presentation of the prophet cannot be taken as historical documentation of his activity. His career is presented through the eyes of popular legend and subsequent theological reflection, which consider him a personality of heroic proportions. In this process his actions and relations to the people and the king became stereotyped, and the presentation of his behavior, paradigmatic.\nIn the Aggadah, Talmud, and extra-canonical books.\nJewish legends about Elijah abound in the aggadah, which is found throughout various collections of rabbinic literature, including the Babylonian Talmud. This varied literature does not merely discuss his life, but has created a new history of him, which, beginning with his death or \"translation\" ends only with the close of the history of the human race. The volume of references to Elijah in Jewish Tradition stands in marked contrast to that in the Canon. As in the case of most figures of Jewish legend, so in the case of Elijah, the biblical account became the basis of later legend. Elijah the precursor of the Messiah, Elijah zealous in the cause of God, Elijah the helper in distress: these are the three leading notes struck by the Aggadah, endeavoring to complete the biblical picture with the Elijah legends. His career is extensive, colorful, and varied. He has appeared the world over in the guise of a beggar and scholar.\nFrom the time of Malachi, who says of Elijah that God will send him before \"the great and dreadful day\", down to the later stories of the Chasidic rabbis, reverence and love, expectation and hope, were always connected in the Jewish consciousness with Elijah.\nOrigin.\nThree different theories regarding Elijah's origin are presented in the Aggadah literature:\n(1) he belonged to the tribe of Gad,\n(2) he was a Benjamite from Jerusalem, identical with the Elijah mentioned in 1 Chronicles 8:27, and\n(3) he was a priest.\nMany Christian Church fathers also have stated that Elijah was a priest. Some rabbis have speculated that he should be identified with Phinehas.\nAccording to later Kabbalistic literature, Elijah was really an angel in human form, so that he had neither parents nor offspring.\nThe Midrash Rabbah Exodus 4:2 states \"Elijah should have revived his parents as he had revived the son of the Zarephathite\" indicating he surely had parents.\nThe Talmud states \"Said he [Rabbah] to him (Elijah): Art thou not a priest: why then dost thou stand in a cemetery?\"\nZeal for God.\nA midrash tells that they even abolished the sign of the covenant, and the prophet had to appear as Israel's accuser before God.\nIn the same cave where God once appeared to Moses and revealed Himself as gracious and merciful, Elijah was summoned to appear before God. By this summons he perceived that he should have appealed to God's mercy, instead of becoming Israel's accuser. The prophet, however, remained relentless in his zeal and severity, so that God commanded him to appoint his successor.\nThe vision in which God revealed Himself to Elijah gave him at the same time a picture of the destinies of man, who has to pass through \"four worlds.\" This world was shown to the prophet by God through symbolism: in the form of the wind, since the world disappears as the wind; storm is the day of death, before which man trembles; fire is the judgment in Gehenna; and the stillness is the last day.\nThree years after this vision, Elijah was \"translated.\" Concerning the place to which Elijah was transferred, opinions differ among Jews and Christians, but the old view was that Elijah was received among the heavenly inhabitants, where he records the deeds of men.\nBut as early as the middle of the 2nd century, when the notion of translation to heaven underwent divergent possible interpretations by Christian theologians, the assertion was made that Elijah never entered into heaven proper. In later literature paradise is generally designated as the abode of Elijah, but since the location of paradise is itself uncertain, the last two statements may be identical.\nEcclesiasticus.\nIn the Wisdom of Jesus ben Sira, his tasks are altered to: 1) herald the eschaton, 2) calm God's fury, 3) restore familial peace, and 4) restore the 12 tribes.\nIn Judaism.\nElijah's chair.\nAt Jewish circumcision ceremonies, a chair is set aside for the use of the prophet Elijah. Elijah is said to be a witness at all circumcisions when the sign of the covenant is placed upon the body of the child. This custom stems from the incident at Mount Horeb: Elijah had arrived at Mount Horeb after the demonstration of God's presence and power on Mount Carmel. God asks Elijah to explain his arrival, and Elijah replies: \"I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts; for the people of Israel have forsaken thy covenant, thrown down thy altars, and slain thy prophets with the sword; and I, even I only, am left; and they seek my life, to take it away\". According to Rabbinic tradition, Elijah's words were patently untrue, and since Elijah accused Israel of failing to uphold the covenant, God would require Elijah to be present at every covenant of circumcision.\nElijah's cup.\nIn the Talmudic literature, Elijah would visit rabbis to help solve particularly difficult legal problems. Malachi had cited Elijah as the harbinger of the eschaton. Thus, when confronted with reconciling impossibly conflicting laws or rituals, the rabbis would set aside any decision \"until Elijah comes.\"\nOne such decision was whether the Passover Seder required four or five cups of wine. Each serving of wine corresponds to one of the \"four expressions of redemption\" in the Book of Exodus:\nI am the Lord, and \"I will bring you out\" from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and \"I will deliver you\" from their bondage, and \"I will redeem you\" with an out-stretched arm and with great acts of judgment, and \"I will take you\" for my people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the Lord your God, who has brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.\"\nThe next verse, \"And \"I will bring you\" into the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; I will give it to you for a possession. I am the Lord.\" was not fulfilled until the generation following the Passover story, and the rabbis could not decide whether this verse counted as part of the Passover celebration (thus deserving of another serving of wine). Thus, a cup was left for the arrival of Elijah.\nIn practice the fifth cup has come to be seen as a celebration of future redemption. Today, a place is reserved at the seder table and a cup of wine is placed there for Elijah. During the seder, the door of the house is opened and Elijah is invited in. Traditionally, the cup is viewed as Elijah's and is used for no other purpose.\nHavdalah.\nHavdalah is the ceremony that concludes the Sabbath Day (Saturday evening in Jewish tradition). As part of the concluding hymn, an appeal is made to God that Elijah will come during the following week. \"Elijah the Prophet, Elijah the Tishbite, Elijah from Gilead. Let him come quickly, in our day with the messiah, the son of David.\"\nIn Jewish folklore.\nThe volume of references to Elijah in folklore stands in marked contrast to that in the canon. Elijah's miraculous transferral to heaven led to speculation as to his true identity. Louis Ginzberg equates him with Phinehas the grandson of Aaron. Because of Phinehas' zealousness for God, he and his descendants were promised, \"a covenant of lasting priesthood.\" Therefore, Elijah is a priest as well as a prophet. Elijah is also equated with the Archangel Sandalphon, whose four wing beats will carry him to any part of the earth. When forced to choose between death and dishonor, Rabbi Kahana chose to leap to his death. Before he could strike the ground, Elijah/Sandalphon had appeared to catch him. Yet another name for Elijah is \"Angel of the Covenant\"\nRabbi Joshua ben Levi.\nReferences to Elijah in Jewish folklore range from short observations (e. g. It is said that when dogs are happy for no reason, it is because Elijah is in the neighborhood) to lengthy parables on the nature of God's justice.\nOne such story is that of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. The rabbi, a friend of Elijah's, was asked what favor he might wish. The rabbi answered only that he be able to join Elijah in his wanderings. Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions about any of the prophet's actions. He agreed and they began their journey. The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow. The old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could. The next morning, as the travelers left, Elijah prayed that the old cow would die and it did. The second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. He had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people. As they were leaving, they passed the man's wall and saw that it was crumbling. Elijah prayed that the wall be repaired and it was so. Next, they came to a wealthy synagogue. They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. When they left, Elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader.\nFinally, they came to a very poor synagogue. Here they were treated with great courtesy and hospitality. When they left, Elijah prayed that God might give them a single wise leader. At this Rabbi Joshua could no longer hold back. He demanded of Elijah an explanation of his actions. At the house of the old couple, Elijah knew that the Angel of Death was coming for the old woman. So he prayed that God might have the angel take the cow instead. At the house of the wealthy man, there was a great treasure hidden in the crumbling wall. Elijah prayed that the wall be restored thus keeping the treasure away from the miser. The story ends with a moral: A synagogue with many leaders will be ruined by many arguments. A town with a single wise leader will be guided to success and prosperity. \"Know then, that if thou seest an evil-doer prosper, it is not always unto his advantage, and if a righteous man suffers need and distress, think not God is unjust.\"\nRabbi Eliezer.\nThe Elijah of legend did not lose any of his ability to afflict the comfortable. The case of Rabbi Eliezer son of Rabbi Simon ben Yohai is illustrative. Once, when walking on a beach, he came upon a hideously ugly man\u2014the prophet in disguise. The man greeted him courteously, \"Peace be with thee, Rabbi.\" Instead of returning the greeting, the rabbi could not resist an insult, \"How ugly you are! Is there anyone as ugly as you in your town?\" Elijah responded with, \"I don't know. Perhaps you should tell the Master Architect how ugly is this, His construction.\" The rabbi realized his wrong and asked for pardon. But Elijah would not give it until the entire city had asked for forgiveness for the rabbi and the rabbi had promised to mend his ways.\nLilith.\nElijah was always seen as deeply pious, it seems only natural that he would be pitted against an equally evil individual. This was found in the person of Lilith. Lilith in legend was the first wife of Adam. She rebelled against Adam, the angels, and even God. She came to be seen as a demon and a witch.\nElijah encountered Lilith and instantly recognized and challenged her, \"Unclean one, where are you going?\" Unable to avoid or lie to the prophet, she admitted she was on her way to the house of a pregnant woman. Her intention was to kill the woman and eat the child.\nElijah pronounced his malediction, \"I curse you in the Name of the Lord. Be silent as a stone!\" But, Lilith was able to make a bargain with Elijah. She promises to \"forsake my evil ways\" if Elijah will remove his curse. To seal the bargain she gives Elijah her names so that they can be posted in the houses of pregnant women or new born children or used as amulets. Lilith promises, \"where I see those names, I shall run away at once. Neither the child nor the mother will ever be injured by me.\"\nIn Christianity.\nNew Testament.\nIn the New Testament, Jesus would say for those who believed, John the Baptist was Elijah, who would come before the \"great and terrible day\" as predicted by Malachi.\nSome English translations of the New Testament use Elias, a Greek form of the name. In the King James Version, \"Elias\" appears only in the texts translated from Greek.\nJohn the Baptist.\nJohn the Baptist preached a message of repentance and baptism. He predicted the day of judgment using imagery similar to that of Malachi. He also preached that the Messiah was coming. All of this was done in a style that immediately recalled the image of Elijah to his audience. He wore a coat of camel's hair secured with a leather girdle. He also frequently preached in wilderness areas near the Jordan River.\nIn the Gospel of John, when John the Baptist was asked by a delegation of priests (present tense) \"Art thou Elias\", he replied \"I am not\". Matthew 11:14 and Matthew 17:10\u201313 however, make it clear that John was the spiritual successor to Elijah. In the Nativity of St. John the Baptist in Luke, Gabriel appears to Zechariah, John's father, and told him that John \"will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God,\" and that he will go forth \"in the spirit and power of Elijah.\"\nJesus Christ.\nIn the Gospel of Luke, Herod Antipas hears some of the stories surrounding Jesus Christ. Some tell Herod that Jesus is John the Baptist (whom Herod had executed) come back to life. Others tell him that Jesus is Elijah. Later in the same gospel, Jesus asks his disciples who the people say that he is. The apostles' answer includes Elijah among others.\nHowever Jesus' ministry had little in common with that of Elijah; in particular, he preached the forgiveness of one's enemies, while Elijah killed his. Miracle stories similar to those of Elijah were associated with Jesus (\"e.g.\", raising of the dead, miraculous feeding). Jesus implicitly separates himself from Elijah when he rebukes James and John for desiring to call down fire upon an unwelcoming Samaritan village in a similar manner to Elijah. Likewise, Jesus rebukes a potential follower who wanted first to return home to say farewell to his family, whereas Elijah permitted this of his replacement Elisha.\nDuring Jesus' crucifixion, some of the onlookers wonder if Elijah will come to rescue him, as by the time of Jesus, Elijah had entered folklore as a rescuer of Jews in distress.\nTransfiguration.\nElijah makes an appearance in the New Testament during an incident known as the Transfiguration.\nAt the summit of an unnamed mount, Jesus' face begins to shine. The disciples who are with Him hear the voice of God announce that Jesus is \"My beloved Son.\" The disciples also see Moses and Elijah appear and talk with Jesus. This apparently relates to how both Elijah and Moses, the latter according to tradition but not the Bible, both were translated to heaven instead of dying. Peter is so struck by the experience that he asks Jesus if they should build three \"tabernacles\": one for Elijah, one for Jesus and one for Moses.\nThere is agreement among some Christian theologians that Elijah appears to hand over the responsibility of the prophets to Jesus as the woman by the well said to Jesus \"I perceive thou art a prophet.\" Moses also likewise came to hand over the responsibility of the law for the divinely announced Son of God.\nOther references.\nElijah is mentioned four more times in the New Testament: in Luke, Romans, Hebrews, and James. In Luke 4:24\u201327, Jesus uses Elijah as an example of rejected prophets. Jesus says, \"No prophet is accepted in his own country,\" and then mentions Elijah, saying that there were many widows in Israel, but Elijah was sent to one in Phoenicia. In Romans 11:1\u20136, Paul cites Elijah as an example of God's never forsaking his people (the Israelites). Hebrews 11:35 (\"Women received their dead raised to life again...\") refers to both Elijah raising the son of the widow of Zarephath and Elisha raising the son of the woman of Shunem, citing both Elijah and Elisha as Old Testament examples of faith. In James 5:16\u201318, James says, \"The effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much,\" and then cites Elijah's prayers which started and ended the famine in Israel as examples.\nProphet saint.\nIn Western Christianity, Elijah is commemorated as a saint with a feast day on 20 July by the Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod. Catholics believe that he was unmarried and celibate.\nIn the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite, he is commemorated on the same date (in the 21st century, Julian Calendar 20 July corresponds to Gregorian Calendar 2 August). He is greatly revered among the Orthodox as a model of the contemplative life. He is also commemorated on the Orthodox liturgical calendar on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers (the Sunday before the Nativity of the Lord).\nElijah has been venerated as the patron saint of Bosnia and Herzegovina since 26 August 1752, replacing George of Lydda at the request of Bishop Pavao Dragi\u010devi\u0107. The reasons for the replacement are unclear. It has been suggested that Elijah was chosen because of his importance to all three main religious groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2014Catholics, Muslims and Orthodox Christians. Pope Benedict XIV is said to have approved Bishop Dragi\u010devi\u0107's request with the remark that a wild nation deserved a wild patron.\nCarmelite tradition.\nElijah is revered as the spiritual Father and traditional founder of the Catholic religious Order of Carmelites. In addition to taking their name from Mt. Carmel where the first hermits of the order established themselves, the Calced Carmelite and Discalced Carmelite traditions pertaining to Elijah focus upon the prophet's withdrawal from public life. The medieval Carmelite Book of the First Monks offers some insight into the heart of the Orders' contemplative vocation and reverence for the prophet.\nIn the 17th century the Bollandist Society, whose declared aim was to search out and classify materials concerning the saints venerated by the Church, and to print what seemed to be the most reliable sources of information entered into controversy with the Carmelites on this point. In writing of St. Albert, Patriarch of Jerusalem and author of the Carmelite rule, the Bollandist Daniel Papebroch stated that the attribution of Carmelite origin to Elijah was insufficiently grounded. The Carmelites reacted strongly. From 1681 to 1698 a series of letters, pamphlets and other documents was issued by each side. The Carmelites were supported by a Spanish tribunal, while the Bollandists had the support of Jean de Launoy and the Sorbonne. In November 1698, Pope Innocent XII ordered an end to the controversy.\nLiturgical commemorations.\nSince most Eastern Churches either use Greek as their liturgical language or translated their liturgies from the Greek, \"Elias\" (or its modern iotacized form \"Ilias\") is the form of the prophet's name used among most members of the Eastern Orthodox Church and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite.\nThe feast day of saint Elias falls on 20 July of the Orthodox liturgical calendar (for those churches which follow the traditional Julian Calendar, 20 July currently falls on 2 August of the modern Gregorian Calendar). This day is a major holiday in Lebanon and is one of a handful of holidays there whose celebration is accompanied by a launching of fireworks by the general public. The full name of St. Elias in Lebanon translates to St. Elias the Living because it is believed that he did not die but rode his fiery chariot to heaven. The reference to the fiery chariot is likely why the Lebanese celebrate this holiday with fireworks.\nElias is also commemorated, together with all of the righteous persons of the Old Testament, on the Sunday of the Holy Fathers (the Sunday before the Nativity of the Lord).\nThe Apolytikion in the Fourth Tone for St. Elias:\nThe incarnate Angel, the Cornerstone of the Prophets, the second Forerunner of the Coming of Christ, the glorious Elias, who from above, sent down to Elisha the grace to dispel sickness and cleanse lepers, abounds therefore in healing for those who honor him.\nThe Kontakion in the Second Tone for St. Elias:\nO Prophet and foreseer of the great works of God, O greatly renowned Elias, who by your word held back the clouds of rain, intercede for us to the only Loving One.\nPagan associations and mountaintops.\nStarting in the fifth century, Elias is often connected with Helios, the Sun. The two words have very similar pronunciations in post-classical Greek; Elijah rode in his chariot of fire to heaven just as Helios drove the chariot of the sun across the sky; and the holocaust sacrifice offered by Elijah and burned by fire from heaven corresponds to the sun warming the earth.\nSedulius writes poetically in the fifth century that the \"bright path to glittering heaven\" suits Elias both \"in merits and name\", as changing one letter makes his name \"Helios\"; but he does not identify the two. A homily entitled \"De ascensione Heliae\", misattributed to Chrysostom, claims that poets and painters use the ascension of Elijah as a model for their depictions of the sun, and says that \"Elijah is really Helios\". Saint Patrick appears to conflate Helios and Elias. In modern times, much Greek folklore also connects Elias with the sun.\nIn Greece, chapels and monasteries dedicated to Prophet Elias (\u03a0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c6\u03ae\u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u0397\u03bb\u03af\u03b1\u03c2) are often found on mountaintops, which themselves are often named after him. Since Wachsmuth (1864), the usual explanation for this has been that Elias was identified with Helios, who had mountaintop shrines. But few shrines of Helios were on mountaintops, and sun-worship was subsumed by Apollo-worship by Christian times, and so could not be confused with Elias. The modern folklore is not good evidence for the \"origin\" of the association of the sun, Elias, and mountaintops. Perhaps Elias is simply a \"natural patron of high places\".\nThe association of Elias with mountaintops seems to come from a different pagan tradition: Elias took on the attributes and the locales associated with Zeus, especially his associations with mountains and his powers over rain, thunder, lighting, and wind. When Elias prevailed over the priests of Baal, it was on Mount Carmel which later became known as Mount St. Elias. When he spent forty days in a cave, it was on Mount Horeb. When Elias confronted Ahab, he stopped the rains for three years.\nA map of mountain-cults of Zeus shows that most of these sites are now dedicated to Elias, including Mount Olympus, Mount Lykaion, Mount Arachnaion, and Mount Taleton on the mainland, and Mount Kenaion, Mount Oche, and Mount Kynados in the islands. Of these, the only one with a recorded tradition of a Helios cult is Mount Taleton.\nElias is associated with pre-Christian lightning gods in many other European traditions.\nAmong Albanians, pilgrimages are made to mountaintops to ask for rain during the summer. One such tradition that is gaining popularity is the 2 August pilgrimage to Ljuboten on the Sharr mountains. Muslims refer to this day as \"Aligjyn\" (\"Ali Day\"), and it is believed that Ali becomes Elias at midday.\nAs Elijah was described as ascending into heaven in a fiery chariot, the Christian missionaries who converted Slavic tribes likely found him an ideal analogy for Perun, the supreme Slavic god of storms, thunder and lightning bolts. In many Slavic countries Elijah is known as Elijah the Thunderer (\"Ilija Gromovnik\"), who drives the heavens in a chariot and administers rain and snow, thus actually taking the place of Perun in popular beliefs. Perun is also sometimes conflated with the legendary hero Elijah of Murom. The feast of St. Elias is known as \"Ilinden\" in South Slavic, and was chosen as the day of the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising in 1903; it is now the holiday of Republic Day in North Macedonia.\nIn Estonian folklore Elijah is considered to be the successor of Ukko, the lightning spirit.\nIn Georgian mythology, he replaces Elwa. A Georgian story about Elijah:\nOnce Jesus, the prophet Elijah, and St. George were going through Georgia. When they became tired and hungry they stopped to dine. They saw a Georgian shepherd and decided to ask him to feed them. First, Elijah went up to the shepherd and asked him for a sheep. After the shepherd asked his identity Elijah said that, he was the one who sent him rain to get him a good profit from farming. The shepherd became angry at him and told him that he was the one who also sent thunderstorms, which destroyed the farms of poor widows. (After Elijah, Jesus and St. George attempt to get help and eventually succeed).\nElias has other pagan associations: a modern legend about Elias mirrors precisely the legend of Odysseus seeking a place where the locals would not recognize an oar\u2014hence the mountaintops.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints acknowledges Elijah as a prophet. The Church teaches that the Malachi prophecy of the return of Elijah was fulfilled on 3 April 1836, when Elijah visited the prophet and founder of the church, Joseph Smith, along with Oliver Cowdery, in the Kirtland Temple as a resurrected being. This event is chronicled in . This experience forms the basis for the church's focus on genealogy and family history and belief in the eternal nature of marriage and families.\nIn Latter-day Saint theology, the name-title Elias is not always synonymous with Elijah and is often used for people other than the biblical prophet. According to Joseph Smith,\nThe spirit of Elias is first, Elijah second, and Messiah last. Elias is a forerunner to prepare the way, and the spirit and power of Elijah is to come after, holding the keys of power, building the Temple to the capstone, placing the seals of the Melchizedek Priesthood upon the house of Israel, and making all things ready; then Messiah comes to His Temple, which is last of all.\nPeople to whom the title Elias is applied in Mormonism include Noah, the angel Gabriel (who is considered to be the same person as Noah in Mormon doctrine), Elijah, John the Baptist, John the Apostle, and an unspecified man who was a contemporary of Abraham.\nDetractors of Mormonism have often alleged that Smith, in whose time and place the King James Version was the only available English translation of the Bible, simply failed to grasp the fact that the Elijah of the Old Testament and the Elias of the New Testament are the same person. Latter-day Saints deny this and say that the difference they make between the two is deliberate and prophetic. The names Elias and Elijah refer to one who prepares the way for the coming of the Lord. This is applicable to John the Baptist coming to prepare the way for the Lord and His baptism; it also refers to Elijah appearing during the transfiguration to prepare for Jesus by restoring keys of sealing power. Jesus then gave this power to the Twelve saying, \"Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\"\nIn Islam.\nElijah/Elias ( or ; \"Ily\u0101s/Ely\u0101s\" or \"Ilya\") is also mentioned as a prophet in . Elijah's narrative in the Quran and later Muslim tradition resembles closely that in the Hebrew Bible and Muslim literature records Elijah's primary prophesying as taking place during the reign of Ahab and Jezebel as well as Ahaziah. He is seen by Muslims to be the prophetic predecessor to Elisha. While neither the Bible nor the Quran mentions the genealogy of Elijah, some scholars of Islam believe he may have come from the priestly family of the prophet Aaron. Elijah is rarely associated with Islamic eschatology and Islam views Jesus as the Messiah. However, Elijah is expected to come back along with the mysterious figure known as Khidr during the Last Judgment. Elijah's figure has been identified with a number of other prophets and saints, including Idris, which is believed by some scholars to have been another name for Elijah, and Khidr. Islamic legend later developed the figure of Elijah, greatly embellishing upon his attributes, and some apocryphal literature gave Elijah the status of a half-human, half-angel. Elijah also appears in later works of literature, including the \"Hamzanama\".\nQuran.\nElijah is mentioned in the Quran, where his preaching is recounted in a concise manner. The Quran narrates that Elijah told his people to come to the worship of God and to leave the worship of Baal, the primary idol of the area. The Quran states, \"Verily Elijah was one of the apostles. When he said to his people: \"Will you not fear God? \"Will ye call upon Ba'al and leave the Best of Creators, God, your and Cherisher and the and Cherisher of your fathers of old?\" As-Saaffat 123\u2013126\nThe Quran makes it clear that the majority of Elijah's people denied the prophet and continued to follow idolatry. However, it mentions that a small number of devoted servants of God among them followed Elijah and believed in and worshiped God. The Quran states, \"They denied him (Elijah), and will surely be brought to punishment, Except the sincere and devoted Servants of God (among them). And We left his (memory) for posterity.\"\nIn the Quran, God praises Elijah in two places:\nNumerous commentators, including Abdullah Yusuf Ali, have offered commentary on VI: 85 saying that Elijah, Zechariah, John the Baptist and Jesus were all spiritually connected. Abdullah Yusuf Ali says, \"The third group consists not of men of action, but Preachers of Truth, who led solitary lives. Their epithet is: \"the Righteous.\" They form a connected group round Jesus. Zachariah was the father of John the Baptist, who is referenced as \"Elias, which was for to come\" (Matt 11:14); and Elias is said to have been present and talked to Jesus at the Transfiguration on the Mount (Matt. 17:3).\"\nLiterature and tradition.\nMuslim literature and tradition recounts that Elijah preached to the Kingdom of Israel, ruled over by Ahab and later his son Ahaziah. He is believed to have been a \"prophet of the desert\u2014like John the Baptist\". Elijah is believed to have preached with zeal to Ahab and his wife Jezebel, who according to Muslim tradition was partly responsible for the worship of false idols in this area. Muslims believe that it was because the majority of people refused to listen to Elijah that Elisha had to continue preaching the message of God to Israel after him.\nElijah has been the subject of legends and folktales in Muslim culture, usually involving his meeting with Khidr, and in one legend, with Muhammad himself. In Islamic mysticism, Elijah is associated closely with the sage Khidr. One hadith reported that Elijah and Khidr met together every year in Jerusalem to go on the pilgrimage to Mecca. Elijah appears also in the \"Hamzanama\" numerous times, where he is spoken of as being the brother of Khidr as well as one who drank from the Fountain of Youth.\nFurther, It is narrated in Kitab al-Kafi that Imam Ja'far al-Sadiq was reciting the prostration of Ilyas (Elijah) in the Syrian language and began to weep. He then translated the supplication in Arabic to a group of visiting scholars: \n&lt;poem&gt;\n\"O Lord, will I find that you punish me although you know of my thirst in the heat of midday? Will I find that you punish me although you know that I rub my face on Earth to worship you? Will I find that you punish me although you know that I give up sins for you? Will I find that you punish me although you know that I stay awake all night just for you?\" To which Allah then inspired to Ilyas, \"Raise your head from the Earth for I will not punish you\".\n&lt;/poem&gt;\nAlthough most Muslim scholars believed that Elijah preached in Israel, some early commentators on the Quran stated that Elijah was sent to Baalbek, in Lebanon. Modern scholars have rejected this claim, stating that the connection of the city with Elijah would have been made because of the first half of the city's name, that of \"Baal\", which was the deity that Elijah exhorted his people to stop worshiping. Scholars who reject identification of Elijah's town with Baalbek further argue that the town of Baalbek is not mentioned with the narrative of Elijah in either the Quran or the Hebrew Bible.\nIn Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nIn the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, the B\u00e1b, founder of the B\u00e1b\u00ed Faith, is believed to be the return of Elijah and John the Baptist. Both Elijah and John the Baptist are considered to be Lesser Prophets, whose stations are below that of a Manifestation of God like Jesus Christ, Buddha, the B\u00e1b or Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h. The B\u00e1b is buried on Mount Carmel, where Elijah had his confrontation with the prophets of Baal.\nControversies.\nMiracle of the ravens.\nThat \"ravens\" fed Elijah by the brook Chorath has been questioned. The Hebrew text at 1 Kings 17:4\u20136 uses the word \"`\u014drv\u012bm\", which means \"ravens\", but with a different vocalization might equally mean \"Arabs\". The Septuagint has , \"ravens\", and other traditional translations followed.\nAlternatives have been proposed for many years; for example Adam Clarke (d. 1832) treated it as a discussion already of long standing. Objections to the traditional translation are that ravens are ritually unclean as well as physically dirty; it is difficult to imagine any method of delivery of the food which is not disgusting. The parallelism with the incident that follows, where Elijah is fed by the widow, also suggests a human, if mildly improbable, agent.\nProf. John Gray chooses \"Arabs\", saying \"We adopt this reading solely because of its congruity with the sequel, where Elijah is fed by an alien Phoenician woman.\" His translation of the verses in question is:\nAnd the word of Jehovah came to Elijah saying, Go hence and turn eastward and hide thyself in the Wadi Chorath east of the Jordan, and it shall be that thou shalt drink of the wadi, and I have commanded the Arabs to feed thee there. And he went and did according to the word of Jehovah and went and dwelt in the Wadi Chorath east of the Jordan. And the Arabs brought him bread in the morning and flesh in the evening and he would drink of the wadi.\nFire on Mount Carmel.\nThe challenge to the priests of Baal had the two-fold purpose of demonstrating that the God of Israel was greater than Baal, and that it was he who was the giver of rain. According to J. Robinson, \"Some scholars have suggested that the pouring of water was a piece of sympathetic magic.\"\nHugo Gressmann suggested that the fire that destroyed the offering and altar was lightning, while Ferdinand Hitzig and others thought the water poured on the sacrifice and into the ditch might have been flammable naphtha. Baptist scholar H. H. Rowley rejects both views. Robinson dismisses the suggestion of naphtha with the view that the priests of Baal would have been aware of the properties of naphtha. Julian Morgenstern rejects the idea of sympathetic magic, but supports the interpretation of white naphtha possibly ignited by a glass or mirror to focus the sun's rays, citing other mentions of sacred fire, as in 2 Maccabees 1:18\u201322.\nAscension into the heavens.\nIn the Gospel of John, Jesus says: \"And no man hath ascended up to heaven, but he that came down from heaven, [\"even\"] the Son of man which is in heaven.\"\nTraditionally Christianity interprets the \"Son of Man\" as a title of Jesus, but this has never been an article of faith and there are other interpretations. Further interpreting this quote, some Christians believe that Elijah was not assumed into heaven but simply transferred to another assignment either in heaven or with King Jehoram of Judah. The prophets reacted in such a way that makes sense if he was carried away, and not simply straight up.\nThe question of whether Elijah was in heaven or elsewhere on earth depends partly on the view of the letter Jehoram received from Elijah in 2 Chronicles 21 after Elijah had ascended. Some have suggested that the letter was written before Elijah ascended, but only delivered later. The rabbinical Seder Olam explains that the letter was delivered seven years after his ascension. This is also a possible explanation for some variation in manuscripts of Josephus' \"Antiquities of the Jews\" when dealing with this issue. Others have argued that Elijah was only \"caught away\" such as Philip in Acts 8 John Lightfoot reasoned that it must have been a different Elijah.\nElijah's name typically occurs in Jewish lists of those who have entered heaven alive.\nReturn.\nCenturies after his departure the Jewish nation awaits the coming of Elijah to precede the coming of the Messiah. For many Christians this prophecy was fulfilled in the gospels, where he appears during the Transfiguration alongside Moses. Commentators have said that Moses' appearance represented the law, while Elijah's appearance represented the prophets. \nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes that Elijah returned on 3 April 1836 in an appearance to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery, fulfilling the prophecy in Malachi.\nThe Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith believes Elijah returned as the biblical prophet John the Baptist and as the B\u00e1b who founded the B\u00e1b\u00ed Faith in 1844.\nThe Nation of Islam believes Elijah returned as Elijah Muhammad, black separatist religious leader (who claimed to be a \"messenger\", not a prophet). This is considered less important than their belief that Allah himself showed up in the person of Fard Muhammad, the founder of the group. It differs notably from most beliefs about Elijah, in that his re-appearance is usually the precursor to a greater one's appearance, rather than an aftierthought."}
{"id": "9841", "revid": "24247980", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9841", "title": "Expressive aphasia", "text": "Expressive aphasia, also known as Broca's aphasia, is a type of aphasia characterized by partial loss of the ability to produce language (spoken, manual, or written), although comprehension generally remains intact. A person with expressive aphasia will exhibit effortful speech. Speech generally includes important content words but leaves out function words that have more grammatical significance than physical meaning, such as prepositions and articles. This is known as \"telegraphic speech\". The person's intended message may still be understood, but their sentence will not be grammatically correct. In very severe forms of expressive aphasia, a person may only speak using single word utterances. Typically, comprehension is mildly to moderately impaired in expressive aphasia due to difficulty understanding complex grammar.\nIt is caused by acquired damage to the anterior regions of the brain, such as Broca's area. It is one subset of a larger family of disorders known collectively as aphasia. Expressive aphasia contrasts with receptive aphasia, in which patients are able to speak in grammatical sentences that lack semantic significance and generally also have trouble with comprehension. Expressive aphasia differs from dysarthria, which is typified by a patient's inability to properly move the muscles of the tongue and mouth to produce speech. Expressive aphasia also differs from apraxia of speech, which is a motor disorder characterized by an inability to create and sequence motor plans for speech.\nSigns and symptoms.\nBroca's (expressive) aphasia is a type of non-fluent aphasia in which an individual's speech is halting and effortful. Misarticulations or distortions of consonants and vowels, namely phonetic dissolution, are common. Individuals with expressive aphasia may only produce single words, or words in groups of two or three. Long pauses between words are common and multi-syllabic words may be produced one syllable at a time with pauses between each syllable. The prosody of a person with Broca's aphasia is compromised by shortened length of utterances and the presence of self-repairs and disfluencies. Intonation and stress patterns are also deficient.\nFor example, in the following passage, a patient with Broca's aphasia is trying to explain how he came to the hospital for dental surgery:Yes... ah... Monday... er... Dad and Peter H... (his own name), and Dad... er... hospital... and ah... Wednesday... Wednesday, nine o'clock... and oh... Thursday... ten o'clock, ah doctors... two... an' doctors... and er... teeth... yah.The speech of a person with expressive aphasia contains mostly content words such as nouns, verbs, and some adjectives. However, function words like conjunctions, articles, and prepositions are rarely used except for \u201cand\u201d which is prevalent in the speech of most patients with aphasia. The omission of function words makes the person's speech agrammatic. A communication partner of a person with aphasia may say that the person's speech sounds telegraphic due to poor sentence construction and disjointed words. For example, a person with expressive aphasia might say \"Smart... university... smart... good... good...\"\nSelf-monitoring is typically well preserved in patients with Broca's aphasia. They are usually aware of their communication deficits, and are more prone to depression and outbursts from frustration than are patients with other forms of aphasia.[7]\nIn general, word comprehension is preserved, allowing patients to have functional receptive language skills. Individuals with Broca's aphasia understand most of the everyday conversation around them, but higher-level deficits in receptive language can occur. Because comprehension is substantially impaired for more complex sentences, it is better to use simple language when speaking with an individual with expressive aphasia. This is exemplified by the difficulty to understand phrases or sentences with unusual structure. A typical patient with Broca's aphasia will misinterpret \"the man is bitten by the dog\" by switching the subject and object to \u201cthe dog is bitten by the man.\u201d\nTypically, people with expressive aphasia can understand speech and read better than they can produce speech and write. The person's writing will resemble their speech and will be effortful, lacking cohesion, and containing mostly content words. Letters will likely be formed clumsily and distorted and some may even be omitted. Although listening and reading are generally intact, subtle deficits in both reading and listening comprehension are almost always present during assessment of aphasia.\nBecause Broca's area is anterior to the primary motor cortex, which is responsible for movement of the face, hands, and arms, a lesion affecting Broca's areas may also result in hemiparesis (weakness of both limbs on the same side of the body) or hemiplegia (paralysis of both limbs on the same side of the body). The brain is wired contralaterally, which means the limbs on right side of the body are controlled by the left hemisphere and vice versa. Therefore, when Broca's area or surrounding areas in the left hemisphere are damaged, hemiplegia or hemiparesis often occurs on the right side of the body in individuals with Broca's aphasia.\nSeverity of expressive aphasia varies among patients. Some people may only have mild deficits and detecting problems with their language may be difficult. In the most extreme cases, patients may be able to produce only a single word. Even in such cases, over-learned and rote-learned speech patterns may be retained\u2013 for instance, some patients can count from one to ten, but cannot produce the same numbers in novel conversation.\nManual language and aphasia.\nIn deaf patients who use manual language (such as American Sign Language), damage to the left hemisphere of the brain leads to disruptions in their signing ability. Paraphasic errors similar to spoken language have been observed; whereas in spoken language a phonemic substitution would occur (e.g. \"tagle\" instead of \"table\"), in ASL case studies errors in movement, hand position, and morphology have been noted. Agrammatism, or the lack of grammatical morphemes in sentence production, has also been observed in lifelong users of ASL who have left hemisphere damage. The lack of syntactic accuracy shows that the errors in signing are not due to damage to the motor cortex, but rather are a manifestation of the damage to the language-producing area of the brain. Similar symptoms have been seen in a patient with left hemisphere damage whose first language was British Sign Language, further showing that damage to the left hemisphere primarily hinders linguistic ability, not motor ability. In contrast, patients who have damage to non-linguistic areas on the left hemisphere have been shown to be fluent in signing, but are unable to comprehend written language.\nOverlap with receptive aphasia.\nIn addition to difficulty expressing oneself, individuals with expressive aphasia are also noted to commonly have trouble with comprehension in certain linguistic areas. This agrammatism overlaps with receptive aphasia, but can be seen in patients who have expressive aphasia without being diagnosed as having receptive aphasia. The most well-noted of these are object-relative clauses, object Wh- questions, and topicalized structures (placing the topic at the beginning of the sentence). These three concepts all share phrasal movement, which can cause words to lose their thematic roles when they change order in the sentence. This is often not an issue for people without agrammatic aphasias, but many people with aphasia rely heavily on word order to understand roles that words play within the sentence.\nCauses.\nLess common.\nCommon causes.\nThe most common cause of expressive aphasia is stroke. A stroke is caused by hypoperfusion (lack of oxygen) to an area of the brain, which is commonly caused by thrombosis or embolism. Some form of aphasia occurs in 34 to 38% of stroke patients. Expressive aphasia occurs in approximately 12% of new cases of aphasia caused by stroke.\nIn most cases, expressive aphasia is caused by a stroke in Broca's area or the surrounding vicinity. Broca's area is in the lower part of the premotor cortex in the language dominant hemisphere and is responsible for planning motor speech movements. However, cases of expressive aphasia have been seen in patients with strokes in other areas of the brain. Patients with classic symptoms of expressive aphasia in general have more acute brain lesions, whereas patients with larger, widespread lesions exhibit a variety of symptoms that may be classified as global aphasia or left unclassified.\nExpressive aphasia can also be caused by trauma to the brain, tumor, cerebral hemorrhage and by extradural abscess.\nUnderstanding lateralization of brain function is important for understanding which areas of the brain cause expressive aphasia when damaged. In the past, it has been believed that the area for language production differs between left and right-handed individuals. If this were true, damage to the homologous region of Broca's area in the right hemisphere should cause aphasia in a left-handed individual. More recent studies have shown that even left-handed individuals typically have language functions only in the left hemisphere. However, left-handed individuals are more likely to have a dominance of language in the right hemisphere.\nUncommon causes.\nLess common causes of expressive aphasia include primary autoimmune phenomenon and autoimmune phenomenon that are secondary to cancer (as a paraneoplastic syndrome) have been listed as the primary hypothesis for several cases of aphasia, especially when presenting with other psychiatric disturbances and focal neurological deficits. Many case reports exist describing paraneoplastic aphasia, and the reports that are specific tend to describe expressive aphasia. Although most cases attempt to exclude micrometastasis, it is likely that some cases of paraneoplastic aphasia are actually extremely small metastasis to the vocal motor regions.\nNeurodegenerative disorders may present with aphasia. Alzheimer's disease may present with either fluent aphasia or expressive aphasia. There are case reports of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease presenting with expressive aphasia.\nDiagnosis.\nExpressive aphasia is classified as non-fluent aphasia, as opposed to fluent aphasia. Diagnosis is done on a case-by-case basis, as lesions often affect the surrounding cortex and deficits are highly variable among patients with aphasia.\nA physician is typically the first person to recognize aphasia in a patient who is being treated for damage to the brain. Routine processes for determining the presence and location of lesion in the brain include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans. The physician will complete a brief assessment of the patient's ability to understand and produce language. For further diagnostic testing, the physician will refer the patient to a speech-language pathologist, who will complete a comprehensive evaluation.\nIn order to diagnose a patient who is suffering from Broca's aphasia, there are certain commonly used tests and procedures. The Western Aphasia Battery (WAB) classifies individuals based on their scores on the subtests; spontaneous speech, auditory comprehension, repetition, and naming. The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination (BDAE) can inform users what specific type of aphasia they may have, infer the location of lesion, and assess current language abilities. The Porch Index of Communication Ability (PICA) can predict potential recovery outcomes of the patients with aphasia. Quality of life measurement is also an important assessment tool. Tests such as the Assessment for Living with Aphasia (ALA) and the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) allow for therapists to target skills that are important and meaningful for the individual.\nIn addition to formal assessments, patient and family interviews are valid and important sources of information. The patient's previous hobbies, interests, personality, and occupation are all factors that will not only impact therapy but may motivate them throughout the recovery process. Patient interviews and observations allow professionals to learn the priorities of the patient and family and determine what the patient hopes to regain in therapy. Observations of the patient may also be beneficial to determine where to begin treatment. The current behaviors and interactions of the patient will provide the therapist with more insight about the client and their individual needs. Other information about the patient can be retrieved from medical records, patient referrals from physicians, and the nursing staff.\nIn non-speaking patients who use manual languages, diagnosis is often based on interviews from the patient's acquaintances, noting the differences in sign production pre- and post-damage to the brain. Many of these patients will also begin to rely on non-linguistic gestures to communicate, rather than signing since their language production is hindered.\nTreatment.\nCurrently, there is no standard treatment for expressive aphasia. Most aphasia treatment is individualized based on a patient's condition and needs as assessed by a speech language pathologist. Patients go through a period of spontaneous recovery following brain injury in which they regain a great deal of language function.\nIn the months following injury or stroke, most patients receive traditional treatment for a few hours per day. Among other exercises, patients practice the repetition of words and phrases. Mechanisms are also taught in traditional treatment to compensate for lost language function such as drawing and using phrases that are easier to pronounce.\nEmphasis is placed on establishing a basis for communication with family and caregivers in everyday life. Treatment is individualized based on the patient's own priorities, along with the family's input.\nA patient may have the option of individual or group treatment. Although less common, group treatment has been shown to have advantageous outcomes. Some types of group treatments include family counseling, maintenance groups, support groups and treatment groups.\nMelodic intonation therapy.\nMelodic intonation therapy was inspired by the observation that individuals with non-fluent aphasia sometimes can sing words or phrases that they normally cannot speak. \"Melodic Intonation Therapy was begun as an attempt to use the intact melodic/prosodic processing skills of the right hemisphere in those with aphasia to help cue retrieval words and expressive language.\" It is believed that this is because singing capabilities are stored in the right hemisphere of the brain, which is likely to remain unaffected after a stroke in the left hemisphere. However, recent evidence demonstrates that the capability of individuals with aphasia to sing entire pieces of text may actually result from rhythmic features and the familiarity with the lyrics.\nThe goal of Melodic Intonation Therapy is to utilize singing to access the language-capable regions in the right hemisphere and use these regions to compensate for lost function in the left hemisphere. The natural musical component of speech was used to engage the patients' ability to produce phrases. A clinical study revealed that singing and rhythmic speech may be similarly effective in the treatment of non-fluent aphasia and apraxia of speech. Moreover, evidence from randomized controlled trials is still needed to confirm that Melodic Intonation Therapy is suitable to improve propositional utterances and speech intelligibility in individuals with (chronic) non-fluent aphasia and apraxia of speech.\nMelodic Intonation Therapy appears to work particularly well in patients who have had a unilateral, left hemisphere stroke, show poor articulation, are non-fluent or have severely restricted speech output, have moderately preserved auditory comprehension, and show good motivation. MIT therapy on average lasts for 1.5 hours per day for five days per week. At the lowest level of therapy, simple words and phrases (such as \"water\" and \"I love you\") are broken down into a series of high- and low-pitch syllables. With increased treatment, longer phrases are taught and less support is provided by the therapist. Patients are taught to say phrases using the natural melodic component of speaking and continuous voicing is emphasized. The patient is also instructed to use the left hand to tap the syllables of the phrase while the phrases are spoken. Tapping is assumed to trigger the rhythmic component of speaking to utilize the right hemisphere.\nFMRI studies have shown that Melodic Intonation Therapy (MIT) uses both sides of the brain to recover lost function, as opposed to traditional therapies that utilize only the left hemisphere. In MIT, individuals with small lesions in the left hemisphere seem to recover by activation of the left hemisphere perilesional cortex. Meanwhile, individuals with larger left-hemisphere lesions show a recruitment of the use of language-capable regions in the right hemisphere. The interpretation of these results is still a matter of debate. For example, it remains unclear whether changes in neural activity in the right hemisphere result from singing or from the intensive use of common phrases, such as \"thank you\", \"how are you?\" or \"I am fine.\" This type of phrases falls into the category of formulaic language and is known to be supported by neural networks of the intact right hemisphere.\nA pilot study reported positive results when comparing the efficacy of a modified form of MIT to no treatment in people with nonfluent aphasia with damage to their left-brain. A randomized controlled trial was conducted and the study reported benefits of utilizing modified MIT treatment early in the recovery phase for people with nonfluent aphasia.\nMelodic Intonation Therapy is used by music therapists, board-certified professionals that use music as a therapeutic tool to effect certain non-musical outcomes in their patients. Speech language pathologists can also use this therapy for individuals who have had a left hemisphere stroke and non-fluent aphasias such as Broca's or even apraxia of speech.\nConstraint-induced therapy.\nConstraint-induced aphasia therapy (CIAT) is based on similar principles as constraint-induced movement therapy developed by Dr. Edward Taub at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Constraint-induced movement therapy is based on the idea that a person with an impairment (physical or communicative) develops a \"learned nonuse\" by compensating for the lost function with other means such as using an unaffected limb by a paralyzed individual or drawing by a patient with aphasia. In constraint-induced movement therapy, the alternative limb is constrained with a glove or sling and the patient is forced to use the affected limb. In constraint-induced aphasia therapy the interaction is guided by communicative need in a language game context, picture cards, barriers making it impossible to see other players' cards, and other materials, so that patients are encouraged (\"constrained\") to use the remaining verbal abilities to succeed in the communication game.\nTwo important principles of constraint-induced aphasia therapy are that treatment is very intense, with sessions lasting for up to 6 hours over the course of 10 days and that language is used in a communication context in which it is closely linked to (nonverbal) actions. These principles are motivated by neuroscience insights about learning at the level of nerve cells (synaptic plasticity) and the coupling between cortical systems for language and action in the human brain. Constraint-induced therapy contrasts sharply with traditional therapy by the strong belief that mechanisms to compensate for lost language function, such as gesturing or writing, should not be used unless absolutely necessary, even in everyday life.\nIt is believed that CIAT works by the mechanism of increased neuroplasticity. By constraining an individual to use only speech, it is believed that the brain is more likely to reestablish old neural pathways and recruit new neural pathways to compensate for lost function.\nThe strongest results of CIAT have been seen in patients with chronic aphasia (lasting over 6 months). Studies of CIAT have confirmed that further improvement is possible even after a patient has reached a \"plateau\" period of recovery. It has also been proven that the benefits of CIAT are retained long term. However, improvements only seem to be made while a patient is undergoing intense therapy. Recent work has investigated combining constraint-induced aphasia therapy with drug treatment, which led to an amplification of therapy benefits.\nMedication.\nIn addition to active speech therapy, pharmaceuticals have also been considered as a useful treatment for expressive aphasia. This area of study is relatively new and much research continues to be conducted.\nThe following drugs have been suggested for use in treating aphasia and their efficacy has been studied in control studies.\nThe most effect has been shown by piracetam and amphetamine, which may increase cerebral plasticity and result in an increased capability to improve language function. It has been seen that piracetam is most effective when treatment is begun immediately following stroke. When used in chronic cases it has been much less efficient.\nBromocriptine has been shown by some studies to increase verbal fluency and word retrieval with therapy than with just therapy alone. Furthermore, its use seems to be restricted to non-fluent aphasia.\nDonepezil has shown a potential for helping chronic aphasia.\nNo study has established irrefutable evidence that any drug is an effective treatment for aphasia therapy. Furthermore, no study has shown any drug to be specific for language recovery. Comparison between the recovery of language function and other motor function using any drug has shown that improvement is due to a global increase plasticity of neural networks.\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation.\nIn transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), magnetic fields are used to create electrical currents in specified cortical regions. The procedure is a painless and noninvasive method of stimulating the cortex. TMS works by suppressing the inhibition process in certain areas of the brain. By suppressing the inhibition of neurons by external factors, the targeted area of the brain may be reactivated and thereby recruited to compensate for lost function. Research has shown that patients can demonstrate increased object naming ability with regular transcranial magnetic stimulation than patients not receiving TMS. Furthermore, research suggests this improvement is sustained upon the completion of TMS therapy. However, some patients fail to show any significant improvement from TMS which indicates the need for further research of this treatment.\nTreatment of underlying forms.\nDescribed as the linguistic approach to the treatment of expressive aphasia, treatment begins by emphasizing and educating patients on the thematic roles of words within sentences. Sentences that are usually problematic will be reworded into active-voiced, declarative phrasings of their non-canonical counterparts. The simpler sentence phrasings are then transformed into variations that are more difficult to interpret. For example, many individuals who have expressive aphasia struggle with Wh- sentences. \"What\" and \"who\" questions are problematic sentences that this treatment method attempts to improve, and they are also two interrogative particles that are strongly related to each other because they reorder arguments from the declarative counterparts. For instance, therapists have used sentences like, \"Who is the boy helping?\" and \"What is the boy fixing?\" because both verbs are transitive- they require two arguments in the form of a subject and a direct object, but not necessarily an indirect object. In addition, certain question particles are linked together based on how the reworded sentence is formed. Training \"who\" sentences increased the generalizations of non-trained \"who\" sentences as well as untrained \"what\" sentences, and vice versa. Likewise, \"where\" and \"when\" question types are very closely linked. \"What\" and \"who\" questions alter placement of arguments, and \"where\" and \"when\" sentences move adjunct phrases. Training is in the style of: \"The man parked the car in the driveway. What did the man park in the driveway?\" Sentence training goes on in this manner for more domains, such as clefts and sentence voice.\nResults: Patients\u2019 use of sentence types used in the TUF treatment will improve, subjects will generalize sentences of similar category to those used for treatment in TUF, and results are applied to real-world conversations with others. Generalization of sentence types used can be improved when the treatment progresses in the order of more complex sentences to more elementary sentences. Treatment has been shown to affect on-line (real-time) processing of trained sentences and these results can be tracked using fMRI mappings. Training of Wh- sentences has led improvements in three main areas of discourse for aphasics: increased average length of utterances, higher proportions of grammatical sentences, and larger ratios of numbers of verbs to nouns produced. Patients also showed improvements in verb argument structure productions and assigned thematic roles to words in utterances with more accuracy. In terms of on-line sentence processing, patients having undergone this treatment discriminate between anomalous and non-anomalous sentences with more accuracy than control groups and are closer to levels of normalcy than patients not having participated in this treatment.\nMechanisms of recovery.\nMechanisms for recovery differ from patient to patient. Some mechanisms for recovery occur spontaneously after damage to the brain, whereas others are caused by the effects of language therapy. FMRI studies have shown that recovery can be partially attributed to the activation of tissue around the damaged area and the recruitment of new neurons in these areas to compensate for the lost function. Recovery may also be caused in very acute lesions by a return of blood flow and function to damaged tissue that has not died around an injured area. It has been stated by some researchers that the recruitment and recovery of neurons in the left hemisphere opposed to the recruitment of similar neurons in the right hemisphere is superior for long-term recovery and continued rehabilitation. It is thought that, because the right hemisphere is not intended for full language function, using the right hemisphere as a mechanism of recovery is effectively a \"dead-end\" and can lead only to partial recovery.\nIt has been proven that, among all types of therapies, one of the most important factors and best predictors for a successful outcome is the intensity of the therapy. By comparing the length and intensity of various methods of therapies, it was proven that intensity is a better predictor of recovery than the method of therapy used.\nPrognosis.\nIn most individuals with expressive aphasia, the majority of recovery is seen within the first year following a stroke or injury. The majority of this improvement is seen in the first four weeks in therapy following a stroke and slows thereafter. However, this timeline will vary depending upon the type of stroke experienced by the patient. Patients who experienced an ischemic stroke may recover in the days and weeks following the stroke, and then experience a plateau and gradual slowing of recovery. On the contrary, patients who experienced a hemorrhagic stroke experience a slower recovery in the first 4\u20138 weeks, followed by a faster recovery which eventually stabilizes.\nNumerous factors impact the recovery process and outcomes. Site and extent of lesion greatly impacts recovery. Other factors that may affect prognosis are age, education, gender, and motivation. Occupation, handedness, personality, and emotional state may also be associated with recovery outcomes.\nStudies have also found that prognosis of expressive aphasia correlates strongly with the initial severity of impairment. However, it has been seen that continued recovery is possible years after a stroke with effective treatment. Timing and intensity of treatment is another factor that impacts outcomes. Research suggests that even in later stages of recovery, intervention is effective at improving function, as well as, preventing loss of function.\nUnlike receptive aphasia, patients with expressive aphasia are aware of their errors in language production. This may further motivate a person with expressive aphasia to progress in treatment, which would affect treatment outcomes. On the other hand, awareness of impairment may lead to higher levels of frustration, depression, anxiety, or social withdrawal, which have been proven to negatively affect a person's chance of recovery.\nHistory.\nExpressive aphasia was first identified by the French neurologist Paul Broca. By examining the brains of deceased individuals having acquired expressive aphasia in life, he concluded that language ability is localized in the ventroposterior region of the frontal lobe. One of the most important aspects of Paul Broca's discovery was the observation that the loss of proper speech in expressive aphasia is due to the brain's loss of ability to produce language, as opposed to the mouth's loss of ability to produce words.\nThe discoveries of Paul Broca were made during the same period of time as the German Neurologist Carl Wernicke, who was also studying brains of aphasiacs post-mortem and identified the region now known as Wernicke's area. Discoveries of both men contributed to the concept of localization, which states that specific brain functions are all localized to a specific area of the brain. While both men made significant contributions to the field of aphasia, it was Carl Wernicke who realized the difference between patients with aphasia that could not produce language and those that could not comprehend language (the essential difference between expressive and receptive aphasia)."}
{"id": "9843", "revid": "3062783", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9843", "title": "Ephesus", "text": "Ephesus (; ; ; may ultimately derive from ) was an ancient Greek city on the coast of Ionia, three kilometres southwest of present-day Sel\u00e7uk in \u0130zmir Province, Turkey. It was built in the 10th century BC on the site of the former Arzawan capital by Attic and Ionian Greek colonists. During the Classical Greek era it was one of the twelve cities of the Ionian League. The city came under the control of the Roman Republic in 129 BC.\nThe city was famed for the nearby Temple of Artemis (completed around 550\u00a0BC), one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Among many other monumental buildings are the Library of Celsus, and a theatre capable of holding 25,000 spectators.\nEphesus was one of the seven churches of Asia that are cited in the Book of Revelation. The Gospel of John may have been written here. The city was the site of several \n5th-century Christian Councils (see Council of Ephesus). The city was destroyed by the Goths in 263, and although rebuilt, the city's importance as a commercial centre declined as the harbour was slowly silted up by the K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckmenderes River. It was partially destroyed by an earthquake in AD 614. The ruins of Ephesus are a favourite international and local tourist attraction, partly owing to their easy access from Adnan Menderes Airport or from the cruise ship port of Ku\u015fadas\u0131, some 30\u00a0km to the South.\nIt was added as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2015.\nHistory.\nNeolithic age.\nThe area surrounding Ephesus was already inhabited during the Neolithic Age (about 6000\u00a0BC), as was revealed by excavations at the nearby \"h\u00f6y\u00fck\" (artificial mounds known as tells) of Arvalya and Cukurici.\nBronze Age.\nExcavations in recent years have unearthed settlements from the early Bronze Age at Ayasuluk Hill. According to Hittite sources, the capital of the Kingdom of Arzawa (another independent state in Western and Southern Anatolia/Asia Minor) was Apasa (or \"Abasa\"). Some scholars suggest that this is the later Greek Ephesus. In 1954, a burial ground from the Mycenaean era (1500\u20131400\u00a0BC) with ceramic pots was discovered close to the ruins of the basilica of St. John. This was the period of the Mycenaean Expansion when the \"Achaioi\" (as they were called by Homer) settled in Asia Minor during the 14th and 13th centuries BC. The names \"Apasa\" and \"Ephesus\" appear to be cognate, and recently found inscriptions seem to pinpoint the places in the Hittite record.\nPeriod of Greek migrations.\nEphesus was founded as an Attic-Ionian colony in the 10th century BC on a hill (now known as the Ayasuluk Hill), three kilometers () from the centre of ancient Ephesus (as attested by excavations at the Seljuk castle during the 1990s). The mythical founder of the city was a prince of Athens named Androklos, who had to leave his country after the death of his father, King Kodros. According to the legend, he founded Ephesus on the place where the oracle of Delphi became reality (\"A fish and a boar will show you the way\"). Androklos drove away most of the native Carian and Lelegian inhabitants of the city and united his people with the remainder. He was a successful warrior, and as a king he was able to join the twelve cities of Ionia together into the Ionian League. During his reign the city began to prosper. He died in a battle against the Carians when he came to the aid of Priene, another city of the Ionian League. Androklos and his dog are depicted on the Hadrian temple frieze, dating from the 2nd century. Later, Greek historians such as Pausanias, Strabo and Herodotos and the poet Kallinos reassigned the city's mythological foundation to Ephos, queen of the Amazons.\nThe Greek goddess Artemis and the great Anatolian goddess Kybele were identified together as \"Artemis of Ephesus\". The many-breasted \"Lady of Ephesus\", identified with Artemis, was venerated in the Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the World and the largest building of the ancient world according to Pausanias (4.31.8). Pausanias mentions that the temple was built by Ephesus, son of the river god Caystrus, before the arrival of the Ionians. Of this structure, scarcely a trace remains.\nAncient sources seem to indicate that an older name of the place was Alope ().\nArchaic period.\nAbout 650\u00a0BC, Ephesus was attacked by the Cimmerians who razed the city, including the temple of Artemis. After the Cimmerians had been driven away, the city was ruled by a series of tyrants. Following a revolt by the people, Ephesus was ruled by a council. The city prospered again under a new rule, producing a number of important historical figures such as the elegiac poet Callinus and the iambic poet Hipponax, the philosopher Heraclitus, the great painter Parrhasius and later the grammarian Zenodotos and physicians Soranus and Rufus.\nAbout 560\u00a0BC, Ephesus was conquered by the Lydians under king Croesus, who, though a harsh ruler, treated the inhabitants with respect and even became the main contributor to the reconstruction of the temple of Artemis. His signature has been found on the base of one of the columns of the temple (now on display in the British Museum). Croesus made the populations of the different settlements around Ephesus regroup (\"synoikismos\") in the vicinity of the Temple of Artemis, enlarging the city.\nLater in the same century, the Lydians under Croesus invaded Persia. The Ionians refused a peace offer from Cyrus the Great, siding with the Lydians instead. After the Persians defeated Croesus, the Ionians offered to make peace, but Cyrus insisted that they surrender and become part of the empire. They were defeated by the Persian army commander Harpagos in 547\u00a0BC. The Persians then incorporated the Greek cities of Asia Minor into the Achaemenid Empire. Those cities were then ruled by satraps.\nEphesus has intrigued archaeologists because for the Archaic Period there is no definite location for the settlement. There are numerous sites to suggest the movement of a settlement between the Bronze Age and the Roman period, but the silting up of the natural harbours as well as the movement of the Kayster River meant that the location never remained the same.\nClassical period.\nEphesus continued to prosper, but when taxes were raised under Cambyses II and Darius, the Ephesians participated in the Ionian Revolt against Persian rule in the Battle of Ephesus (498\u00a0BC), an event which instigated the Greco-Persian wars. In 479\u00a0BC, the Ionians, together with Athens, were able to oust the Persians from the shores of Asia Minor. In 478\u00a0BC, the Ionian cities with Athens entered into the Delian League against the Persians. Ephesus did not contribute ships but gave financial support.\nDuring the Peloponnesian War, Ephesus was first allied to Athens but in a later phase, called the Decelean War, or the Ionian War, sided with Sparta, which also had received the support of the Persians. As a result, rule over the cities of Ionia was ceded again to Persia.\nThese wars did not greatly affect daily life in Ephesus. The Ephesians were surprisingly modern in their social relations: they allowed strangers to integrate and education was valued. In later times, Pliny the Elder mentioned having seen at Ephesus a representation of the goddess Diana by Timarete, the daughter of a painter.\nIn 356\u00a0BC the temple of Artemis was burnt down, according to legend, by a lunatic called Herostratus. The inhabitants of Ephesus at once set about restoring the temple and even planned a larger and grander one than the original.\nHellenistic period.\nWhen Alexander the Great defeated the Persian forces at the Battle of Granicus in 334\u00a0BC, the Greek cities of Asia Minor were liberated. The pro-Persian tyrant Syrpax and his family were stoned to death, and Alexander was greeted warmly when he entered Ephesus in triumph. When Alexander saw that the temple of Artemis was not yet finished, he proposed to finance it and have his name inscribed on the front. But the inhabitants of Ephesus demurred, claiming that it was not fitting for one god to build a temple to another. After Alexander's death in 323\u00a0BC, Ephesus in 290\u00a0BC came under the rule of one of Alexander's generals, Lysimachus.\nAs the river Cayster (Grk. name \u039a\u03ac\u03cb\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2) silted up the old harbour, the resulting marshes caused malaria and many deaths among the inhabitants. Lysimachus forced the people to move from the ancient settlement around the temple of Artemis to the present site two kilometres () away, when as a last resort the king flooded the old city by blocking the sewers. The new settlement was officially called \"Arsinoea\" ( or \u1f08\u03c1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u0390\u03b1) or Arsinoe (\u1f08\u03c1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd\u03cc\u03b7), after the king's second wife, Arsinoe II of Egypt. After Lysimachus had destroyed the nearby cities of Lebedos and Colophon in 292\u00a0BC, he relocated their inhabitants to the new city.\nEphesus revolted after the treacherous death of Agathocles, giving the Hellenistic king of Syria and Mesopotamia Seleucus I Nicator an opportunity for removing and killing Lysimachus, his last rival, at the Battle of Corupedium in 281\u00a0BC. After the death of Lysimachus the town again was named Ephesus.\nThus Ephesus became part of the Seleucid Empire. After the murder of king Antiochus II Theos and his Egyptian wife, pharaoh Ptolemy III invaded the Seleucid Empire and the Egyptian fleet swept the coast of Asia Minor. Ephesus came under Egyptian rule between 263 and 197\u00a0BC.\nThe Seleucid king Antiochus III the Great tried to regain the Greek cities of Asia Minor and recaptured Ephesus in 196\u00a0BC but he then came into conflict with Rome. After a series of battles, he was defeated by Scipio Asiaticus at the Battle of Magnesia in 190\u00a0BC. As a result of the subsequent Treaty of Apamea, Ephesus came under the rule of Eumenes II, the Attalid king of Pergamon, (ruled 197\u2013159\u00a0BC). When his grandson Attalus III died in 133\u00a0BC without male children of his own, he left his kingdom to the Roman Republic, on condition that the city of Pergamon be kept free and autonomous.\nRoman period.\nEphesus, as part of the kingdom of Pergamon, became a subject of the Roman Republic in 129 BC after the revolt of Eumenes III was suppressed.\nThe city felt Roman influence at once; taxes rose considerably, and the treasures of the city were systematically plundered. Hence in 88\u00a0BC Ephesus welcomed Archelaus, a general of Mithridates, king of Pontus, when he conquered Asia (the Roman name for western Asia Minor). From Ephesus, Mithridates ordered every Roman citizen in the province to be killed which led to the Asiatic Vespers, the slaughter of 80,000 Roman citizens in Asia, or any person who spoke with a Latin accent. Many had lived in Ephesus, and statues and monument of Roman citizens in Ephesus were also destroyed. But when they saw how badly the people of Chios had been treated by Zenobius, a general of Mithridates, they refused entry to his army. Zenobius was invited into the city to visit Philopoemen, the father of Monime, the favourite wife of Mithridates, and the overseer of Ephesus. As the people expected nothing good of him, they threw him into prison and murdered him. Mithridates took revenge and inflicted terrible punishments. However, the Greek cities were given freedom and several substantial rights. Ephesus became, for a short time, self-governing. When Mithridates was defeated in the First Mithridatic War by the Roman consul Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Ephesus came back under Roman rule in 86\u00a0BC. Sulla imposed a huge indemnity, along with five years of back taxes, which left Asian cities heavily in debt for a long time to come.\nKing Ptolemy XII Auletes of Egypt retired to Ephesus in 57 BC, passing his time in the sanctuary of the temple of Artemis when the Roman Senate failed to restore him to his throne.\nMark Antony was welcomed by Ephesus for periods when he was proconsul and in 33 BC with Cleopatra when he gathered his fleet of 800 ships before the battle of Actium with Octavius.\nWhen Augustus became emperor in 27\u00a0BC, the most important change was when he made Ephesus the capital of proconsular Asia (which covered western Asia Minor) instead of Pergamum. Ephesus then entered an era of prosperity, becoming both the seat of the governor and a major centre of commerce. According to Strabo, it was second in importance and size only to Rome.\nThe city and temple were destroyed by the Goths in 263\u00a0AD. This marked the decline of the city's splendour. However emperor Constantine the Great rebuilt much of the city and erected new public baths.\nThe Roman population.\nUntil recently the population of Ephesus in Roman times was estimated to number up to 225,000 people by Broughton. More recent scholarship regards these estimates as unrealistic. Such a large estimate would require population densities seen in only a few ancient cities, or extensive settlement outside the city walls. This would have been impossible at Ephesus because of the mountain ranges, coastline and quarries which surrounded the city.\nThe wall of Lysimachus has been estimated to enclose an area of . Not all of this area was inhabited due to public buildings and spaces in the centre and the steep slope of the B\u00fclb\u00fcl Da\u011f\u0131 mountain, which was enclosed by the wall. Ludwig Burchner estimated this area with the walls at 1000.5 acres. Jerome Murphy-O'Connor uses an estimate of 345 hectares for the inhabited land or 835 acres (Murphey cites Ludwig Burchner). He cites Josiah Russell using 832 acres and Old Jerusalem in 1918 as the yardstick estimated the population at 51,068 at 14.85 persons per thousand square meters. Using 51 persons per thousand square meters he arrives at a population between 138,000 and 172,500. J. W. Hanson estimated the inhabited space to be smaller at . He argues that population densities of 150 or 250 people per hectare (100 per acre) are more realistic which gives a range of 33,600 to 56,000 inhabitants. Even with these much lower population estimates, Ephesus was one of the largest cities of Roman Asia Minor, ranking it as the largest city after Sardis and Alexandria Troas. By contrast Rome within the walls encompassed 1500 hectares = 3,600 acres with a population estimated to between 750,000 and one million (over 1000 built-up acres were left outside the Aurelian Wall whose construction was begun in 274 and finished in 279) or 208 to 277 inhabitants per acres including open and public spaces.\nByzantine era (395\u20131308 AD).\nEphesus remained the most important city of the Byzantine Empire in Asia after Constantinople in the 5th and 6th centuries. Emperor Flavius Arcadius raised the level of the street between the theatre and the harbour. The basilica of St. John was built during the reign of emperor Justinian I in the 6th century.\nThe city was partially destroyed by an earthquake in 614 AD.\nThe importance of the city as a commercial centre declined as the harbour was slowly silted up by the river (today, K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fck Menderes) despite repeated dredging during the city's history. (Today, the harbour is 5\u00a0kilometres inland). The loss of its harbour caused Ephesus to lose its access to the Aegean Sea, which was important for trade. People started leaving the lowland of the city for the surrounding hills. The ruins of the temples were used as building blocks for new homes. Marble sculptures were ground to powder to make lime for plaster.\nSackings by the Arabs first in the year 654\u2013655 by caliph Muawiyah I, and later in 700 and 716 hastened the decline further.\nWhen the Seljuk Turks conquered Ephesus in 1090, it was a small village. The Byzantines resumed control in 1097 and changed the name of the town to Hagios Theologos. They kept control of the region until 1308. Crusaders passing through were surprised that there was only a small village, called Ayasalouk, where they had expected a bustling city with a large seaport. Even the temple of Artemis was completely forgotten by the local population. The Crusaders of the Second Crusade fought the Seljuks just outside the town in December 1147.\nPre-Ottoman era (1304\u20131390).\nThe town surrendered, on 24 October 1304, to Sasa Bey, a Turkish warlord of the Mente\u015fo\u011fullar\u0131 principality. Nevertheless, contrary to the terms of the surrender the Turks pillaged the church of Saint John and deported most of the local population to Thyrea, Greece when a revolt seemed probable. During these events many of the remaining inhabitants were massacred.\nShortly afterwards, Ephesus was ceded to the Aydinid principality that stationed a powerful navy in the harbour of Ayasulu\u011f (the present-day Sel\u00e7uk, next to Ephesus). Ayasoluk became an important harbour, from which piratical raids to the surrounding Christian regions were organised, both official by the state and private.\nThe town knew again a short period of prosperity during the 14th century under these new Seljuk rulers. They added important architectural works such as the \u0130sa Bey Mosque, caravansaries and Turkish bathhouses (hamam).\nOttoman era.\nEphesians were incorporated as vassals into the Ottoman Empire for the first time in 1390. The Central Asian warlord Tamerlane defeated the Ottomans in Anatolia in 1402, and the Ottoman sultan Bayezid I died in captivity. The region was restored to the Anatolian beyliks. After a period of unrest, the region was again incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1425.\nEphesus was completely abandoned by the 15th century. Nearby Ayasulu\u011f was renamed Sel\u00e7uk in 1914.\nEphesus and Christianity.\nEphesus was an important centre for Early Christianity from the AD 50s. From AD 52\u201354, the apostle Paul lived in Ephesus, working with the congregation and apparently organizing missionary activity into the hinterlands. Initially, according to the Acts of the Apostles, Paul attended the Jewish synagogue in Ephesus, but after three months he became frustrated with the stubbornness or hardness of heart of some of the Jews, and moved his base to the school of Tyrannus. The Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary reminds readers that the unbelief of \"some\" () implies that \"others, probably a large number, believed\" and therefore there must have been a community of Jewish Christians in Ephesus. Paul introduced about twelve men to the 'baptism with the Holy Spirit' who had previously only experienced the baptism of John the Baptist. Later a silversmith named Demetrios stirred up a mob against Paul, saying that he was endangering the livelihood of those making silver Artemis shrines. Demetrios in connexion with the temple of Artemis mentions some object (perhaps an image or a stone) \"fallen from Zeus\". Between 53 and 57\u00a0AD Paul wrote the letter 1 Corinthians from Ephesus (possibly from the 'Paul tower' near the harbour, where he was imprisoned for a short time). Later, Paul wrote the Epistle to the Ephesians while he was in prison in Rome (around 62\u00a0AD).\nRoman Asia was associated with John, one of the chief apostles, and the Gospel of John might have been written in Ephesus, \"c\" 90\u2013100. Ephesus was one of the seven cities addressed in the Book of Revelation, indicating that the church at Ephesus was strong.\nAccording to Eusebius of Caesarea, Saint Timothy was the first bishop of Ephesus.\nPolycrates of Ephesus () was a bishop at the Church of Ephesus in the 2nd century. He is best known for his letter addressed to the Pope Victor I, Bishop of Rome, defending the Quartodeciman position in the Easter controversy.\nIn the early 2nd century AD, the church at Ephesus was still important enough to be addressed by a letter written by Bishop Ignatius of Antioch to the Ephesians which begins with \"Ignatius, who is also called Theophorus, to the Church which is at Ephesus, in Asia, deservedly most happy, being blessed in the greatness and fullness of God the Father, and predestinated before the beginning of time, that it should be always for an enduring and unchangeable glory\" (\"Letter to the Ephesians\"). The church at Ephesus had given their support for Ignatius, who was taken to Rome for execution.\nA legend, which was first mentioned by Epiphanius of Salamis in the 4th century AD, purported that the Virgin Mary may have spent the last years of her life in Ephesus. The Ephesians derived the argument from John's presence in the city, and Jesus\u2019 instructions to John to take care of his mother, Mary, after his death. Epiphanius, however, was keen to point out that, while the Bible says John was leaving for Asia, it does not say specifically that Mary went with him. He later stated that she was buried in Jerusalem. Since the 19th century, The House of the Virgin Mary, about from Sel\u00e7uk, has been considered to have been the last home of Mary, mother of Jesus in the Roman Catholic tradition, based on the visions of Augustinian sister the Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich (1774-1824). It is a popular place of Catholic pilgrimage which has been visited by three recent popes.\nThe Church of Mary near the harbour of Ephesus was the setting for the Third Ecumenical Council in 431, which resulted in the condemnation of Nestorius. A Second Council of Ephesus was held in 449, but its controversial acts were never approved by the Catholics. It came to be called the Robber Council of Ephesus or Robber Synod of Latrocinium by its opponents.\nMain sites.\nEphesus is one of the largest Roman archaeological sites in the eastern Mediterranean. The visible ruins still give some idea of the city's original splendour, and the names associated with the ruins are evocative of its former life. The theatre dominates the view down Harbour Street, which leads to the silted-up harbour.\nThe Temple of Artemis, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, once stood 418' by 239' with over 100 marble pillars each 56' high. The temple earned the city the title \"Servant of the Goddess\". Pliny tells us that the magnificent structure took 120 years to build but is now represented only by one inconspicuous column, revealed during an archaeological excavation by the British Museum in the 1870s. Some fragments of the frieze (which are insufficient to suggest the form of the original) and other small finds were removed \u2013 some to London and some to the \u0130stanbul Archaeology Museums.\nThe Library of Celsus, the fa\u00e7ade of which has been carefully reconstructed from original pieces, was originally built c. 125\u00a0AD in memory of Tiberius Julius Celsus Polemaeanus, an Ancient Greek who served as governor of Roman Asia (105\u2013107) in the Roman Empire. Celsus paid for the construction of the library with his own personal wealth and is buried in a sarcophagus beneath it. The library was mostly built by his son Gaius Julius Aquila and once held nearly 12,000 scrolls. Designed with an exaggerated entrance \u2014 so as to enhance its perceived size, speculate many historians \u2014 the building faces east so that the reading rooms could make best use of the morning light.\nThe interior of the library measured roughly 180 square metres (2,000 square feet) and may have contained as many as 12,000 scrolls. By the year 400 C.E. the library was no longer in use after being damaged in 262 C.E. The facade was reconstructed during 1970 to 1978 using fragments found on site or copies of fragments that were previously removed to museums.\nAt an estimated 25,000 seating capacity, the theatre is believed to be the largest in the ancient world. This open-air theatre was used initially for drama, but during later Roman times gladiatorial combats were also held on its stage; the first archaeological evidence of a gladiator graveyard was found in May 2007.\nThere were two agoras, one for commercial and one for state business.\nEphesus also had several major bath complexes, built at various times while the city was under Roman rule.\nThe city had one of the most advanced aqueduct systems in the ancient world, with at least six aqueducts of various sizes supplying different areas of the city. They fed a number of water mills, one of which has been identified as a sawmill for marble.\nThe Odeon was a small roofed theatre constructed by Publius Vedius Antoninus and his wife around 150\u00a0AD. It was a small salon for plays and concerts, seating about 1,500 people. There were 22 stairs in the theatre. The upper part of the theatre was decorated with red granite pillars in the Corinthian style. The entrances were at both sides of the stage and reached by a few steps.\nThe Temple of Hadrian dates from the 2nd century but underwent repairs in the 4th century and has been reerected from the surviving architectural fragments. The reliefs in the upper sections are casts, the originals now being exhibited in the Ephesus Archaeological Museum. A number of figures are depicted in the reliefs, including the emperor Theodosius I with his wife and eldest son. The temple was depicted on the reverse of the Turkish 20\u00a0million lira banknote of 2001\u20132005 and of the 20 new lira banknote of 2005\u20132009.\nThe Temple of the Sebastoi (sometimes called the Temple of Domitian), dedicated to the Flavian dynasty, was one of the largest temples in the city. It was erected on a pseudodipteral plan with 8 \u00d7 13 columns. The temple and its statue are some of the few remains connected with Domitian.\nThe Tomb/Fountain of Pollio was erected in 97\u00a0AD in honour of C. Sextilius Pollio, who constructed the Marnas aqueduct, by Offilius Proculus. It has a concave fa\u00e7ade.\nA part of the site, Basilica of St. John, was built in the 6th century AD, under emperor Justinian I, over the supposed site of the apostle's tomb. It is now surrounded by Sel\u00e7uk.\nSeven Sleepers.\nEphesus is believed to be the city of the Seven Sleepers. The story of the Seven Sleepers, who are considered saints by Catholics and Orthodox Christians and whose story is also mentioned in the Qur'an, tells that they were persecuted because of their monotheistic belief in God and that they slept in a cave near Ephesus for centuries.\nArchaeology.\nThe history of archaeological research in Ephesus stretches back to 1863, when British architect John Turtle Wood, sponsored by the British Museum, began to search for the Artemision. In 1869 he discovered the pavement of the temple, but since further expected discoveries were not made the excavations stopped in 1874. In 1895 German archaeologist Otto Benndorf, financed by a 10,000 guilder donation made by Austrian Karl Mautner Ritter von Markhof, resumed excavations. In 1898 Benndorf founded the Austrian Archaeological Institute, which plays a leading role in Ephesus today.\nFinds from the site are exhibited notably in the Ephesos Museum in Vienna, the Ephesus Archaeological Museum in Sel\u00e7uk and in the British Museum.\nIn October 2016, Turkey halted the works of the archeologists, which had been ongoing for more than 100 years, due to tensions between Austria and Turkey. In May 2018, Turkey allowed Austrian archeologists to resume their excavations."}
{"id": "9845", "revid": "32422652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9845", "title": "JavaScript", "text": "JavaScript (), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.\nAlongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web. Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on the user's device.\nAs a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).\nThe ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.\nJavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now core components of other software systems, most notably servers and a variety of applications.\nAlthough there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.\nHistory.\nCreation at Netscape.\nThe Mosaic web browser was released in 1993. As the first browser with a graphical user interface accessible to non-technical people, it played a prominent role in the rapid growth of the nascent World Wide Web. The lead developers of Mosaic then founded the Netscape corporation, which released a more polished browser, Netscape Navigator, in 1994. Navigator quickly became the most used browser.\nDuring these formative years of the Web, web pages could only be static, lacking the capability for dynamic behavior after the page was loaded in the browser. There was a desire in the burgeoning web development scene to remove this limitation, so in 1995, Netscape decided to add a scripting language to Navigator. They pursued two routes to achieve this: collaborating with Sun Microsystems to embed the Java programming language, while also hiring Brendan Eich to embed the Scheme language.\nNetscape management soon decided that the best option was for Eich to devise a new language, with syntax similar to Java and less like Scheme or other extant scripting languages. Although the new language and its interpreter implementation were called LiveScript when first shipped as part of a Navigator beta in September 1995, the name was changed to JavaScript for the official release in December.\nThe choice of the JavaScript name has caused confusion, implying that it is directly related to Java. Since Java was the hot new programming language at the time, this has been characterized as a marketing ploy by Netscape to give its own new language cachet.\nAdoption by Microsoft.\nMicrosoft debuted Internet Explorer in 1995, leading to a browser war with Netscape. On the JavaScript front, Microsoft reverse-engineered the Navigator interpreter to create its own, called JScript.\nJScript was first released in 1996, alongside initial support for CSS and extensions to HTML. Each of these implementations was noticeably different from their counterparts in Navigator. These differences made it difficult for developers to make their websites work well in both browsers, leading to widespread use of \"best viewed in Netscape\" and \"best viewed in Internet Explorer\" logos for several years.\nThe rise of JScript.\nIn November 1996, Netscape submitted JavaScript to ECMA International, as the starting point for a standard specification that all browser vendors could conform to. This led to the official release of the first ECMAScript language specification in June 1997.\nThe standards process continued for a few years, with the release of ECMAScript 2 in June 1998 and ECMAScript 3 in December 1999. Work on ECMAScript 4 began in 2000.\nMeanwhile, Microsoft gained an increasingly dominant position in the browser market. By the early 2000s, Internet Explorer's market share reached 95%. This meant that JScript became the de facto standard for client-side scripting on the Web.\nMicrosoft initially participated in the standards process and implemented some proposals in its JScript language, but eventually it stopped collaborating on ECMA work. Thus ECMAScript 4 was mothballed.\nGrowth and standardization.\nDuring the period of Internet Explorer dominance in the early 2000s, client-side scripting was stagnant. This started to change in 2004, when the successor of Netscape, Mozilla, released the Firefox browser. Firefox was well received by many, taking significant market share from Internet Explorer.\nIn 2005, Mozilla joined ECMA International, and work started on the ECMAScript for XML (E4X) standard. This led to Mozilla working jointly with Macromedia (later acquired by Adobe Systems), who were implementing E4X in their ActionScript 3 language, which was based on an ECMAScript 4 draft. The goal became standardizing ActionScript 3 as the new ECMAScript 4. To this end, Adobe Systems released the Tamarin implementation as an open source project. However, Tamarin and ActionScript 3 were too different from established client-side scripting, and without cooperation from Microsoft, ECMAScript 4 never reached fruition.\nMeanwhile, very important developments were occurring in open-source communities not affiliated with ECMA work. In 2005, Jesse James Garrett released a white paper in which he coined the term Ajax and described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, to create web applications where data can be loaded in the background, avoiding the need for full page reloads. This sparked a renaissance period of JavaScript, spearheaded by open-source libraries and the communities that formed around them. Many new libraries were created, including jQuery, Prototype, Dojo Toolkit, and MooTools.\nGoogle debuted its Chrome browser in 2008, with the V8 JavaScript engine that was faster than its competition. The key innovation was just-in-time compilation (JIT), so other browser vendors needed to overhaul their engines for JIT.\nIn July 2008, these disparate parties came together for a conference in Oslo. This led to the eventual agreement in early 2009 to combine all relevant work and drive the language forward. The result was the ECMAScript 5 standard, released in December 2009.\nReaching maturity.\nAmbitious work on the language continued for several years, culminating in an extensive collection of additions and refinements being formalized with the publication of ECMAScript 6 in 2015.\nThe draft specification is currently maintained openly on GitHub, and ECMAScript editions are produced via regular annual snapshots. Potential revisions to the language are vetted through a comprehensive proposal process. Now, instead of edition numbers, developers check the status of upcoming features individually.\nThe current JavaScript ecosystem has many libraries and frameworks, established programming practices, and increased usage of JavaScript outside of web browsers. Plus, with the rise of single-page applications and other JavaScript-heavy websites, a number of transpilers have been created to aid the development process.\nTrademark.\n\"JavaScript\" is a trademark of Oracle Corporation in the United States.\nWebsite client-side usage.\nJavaScript is the dominant client-side scripting language of the Web, with 97% of websites using it for this purpose. Scripts are embedded in or included from HTML documents and interact with the DOM. All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the user's device.\nLibraries and frameworks.\nOver 80% of websites use a third-party JavaScript library or web framework for their client-side scripting.\njQuery is by far the most popular library, used by over 75% of websites. Facebook created the React library for its website and later released it as open source; other sites, including Twitter, now use it. Likewise, the Angular framework created by Google for its websites, including YouTube and Gmail, is now an open source project used by others.\nIn contrast, the term \"Vanilla JS\" has been coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.\nOther usage.\nThe use of JavaScript has expanded beyond its web browser roots. JavaScript engines are now embedded in a variety of other software systems, both for server-side website deployments and non-browser applications. \nInitial attempts at promoting server-side JavaScript usage were Netscape Enterprise Server and Microsoft's Internet Information Services, but they were small niches. Server-side usage eventually started to grow in the late 2000s, with the creation of Node.js and other approaches.\nElectron, Cordova, React Native, and other application frameworks have been used to create many applications with behavior implemented in JavaScript. Other non-browser applications include Adobe Acrobat support for scripting PDF documents and GNOME Shell extensions written in JavaScript.\nJavaScript has recently begun to appear in some embedded systems, usually by leveraging Node.js.\nFeatures.\nThe following features are common to all conforming ECMAScript implementations, unless explicitly specified otherwise.\nImperative and structured.\nJavaScript supports much of the structured programming syntax from C (e.g., codice_1 statements, codice_2 loops, codice_3 statements, codice_4 loops, etc.). One partial exception is scoping: originally JavaScript only had function scoping with codice_5; then block scoping was added in ECMAScript 2015 with the keywords codice_6 and codice_7. Like C, JavaScript makes a distinction between expressions and statements. One syntactic difference from C is automatic semicolon insertion, which allow semicolons (which terminate statements) to be omitted.\nWeakly typed.\nJavaScript is weakly typed, which means certain types are implicitly cast depending on the operation used.\nValues are cast to strings like the following:\nValues are cast to numbers by casting to strings and then casting the strings to numbers. These processes can be modified by defining codice_15 and codice_16 functions on the prototype for string and number casting respectively. \nJavaScript has received criticism for the way it implements these conversions as the complexity of the rules can be mistaken for inconsistency. For example, when adding a number to a string, the number will be cast to a string before performing concatenation, but when subtracting a number from a string, the string is cast to a number before performing subtraction.\nOften also mentioned is codice_17 resulting in codice_18 (number). This is misleading: the codice_19 is interpreted as an empty code block instead of an empty object, and the empty array is cast to a number by the remaining unary codice_8 operator. If you wrap the expression in parentheses codice_21 the curly brackets are interpreted as an empty object and the result of the expression is codice_22 as expected.\nObject-orientation (prototype-based).\nPrototypal inheritance in JavaScript is described by Douglas Crockford as: \nIn JavaScript, an object is an associative array, augmented with a prototype (see below); each key provides the name for an object property, and there are two syntactical ways to specify such a name: dot notation (codice_24) and bracket notation (codice_25). A property may be added, rebound, or deleted at run-time. Most properties of an object (and any property that belongs to an object's prototype inheritance chain) can be enumerated using a codice_26 loop.\nFunctional.\nA function is first-class; a function is considered to be an object. As such, a function may have properties and methods, such as codice_36 and codice_37. A \"nested\" function is a function defined within another function. It is created each time the outer function is invoked. In addition, each nested function forms a lexical closure: The lexical scope of the outer function (including any constant, local variable, or argument value) becomes part of the internal state of each inner function object, even after execution of the outer function concludes. JavaScript also supports anonymous functions.\nDelegative.\nJavaScript supports implicit and explicit delegation.\nMiscellaneous.\nJS is a zero-index language.\nVendor-specific extensions.\nHistorically, some JavaScript engines supported these non-standard features:\nSyntax.\nSimple examples.\nVariables in JavaScript can be defined using either the codice_5, codice_6 or codice_7 keywords.\n// Declares a function-scoped variable named `x`, and implicitly assigns the\n// special value `undefined` to it. Variables without value are automatically\n// set to undefined.\nvar x;\n// Variables can be manually set to `undefined` like so\nvar x2 = undefined;\n// Declares a block-scoped variable named `y`, and implicitly sets it to\n// `undefined`. The `let` keyword was introduced in ECMAScript 2015.\nlet y;\n// Declares a block-scoped, un-reassignable variable named `z`, and sets it to\n// a string literal. The `const` keyword was also introduced in ECMAScript 2015,\n// and must be explicitly assigned to.\n// The keyword `const` means constant, hence the variable cannot be reassigned\n// as the value is `constant`.\nconst z = \"this value cannot be reassigned!\";\n// Declares a variable named `myNumber`, and assigns a number literal (the value\n// `2`) to it.\nlet myNumber = 2;\n// Reassigns `myNumber`, setting it to a string literal (the value `\"foo\"`).\n// JavaScript is a dynamically-typed language, so this is legal.\nmyNumber = \"foo\";\nNote the comments in the example above, all of which were preceded with two forward slashes.\nThere is no built-in Input/output functionality in JavaScript; the run-time environment provides that. The ECMAScript specification in edition 5.1 mentions:\nindeed, there are no provisions in this specification for input of external data or output of computed results.\nHowever, most runtime environments have a codice_50 object that can be used to print output. Here is a minimalist Hello World program in JavaScript:\nconsole.log(\"Hello World!\");\nA simple recursive function:\nfunction factorial(n) {\n if (n === 0)\n return 1; // 0! = 1\n return n * factorial(n - 1);\nfactorial(3); // returns 6\nAn anonymous function (or lambda):\nfunction counter() {\n let count = 0;\n return function() {\n return ++count;\nlet closure = counter();\nclosure(); // returns 1\nclosure(); // returns 2\nclosure(); // returns 3\nThis example shows that, in JavaScript, function closures capture their non-local variables by reference.\nArrow functions were first introduced in 6th Edition - ECMAScript 2015. They shorten the syntax for writing functions in JavaScript. Arrow functions are anonymous in nature; a variable is needed to refer to them in order to invoke them after their creation.\nExample of arrow function:\n// Arrow functions let us omit the `function` keyword.\n// Here `long_example` points to an anonymous function value.\nconst long_example = (input1, input2) =&gt; {\n console.log(\"Hello, World!\");\n const output = input1 + input2;\n return output;\n// If there are no braces, the arrow function simply returns the expression\n// So here it's (input1 + input2)\nconst short_example = (input1, input2) =&gt; input1 + input2;\nlong_example(2, 3); // Prints \"Hello, World!\" and returns 5\nshort_example(2, 5); // Returns 7\n// If an arrow function only has one parameter, the parentheses can be removed.\nconst no_parentheses = input =&gt; input + 2;\nno_parentheses(3); // Returns 5\nIn JavaScript, objects are created in the same way as functions; this is known as a function object.\nObject example:\nfunction Ball(r) {\n this.radius = r; // the \"r\" argument is local to the ball object\n this.area = Math.PI * (r ** 2); // parentheses don't do anything but clarify\n // objects can contain functions (\"method\")\n this.show = function() {\n drawCircle(this.radius); // references another function (that draws a circle)\nlet myBall = new Ball(5); // creates a new instance of the ball object with radius 5\nmyBall.radius++; // object properties can usually be modified from the outside\nmyBall.show(); // using the inherited \"show\" function\nVariadic function demonstration (codice_43 is a special variable):\nfunction sum() {\n let x = 0;\n for (let i = 0; i &lt; arguments.length; ++i)\n x += arguments[i];\n return x;\nsum(1, 2); // returns 3\nsum(1, 2, 3); // returns 6\nImmediately-invoked function expressions are often used to create closures. Closures allow gathering properties and methods in a namespace and making some of them private:\nlet counter = (function() {\n let i = 0; // private property\n return { // public methods\n get: function() {\n alert(i);\n set: function(value) {\n i = value;\n increment: function() {\n alert(++i);\n };\n})(); // module\ncounter.get(); // shows 0\ncounter.set(6);\ncounter.increment(); // shows 7\ncounter.increment(); // shows 8\nExporting and Importing modules in JavaScript\nExport example:\n/* mymodule.js */\n// This function remains private, as it is not exported\nlet sum = (a, b) =&gt; {\n return a + b;\n// Export variables\nexport let name = 'Alice';\nexport let age = 23;\n// Export named functions\nexport function add(num1, num2) {\n return num1 + num2;\n// Export class\nexport class Multiplication {\n constructor(num1, num2) {\n this.num1 = num1;\n this.num2 = num2;\n add() {\n return sum(this.num1, this.num2);\nImport example:\n// Import one property\nimport { add } from './mymodule.js';\nconsole.log(add(1, 2)); // 3\n// Import multiple properties\nimport { name, age } from './mymodule.js';\nconsole.log(name, age);\n//&gt; \"Alice\", 23\n// Import all properties from a module\nimport * from './module.js'\nconsole.log(name, age);\n//&gt; \"Alice\", 23\nconsole.log(add(1,2));\n//&gt; 3\nMore advanced example.\nThis sample code displays various JavaScript features.\n/* Finds the lowest common multiple (LCM) of two numbers */\nfunction LCMCalculator(x, y) { // constructor function\n let checkInt = function(x) { // inner function\n if (x % 1 !== 0)\n throw new TypeError(x + \"is not an integer\"); // var a = mouseX\n return x;\n \n this.a = checkInt(x)\n // semicolons ^^^^ are optional, a newline is enough\n this.b = checkInt(y);\n// The prototype of object instances created by a constructor is\n// that constructor's \"prototype\" property.\nLCMCalculator.prototype = { // object literal\n constructor: LCMCalculator, // when reassigning a prototype, set the constructor property appropriately\n gcd: function() { // method that calculates the greatest common divisor\n // Euclidean algorithm:\n let a = Math.abs(this.a), b = Math.abs(this.b), t;\n if (a &lt; b) {\n // swap variables\n // t = b; b = a; a = t;\n [a, b] = [b, a]; // swap using destructuring assignment (ES6)\n while (b !== 0) {\n t = b;\n b = a % b;\n a = t;\n // Only need to calculate GCD once, so \"redefine\" this method.\n // (Actually not redefinition\u2014it's defined on the instance itself,\n // so that this.gcd refers to this \"redefinition\" instead of LCMCalculator.prototype.gcd.\n // Note that this leads to a wrong result if the LCMCalculator object members \"a\" and/or \"b\" are altered afterwards.)\n // Also, 'gcd' === \"gcd\", this['gcd'] === this.gcd\n this['gcd'] = function() {\n return a;\n return a;\n // Object property names can be specified by strings delimited by double (\") or single (') quotes.\n lcm: function() {\n // Variable names do not collide with object properties, e.g., |lcm| is not |this.lcm|.\n // not using |this.a*this.b| to avoid FP precision issues\n let lcm = this.a / this.gcd() * this.b;\n // Only need to calculate lcm once, so \"redefine\" this method.\n this.lcm = function() {\n return lcm;\n return lcm;\n toString: function() {\n return \"LCMCalculator: a = \" + this.a + \", b = \" + this.b;\n};\n// Define generic output function; this implementation only works for Web browsers\nfunction output(x) {\n document.body.appendChild(document.createTextNode(x));\n document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('br'));\n// Note: Array's map() and forEach() are defined in JavaScript 1.6.\n// They are used here to demonstrate JavaScript's inherent functional nature.\n [25, 55],\n [21, 56],\n [22, 58],\n [28, 56]\n].map(function(pair) { // array literal + mapping function\n return new LCMCalculator(pair[0], pair[1]);\n}).sort((a, b) =&gt; a.lcm() - b.lcm()) // sort with this comparative function; =&gt; is a shorthand form of a function, called \"arrow function\"\n .forEach(printResult);\nfunction printResult(obj) {\n output(obj + \", gcd = \" + obj.gcd() + \", lcm = \" + obj.lcm());\nThe following output should be displayed in the browser window.\nLCMCalculator: a = 28, b = 56, gcd = 28, lcm = 56\nLCMCalculator: a = 21, b = 56, gcd = 7, lcm = 168\nLCMCalculator: a = 25, b = 55, gcd = 5, lcm = 275\nLCMCalculator: a = 22, b = 58, gcd = 2, lcm = 638\nSecurity.\nJavaScript and the DOM provide the potential for malicious authors to deliver scripts to run on a client computer via the Web. Browser authors minimize this risk using two restrictions. First, scripts run in a sandbox in which they can only perform Web-related actions, not general-purpose programming tasks like creating files. Second, scripts are constrained by the same-origin policy: scripts from one Web site do not have access to information such as usernames, passwords, or cookies sent to another site. Most JavaScript-related security bugs are breaches of either the same origin policy or the sandbox.\nThere are subsets of general JavaScript\u2014ADsafe, Secure ECMAScript (SES)\u2014that provide greater levels of security, especially on code created by third parties (such as advertisements). Caja is another project for safe embedding and isolation of third-party JavaScript and HTML.\nContent Security Policy is the main intended method of ensuring that only trusted code is executed on a Web page.\nCross-site vulnerabilities.\nA common JavaScript-related security problem is cross-site scripting (XSS), a violation of the same-origin policy. XSS vulnerabilities occur when an attacker is able to cause a target Web site, such as an online banking website, to include a malicious script in the webpage presented to a victim. The script in this example can then access the banking application with the privileges of the victim, potentially disclosing secret information or transferring money without the victim's authorization. A solution to XSS vulnerabilities is to use \"HTML escaping\" whenever displaying untrusted data.\nSome browsers include partial protection against \"reflected\" XSS attacks, in which the attacker provides a URL including malicious script. However, even users of those browsers are vulnerable to other XSS attacks, such as those where the malicious code is stored in a database. Only correct design of Web applications on the server side can fully prevent XSS.\nXSS vulnerabilities can also occur because of implementation mistakes by browser authors.\nAnother cross-site vulnerability is cross-site request forgery (CSRF). In CSRF, code on an attacker's site tricks the victim's browser into taking actions the user did not intend at a target site (like transferring money at a bank). When target sites rely solely on cookies for request authentication, requests originating from code on the attacker's site can carry the same valid login credentials of the initiating user. In general, the solution to CSRF is to require an authentication value in a hidden form field, and not only in the cookies, to authenticate any request that might have lasting effects. Checking the HTTP Referrer header can also help.\n\"JavaScript hijacking\" is a type of CSRF attack in which a codice_42 tag on an attacker's site exploits a page on the victim's site that returns private information such as JSON or JavaScript. Possible solutions include:\nMisplaced trust in the client.\nDevelopers of client-server applications must recognize that untrusted clients may be under the control of attackers. The application author cannot assume that their JavaScript code will run as intended (or at all) because any secret embedded in the code could be extracted by a determined adversary. Some implications are:\nMisplaced trust in developers.\nPackage management systems such as npm and Bower are popular with JavaScript developers. Such systems allow a developer to easily manage their program's dependencies upon other developer's program libraries. Developers trust that the maintainers of the libraries will keep them secure and up to date, but that is not always the case. A vulnerability has emerged because of this blind trust. Relied-upon libraries can have new releases that cause bugs or vulnerabilities to appear in all programs that rely upon the libraries. Inversely, a library can go unpatched with known vulnerabilities out in the wild. In a study done looking over a sample of 133k websites, researchers found 37% of the websites included a library with at least one known vulnerability. \"The median lag between the oldest library version used on each website and the newest available version of that library is 1,177 days in ALEXA, and development of some libraries still in active use ceased years ago.\" Another possibility is that the maintainer of a library may remove the library entirely. This occurred in March 2016 when Azer Ko\u00e7ulu removed his repository from npm. This caused all tens of thousands of programs and websites depending upon his libraries to break.\nBrowser and plugin coding errors.\nJavaScript provides an interface to a wide range of browser capabilities, some of which may have flaws such as buffer overflows. These flaws can allow attackers to write scripts that would run any code they wish on the user's system. This code is not by any means limited to another JavaScript application. For example, a buffer overrun exploit can allow an attacker to gain access to the operating system's API with superuser privileges.\nThese flaws have affected major browsers including Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari.\nPlugins, such as video players, Adobe Flash, and the wide range of ActiveX controls enabled by default in Microsoft Internet Explorer, may also have flaws exploitable via JavaScript (such flaws have been exploited in the past).\nIn Windows Vista, Microsoft has attempted to contain the risks of bugs such as buffer overflows by running the Internet Explorer process with limited privileges. Google Chrome similarly confines its page renderers to their own \"sandbox\".\nSandbox implementation errors.\nWeb browsers are capable of running JavaScript outside the sandbox, with the privileges necessary to, for example, create or delete files. Such privileges are not intended to be granted to code from the Web.\nIncorrectly granting privileges to JavaScript from the Web has played a role in vulnerabilities in both Internet Explorer and Firefox. In Windows XP Service Pack 2, Microsoft demoted JScript's privileges in Internet Explorer.\nMicrosoft Windows allows JavaScript source files on a computer's hard drive to be launched as general-purpose, non-sandboxed programs (see: Windows Script Host). This makes JavaScript (like VBScript) a theoretically viable vector for a Trojan horse, although JavaScript Trojan horses are uncommon in practice.\nHardware vulnerabilities.\nIn 2015, a JavaScript-based proof-of-concept implementation of a rowhammer attack was described in a paper by security researchers.\nIn 2017, a JavaScript-based attack via browser was demonstrated that could bypass ASLR. It's called \"ASLR\u2295Cache\" or AnC.\nIn 2018, the paper that announced the Spectre attacks against Speculative Execution in Intel and other processors included a JavaScript implementation.\nDevelopment tools.\nImportant tools have evolved with the language.\nRelated technologies.\nJava.\nA common misconception is that JavaScript is similar or closely related to Java. It is true that both have a C-like syntax (the C language being their most immediate common ancestor language). They also are both typically sandboxed (when used inside a browser), and JavaScript was designed with Java's syntax and standard library in mind. In particular, all Java keywords were reserved in original JavaScript, JavaScript's standard library follows Java's naming conventions, and JavaScript's and objects are based on classes from Java 1.0, but the similarities end there.\nJava and JavaScript both first appeared in 1995, but Java was developed by James Gosling of Sun Microsystems, and JavaScript by Brendan Eich of Netscape Communications.\nThe differences between the two languages are more prominent than their similarities. Java has static typing, while JavaScript's typing is dynamic. Java is loaded from compiled bytecode, while JavaScript is loaded as human-readable source code. Java's objects are class-based, while JavaScript's are prototype-based. Finally, Java did not support functional programming until Java 8, while JavaScript has done so from the beginning, being influenced by Scheme.\nJSON.\nJSON, or JavaScript Object Notation, is a general-purpose data interchange format that is defined as a subset of JavaScript's object literal syntax.\nWebAssembly.\nSince 2017, web browsers have supported WebAssembly, a binary format that enables a JavaScript engine to execute performance-critical portions of web page scripts close to native speed. WebAssembly code runs in the same sandbox as regular JavaScript code.\nasm.js is a subset of JavaScript that served as the forerunner of WebAssembly.\nTranspilers.\nJavaScript is the dominant client-side language of the Web, and many websites are script-heavy. Thus transpilers have been created to convert code written in other languages, which can aid the development process."}

{"id": "9855", "revid": "38777489", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9855", "title": "Exile", "text": "To be in exile means to be forced away from one's home (i.e. village, town, city, state, province, territory or even country) and unable to return. People (or corporations and even governments) may be in exile for various reasons, for legal (while being explicitly refused permission to return) or other reasons.\nIn Roman law, \"exsilium\" denoted both voluntary exile and banishment as a capital punishment alternative to death. Deportation was forced exile, and entailed the lifelong loss of citizenship and property. Relegation was a milder form of deportation, which preserved the subject's citizenship and property.\nThe term diaspora describes group exile, both voluntary and forced. \"Government in exile\" describes a government of a country that has relocated and argues its legitimacy from outside that country. Voluntary exile is often depicted as a form of protest by the person who claims it, to avoid persecution and prosecution (such as tax or criminal allegations), an act of shame or repentance, or isolating oneself to be able to devote time to a particular pursuit.\nArticle 9 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile.\"\nFor individuals.\nExiled heads of state.\nIn some cases the deposed head of state is allowed to go into exile following a coup or other change of government, allowing a more peaceful transition to take place or to escape justice.\nAvoiding tax or legal matters.\nA wealthy citizen who moves to a jurisdiction with lower taxes is termed a \"tax exile\". Creative people such as authors and musicians who achieve sudden wealth sometimes choose this solution. Examples include the British-Canadian writer Arthur Hailey, who moved to the Bahamas to avoid taxes following the runaway success of his novels \"Hotel\" and \"Airport\", and the English rock band the Rolling Stones who, in the spring of 1971, owed more in taxes than they could pay and left Britain before the government could seize their assets. Members of the band all moved to France for a period of time where they recorded music for the album that came to be called \"Exile on Main Street\", the Main Street of the title referring to the French Riviera. In 2012, Eduardo Saverin, one of the founders of Facebook, made headlines by renouncing his U.S. citizenship before his company's IPO. The dual Brazilian/U.S. citizen's decision to move to Singapore and renounce his citizenship spurred a bill in the U.S. Senate, the Ex-PATRIOT Act, which would have forced such wealthy \"tax exiles\" to pay a special tax in order to re-enter the United States.\nIn some cases a person voluntarily lives in exile to avoid legal issues, such as litigation or criminal prosecution. An example of this is Asil Nadir, who fled to the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus for 17 years rather than face prosecution in connection with the failed \u00a31.7 bn company Polly Peck in the United Kingdom.\nAvoiding violence or persecution, or in the aftermath of war.\nExamples include:\nEuphemism for convict.\nExile, government man and assigned servant were all euphemisms used in the 19th century for convicts under sentence who had been transported from Britain to Australia.\nFor groups, nations and governments.\nComfortable exile.\nComfortable exile is an alternative theory recently developed by anthropologist Binesh Balan in 2018. According to him, comfortable exile is a \"social exile of people who have been excluded from the mainstream society. Such people are considered 'aliens' or internal 'others' on the grounds of their religious, racial, ethnic, linguistic or caste-based identity and therefore they migrate to a comfortable space elsewhere after having risked their lives to restore representation, identity and civil rights in their own country and often capture a comfortable identity to being part of a dominant religion, society or culture.\"\nNation in exile.\nWhen a large group, or occasionally a whole people or nation is exiled, it can be said that this nation is in exile, or \"diaspora\". Nations that have been in exile for substantial periods include the Jews, who were deported by Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II in 586 BC and again following the destruction of the second Temple in Jerusalem in AD 70. Many Jewish prayers include a yearning to return to Jerusalem and the Jewish homeland.\nAfter the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century, and following the uprisings (like Ko\u015bciuszko Uprising, November Uprising and January Uprising) against the partitioning powers (Russia, Prussia and Austria), many Poles have chosen\u00a0\u2013 or been forced\u00a0\u2013 to go into exile, forming large diasporas (known as Polonia), especially in France and the United States. The entire population of Crimean Tatars (numbering 200,000 in all) that remained in their homeland of Crimea was exiled on 18 May 1944 to Central Asia as a form of ethnic cleansing and collective punishment on false accusations.\nSince the Cuban Revolution, over a million Cubans have left Cuba. Most of these self-identified as exiles as their motivation for leaving the island is political in nature. At the time of the Cuban Revolution, Cuba only had a population of 6.5\u00a0million, and was not a country that had a history of significant emigration, it being the sixth largest recipient of immigrants in the world as of 1958. Most of the exiles' children also consider themselves to be Cuban exiles. Under Cuban law, children of Cubans born abroad are considered Cuban citizens.\nGovernment in exile.\nDuring a foreign occupation or after a coup d'\u00e9tat, a \"government in exile\" of a such afflicted country may be established abroad. One of the most well-known instances of this is the Polish government-in-exile, a government in exile that commanded Polish armed forces operating outside Poland after German occupation during World War II. Other examples include the Free French Forces government of Charles de Gaulle of the same time, and the Central Tibetan Administration, commonly known as the Tibetan government-in-exile, and headed by the 14th Dalai Lama.\nIn popular culture.\nDrama.\nExile is an early motif in ancient Greek tragedy. In the ancient Greek world, this was seen as a fate worse than death. The motif reaches its peak on the play \"Medea\", written by Euripides in the fifth century BC, and rooted in the very old oral traditions of Greek mythology. Euripides\u2019 \"Medea\" has remained the most frequently performed Greek tragedy through the 20th century.\nArt.\nAfter Medea was abandoned by Jason and had become a murderess out of revenge, she fled to Athens and married king Aigeus there, and became the stepmother of the hero Theseus. Due to a conflict with him, she must leave the Polis and go away into exile. John William Waterhouse (1849\u20131917), the English Pre-Raphaelite painter\u2019s famous picture \"Jason and Medea\" shows a key moment before, when Medea tries to poison Theseus.\nLiterature.\nIn ancient Rome, the Roman Senate had the power to declare the exile to individuals, families or even entire regions. One of the Roman victims was the poet Ovid, who lived during the reign of Augustus. He was forced to leave Rome and move away to the city of Tomis on the Black Sea, now Constanta. There he wrote his famous work \"Tristia\" (Sorrows) about his bitter feelings in exile.\nAnother, at least in a temporary exile, was Dante.\nThe German-language writer Franz Kafka described the exile of Karl Rossmann in the posthumously published novel \"Amerika\".\nDuring the period of National Socialism in the first few years after 1933, many Jews, as well as a significant number of German artists and intellectuals fled into exile; for instance, the authors Klaus Mann and Anna Seghers. So Germany's own exile literature emerged and received worldwide credit. Klaus Mann finished his novel \"\" (\"The Volcano. A Novel Among Emigrants\") in 1939 describing the German exile scene, \"to bring the rich, scattered and murky experience of exile into epic form\", as he wrote in his literary balance sheet. At the same place and in the same year, Anna Seghers published her famous novel \"Das siebte Kreuz\" (\"The Seventh Cross\", published in the United States in 1942).\nImportant exile literatures in recent years include that of the Caribbean, many of whose artists emigrated to Europe or the United States for political or economic reasons. These writers include Nobel Prize winners V. S. Naipaul and Derek Walcott as well as the novelists Edwidge Danticat and Sam Selvon."}
{"id": "9857", "revid": "29738728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9857", "title": "Elbl\u0105g", "text": "Elbl\u0105g (; ; Old Prussian: ) is a city in northern Poland on the eastern edge of the \u017bu\u0142awy region with 119,317 inhabitants (December 2019). It is the capital of Elbl\u0105g County and has been assigned (since 1999) to the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship. Previously it was the capital of Elbl\u0105g Voivodeship (1975\u20131998) and a county seat within Gda\u0144sk Voivodeship (1945\u20131975).\nElbl\u0105g is one of the oldest cities in the province. Its history dates back to 1237, when the Teutonic Order constructed their fortified stronghold on the banks of a nearby river. The castle subsequently served as the official seat of the Teutonic Order Masters.\nElbl\u0105g became part of the Hanseatic League, which contributed much to the city's wealth. Through the Hansa agreement, the city was linked to other major ports like Gda\u0144sk, L\u00fcbeck and Amsterdam. Elbl\u0105g joined Poland in 1454 and after the defeat of the Teutonic Knights in the Thirteen Years\u2019 War was recognized as part of Poland in the Second Peace of Thorn in 1466. It then flourished and turned into a significant trading point, but its growth was eventually hindered by the Second Northern War and the Swedish Deluge.\nThe city was transferred to Prussia after the first partition of Poland in 1772. Its trading role greatly weakened, until the era of industrialization, which occurred in the 19th century. It was then that the famous Elbl\u0105g Canal was commissioned.\nAfter World War II the city again became part of Poland. The war casualties were catastrophic, especially the severe destruction of the Old Town district, one of the grandest in East Prussia. \nToday, Elbl\u0105g has over 120,000 inhabitants and is a \"vibrant city with an attractive tourist base\". It serves as an academic and financial center and among its numerous historic monuments is the Market Gate from 1309 and St. Nicholas Cathedral. Elbl\u0105g is also known for its archaeological sites, museums and the largest brewery in the country.\nThe Elbl\u0105g Canal, built in 1825\u201344 under Prussia, is a tourist site of Elbl\u0105g. The canal is believed to be one of the most important monuments related to the history of engineering and has been named one of the Seven Wonders of Poland. The canal was also named one of Poland's official national Historic Monuments (\"Pomnik historii\") in 2011. Its listing is maintained by the National Heritage Board of Poland.\nEtymology.\n\"Elbl\u0105g\" derives from the earlier German-language \"Elbing\", which is the name by which the Teutonic Knights knew both the river here and the citadel they established on its banks in 1237. The purpose of the citadel was to prevent the Old Prussian settlement of Truso from being reoccupied, the German crusaders being at war with the pagan Prussians. The citadel was named after the river, itself of uncertain etymology. One traditional etymology connects it to the name of the Helveconae, a Germanic tribe mentioned in Ancient Greek and Latin sources, but the etymology or language of the tribal name remains unknown. The oldest known mention of the river or town Elbing is in the form \"Ylfing\" in the report of a sailor Wulfstan from the end of the 9th century, in \"\" which was written in Anglo-Saxon in King Alfred's reign.\nModern city.\nElbing was almost completely destroyed at the end of World War II. The city became the Polish Elbl\u0105g after the war, when the area was ceded to Poland under border changes promulgated at the Potsdam Conference. Parts of the inner city were gradually rebuilt, and around 2000 rebuilding was begun in a style emulating the previous architecture, in many cases over the same foundations and utilizing old bricks and portions of the same walls. The western suburbs of the old city have not been reconstructed.\nThe modern city adjoins about half the length of the river between Lake Dru\u017cno and Elbl\u0105g Bay (\"Zatoka Elbl\u0105ska\", an arm of the Vistula Lagoon), and spreads out on both banks, though mainly on the eastern side. To the east is the Elbl\u0105g Upland (\"Wysoczyzna Elbl\u0105ska\"), a dome pushed up by glacial compression, 390\u00a0km2 in diameter and high at its greatest elevation. It gives the appearance of ridges and parkland.\nViews to the west show flat fields extending to the horizon; this part of the Vistula Delta (\"\u017bu\u0142awy Wi\u015blane\") is used mainly for agricultural purposes. To the south are the marshes and swamps of Dru\u017cno. The Elbl\u0105g River has been left in a more natural state through the city, but elsewhere it is a controlled channel with branches. One of them, the Jagiellonski Channel (\"Kana\u0142 Jagiello\u0144ski\"), leads to the Nogat River, along which navigation to Gda\u0144sk is common. The Elbl\u0105g Canal (\"Kana\u0142 Elbl\u0105ski\") connecting Lake Dru\u017cno with Drw\u0119ca River and Lake Jeziorak is a tourist site.\nElbl\u0105g is not a deep-water port. The draft of vessels using its waterways must be no greater than by law. The turning area at Elbl\u0105g is diameter and a pilot is required for large vessels. Deep water vessels cannot manoeuvre; in that sense, Elbl\u0105g has become a subsidiary port of Gda\u0144sk. Traffic of smaller vessels at Elbl\u0105g is within the river and very marginal, while larger vessels cannot reach the open Baltic Sea because the channel, once built in East-Prussia to go through the peninsula, has belonged to Russia since 1945. The city features three quay complexes, movable cranes, and railways.\nGeographical location.\nElbl\u0105g is located about south-east of Gda\u0144sk and south-west of Kaliningrad, Russia.\nThe city is a port on the river Elbl\u0105g, which flows into the Vistula Lagoon about to the north, thus giving the city access to the Baltic Sea via the Russian-controlled Strait of Baltiysk. The Old Town () is located on the river Elbl\u0105g connecting Lake Dru\u017cno to the Vistula Lagoon, about from the lagoon and from Gda\u0144sk.\nHistory.\nTruso.\nThe settlement was first mentioned as \"Ilfing\" in \"\", an Anglo-Saxon chronicle written in King Alfred's reign using information from a Viking who had visited the area.\nDuring the Middle Ages, the Viking settlement of Truso was located on Lake Dru\u017cno, near the current site of Elbl\u0105g in historical Pogesania; the settlement burned down in the 10th century. Early in the 13th century the Teutonic Knights conquered the region, built a castle, and founded Elbing on the lake, with a population mostly from L\u00fcbeck (today the lake, now much smaller, no longer reaches the city). After the uprising against the Teutonic Knights and the destruction of the castle by the inhabitants, the city successively came under the sovereignty of the Polish crown (1454), the Kingdom of Prussia (1772), and Germany (1871). Elbing was heavily damaged in World War II, and its German citizens were expelled upon the war's end. The city became part of Poland in 1945 and was repopulated with Polish citizens.\nThe seaport of Truso was first mentioned ca. 890 by Wulfstan of Hedeby, an Anglo-Saxon sailor, travelling on the south coast of the Baltic Sea at the behest of King Alfred the Great of England. The exact location of Truso was not known for a long time, as the seashore has significantly changed, but most historians trace the settlement inside or near to modern Elbl\u0105g on Lake Dru\u017cno. Truso was located at territory already known to the Roman Empire and earlier.\nIt was an important seaport serving the Vistula River bay on the early medieval Baltic Sea trade routes which led from Birka in the north to the island of Gotland and to Visby in the Baltic Sea. From there, traders continued further south to Carnuntum along the Amber Road. The ancient Amber Road led further southwest and southeast to the Black Sea and eventually to Asia. The east-west trade route went from Truso, along the Baltic Sea to Jutland, and from there inland by river to Hedeby, a large trading center in Jutland. The main goods of Truso were amber, furs, and slaves.\nArchaeological finds in 1897 and diggings in the 1920s placed Truso at Gut Hansdorf. A large burial field was also found at Elbing. Recent Polish diggings have found burned beams and ashes and thousand-year-old artifacts in an area of about 20 hectares. Many of these artifacts are now displayed at the Muzeum w Elbl\u0105gu.\nPrussian Crusade.\nAttempts to conquer Prussian land began in 997, when Boles\u0142aw I the Brave, at the urging of the Pope, sent a contingent of soldiers and a missionary (Adalbert of Prague) to the pagan Prussians, a non-Slavic people, on a crusade of conquest and conversion. The crusade encompassed much of the Baltic Sea coast, including Danzig (present day Gda\u0144sk), and other areas of the coast up to Sambia. Starting in 1209 additional crusades were called for by Konrad of Masovia, who mainly sought to conquer Prussian territory, rather than actually convert the indigenous Prussians. Despite heroic efforts, Old Prussian sovereignty would eventually collapse after a succession of wars instigated by Pope Honorius III and his frequent calls for crusade.\nBefore the Prussians and their neighbors to the west, the Pomeranians, were finally brought to heel, Polish rulers and the Duchy of Masovia, both by then Christianised peoples, would be continually frustrated in their attempts at northern expansion. Aside from minor border raids, major campaigns against the Prussians would be launched in 1219, 1220, and 1222. After a particularly sound defeat by Prussian forces in 1223, Polish forces in Che\u0142mno, the seat of Christian of Oliva and the Duchy of Masovia, were forced onto the defensive.\nIn 1226 Duke Konrad I of Masovia summoned the Teutonic Knights for assistance; by 1230 they had secured Che\u0142mno (Culm) and begun claiming conquered territories for themselves under the authority of the Holy Roman Empire, although these claims were rejected by the Poles, whose ambition had been to conquer Prussia all along. The Teutonic Order's strategy was to move down the Vistula and secure the delta, establishing a barrier between the Prussians and Danzig. The victorious Teutonic Knights built a castle at Elbing.\nThe Chronicon terrae Prussiae describes the conflict in the vicinity of Lake Drusen (now Dru\u017cno) shortly before the founding of Elbing:\nTruso did not disappear suddenly to be replaced with the citadel and town of Elbing during the Prussian Crusade. It had already burned down in the tenth century, with the population dispersed in the area.\nTeutonic Order.\nThe Chronicon terrae Prussiae describes the founding of Elbing under the leadership of Hermann Balk. After building two ships, the Pilgerim (Pilgrim) and the Vridelant (Friedland), with the assistance of Margrave Henry III of Margraviate of Meissen, the Teutonic Knights used them to clear the Vistula Lagoon (\"Frisches Haff\") and the Vistula Spit of Prussians:\nApparently the river was in Pomesania, which the knights had just finished clearing, but the bay was in Pogesania. The first Elbing was placed in Pogesania:\nBoth landings were amphibious operations conducted from the ships. The \"Chronicon\" relates that they were in use for many years and then were sunk in Lake Drusen. In 1238 the Dominican Order was invited to build a monastery on a grant of land. Pomesania was not secured, however, and from 1240-1242 the order began building a brick castle on the south side of the settlement. It may be significant that Elbing's first industry was the same as Truso's had been: manufacture of amber and bone artifacts for export. In 1243 William of Modena created the Diocese of Pomesania and three others. They were at first only ideological constructs, but the tides of time turned them into reality in that same century.\nThe foundation of Elbing was perhaps not the end of the Old Prussian story in the region. In 1825 a manuscript listing a vocabulary of the Baltic Old Prussian language, named the Elbing-Prussian Dictionary (), or more commonly in English just Elbing Vocabulary, was found among some manuscripts from a merchant's house. It contained 802 words in a dialect now termed Pomesanian with their equivalents in an early form of German.\nThe origin of the vocabulary remains unknown. Its format is like that of modern travel dictionaries; i.e., it may have been used by German speakers to communicate with Old Prussians, but the specific circumstances are only speculative. The manuscript became the Codex Neumannianus. It disappeared after a British bombing raid destroyed the library at Elbing but before then facsimiles had been made. The date of the MSS was estimated at ca. 1400, but it was a copy. There is no evidence concerning the provenance of the original, except that it must have been in Pomesanian.\nIn 1246 the town was granted a constitution under L\u00fcbeck law, used in maritime circumstances, instead of Magdeburg rights common in other cities in Central Europe. This decision of the Order was in keeping with its general strategy of espousing the trade association that in 1358 would become the Hanseatic League. The Order seized on this association early and used it to establish bases throughout the Baltic. The Order's involvement in the League was somewhat contradictory. In whatever cities they founded the ultimate authority was the commander of the town, who kept office in the citadel, typically used as a prison. L\u00fcbeck law, on the other hand, provided for self-government of the town.\nMembership in the Hanseatic League meant having important trading contacts with England, Flanders, France, and the Netherlands. The city received numerous merchant privileges from the rulers of England, Poland, Pomerania, and the Teutonic Order. For instance, the privilege of the Old Town was upgraded in 1343, while in 1393 it was granted an emporium privilege for grains, metals, and forest products.\nExcept for the citadel and churches, Elbing at the time was more of a small village by modern standards. Its area was . It featured a wharf, a marketplace and five streets, as well as a number of churches. The castle was completed in 1251. In 1288 fire destroyed the entire settlement except for the churches, which were of brick. A new circuit wall was started immediately. From 1315 to 1340 Elbl\u0105g was rebuilt. A separate settlement called New Town was founded ca. 1337 and received L\u00fcbeck rights in 1347. In 1349 the Black Death struck the town, toward the end of the European plague. After the population recovered it continued building up the city and in 1364 a crane was built for the port.\nThe German-language \"Elbinger Rechtsbuch\", written in Elbing, Prussia documented among other laws for the first time Polish common law. The German-language Polish laws are based on the Sachsenspiegel and were written down to aid the judges. It is thus the oldest source for documented Polish common law and is in Polish referred to as the \"Ksi\u0119ga Elbl\u0105ska\" (Book of Elbl\u0105g). It was written down in the second half of the 13th century.\nRevolt of 1410.\nIn 1410 the inhabitants of the city rebelled against Teutonic Knights while paying to Polish King Jagiello, who at the time was engaged in Polish\u2013Lithuanian\u2013Teutonic War. As the castle in Elblag was lightly defended by Polish garrison, the Teutonic Knights managed to retake it, promising the Polish defenders that they will be given free passage back to Poland. After the castle was taken, the Knights broke their promise and subsequently murdered a number of the captured defenders while imprisoning the rest.\nKingdom of Poland.\nIn 1440 several western and eastern Prussian towns formed the Prussian Confederation, which led the revolt of Prussia against the rule of the Teutonic Knights in 1454. For assistance against the Order, the Confederation asked for help from King Casimir IV of Poland. The burghers of Elbl\u0105g recognized Casimir as rightful ruler. After paying homage to the King, the city was granted great privileges, similar to those of Toru\u0144 and Gda\u0144sk. Casimir's incorporation of Prussia led to the Thirteen Years' War.\nAfter the Polish victory over the Teutonic Order, the city became part of the Malbork Voivodeship in the newly established autonomous province of Royal Prussia under the suzerainty of the Polish crown in the Second Peace of Thorn. The city was known to the Polish crown by its Polish name Elbl\u0105g. With the creation of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1569, the city was brought under direct control of the Polish crown. As one of the largest and most influential cities of Poland, it enjoyed voting rights during the royal election period in Poland.\nWith the 16th century Protestant Reformation the burghers became Lutherans and the first Lutheran Gymnasium was established in Elbl\u0105g in 1535.\nFrom 1579 Elbl\u0105g had close trade relations with England, to which the city accorded free trade. English, Scottish, and Irish merchants settled in the city. They formed the Scottish Reformed Church of Elbl\u0105g and became Elbl\u0105g citizens, aiding Lutheran Sweden in the Thirty Years' War. The rivalry of nearby Danzig interrupted trading links several times. By 1618 Elbl\u0105g had left the Hanseatic League owing to its close business dealings with England.\nFamous inhabitants of the city at that time included native sons Hans von Bodeck and Samuel Hartlib. During the Thirty Years' War, Swedish Chancellor Axel Oxenstierna brought the Moravian Brethren refugee John Amos Comenius to Elbl\u0105g for six years (1642\u20131648). In 1642 Johann Stob\u00e4us, who composed with Johann Eccard, published the \" Preussische Fest-Lieder\", a number of evangelical Prussian songs. In 1646 the city recorder Daniel Barholz noted that the city council employed \"Bernsteindreher\", or \"Paternostermacher\", licensed and guilded amber craftsmen who worked on prayer beads, rosaries, and many other items made of amber. Members of the Barholz family became mayors and councillors.\nDuring the Thirty Years' War, the Vistula Lagoon was the main southern Baltic base of King Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, who was hailed as the protector of the Protestants. By 1660 the Vistula Lagoon had gone to Elector Frederick William of Brandenburg-Prussia, but was returned in 1700.\nThe poet Christian Wernicke was born in 1661 in Elbl\u0105g, while Gottfried Achenwall became famous for his teachings in natural law and human rights law. In 1700\u20131710 it was occupied by Swedish troops. In 1709 it was besieged, taken by storm on February 2, 1710 by Russian troops with support of Prussian artillery. The city was handed over to Polish King Augustus II in 1712.\nThe Imperial cartographer Johann Friedrich Endersch completed a map of Warmia in 1755 and also made a copper etching of the galley named \"The City of Elbing\" .\nDuring the War of the Polish Succession in 1734, Elbl\u0105g wasplaced under military occupation by Russia and Saxony. The town came again under occupation by Russia from 1758-1762 during the Seven Years' War.\nKingdom of Prussia.\nDuring the First Partition of Poland in 1772 Elbl\u0105g was annexed by King Frederick the Great of the Kingdom of Prussia. Elbing became part of the new Prussian Province of West Prussia in 1773. In the 1815 provincial reorganization following the Napoleonic Wars, Elbing and its hinterland were included within Regierungsbezirk Danzig in West Prussia.\nElbing industrialized under the sovereignty of the Hohenzollern kings in Berlin. In 1828 the first steamship was built by Ignatz Grunau. In 1837 Ferdinand Schichau started the Schichau-Werke company in Elbing as well as another shipyard in Danzig later on. Schichau constructed the \"Borussia\", the first screw-vessel in Germany. Schichau-Werke built hydraulic machinery, ships, steam engines, and torpedoes. After the inauguration of the railway to K\u00f6nigsberg in 1853, Elbing's industry began to grow. Schichau worked together with his son-in-law Carl H. Zise, who continued the industrial complex after Schichau's death. Schichau erected large complexes for his many thousands of workers.\nGeorg Steenke, an engineer from K\u00f6nigsberg, connected Elbing near the Baltic Sea with the southern part of Prussia by building the Oberl\u00e4ndischer Kanal (Elbl\u0105g Canal).\nElbing became part of the Prussian-led German Empire in 1871 during the unification of Germany. As Elbing became an industrial city, the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) frequently received the majority of votes; in the 1912 Reichstag elections the SPD received 51% of the vote. After World War I, most of West Prussia became part of the Second Polish Republic. Elbing was joined to German East Prussia, and was separated from Weimar Germany by the so-called Polish Corridor.\nThird Reich.\nDuring the Nazi Germany era (1933\u20131945), three subcamps of the Stutthof concentration camp were located near the town: \"Elbing\", \"Elbing (Org. Todt)\", and \"Elbing (Schinau)\". These were closed and many of the German inhabitants of Elbing forced to flee as the Soviet Red Army approached the city toward the end of World War II (see Evacuation of East Prussia). Laid under siege since January 23, 1945, about 65% of the city infrastructure was destroyed, including most of the historical city center. The town was captured by the Soviet Red Army during the night of February 9/10, 1945. During the first days of the siege most of the population of approximately 100,000 persons fled. After the end of war, in spring 1945, the region together with the town of Elbing became part of Poland as a result of the Potsdam Conference and the area was settled by Poles after remaining Germans were either transferred or fled to Germany. As of 1 November 1945 16.838 Germans remained in the town.\nHistory after 1945.\nThe city was repopulated and given the Polish name \"Elbl\u0105g\". Elbl\u0105g' was part of the so-called Recovered Territories and out of the new inhabitants, 98% were Poles expelled from Polish areas annexed by the Soviet Union from central Poland. Parts of the damaged historical city center were completely demolished, with the bricks being used to rebuild Warsaw and Gda\u0144sk. The Communist authorities had originally planned that the Old Town, utterly destroyed during the fighting since January 23, 1945, would be built over with blocks of flats; however, economic difficulties thwarted this effort. Two churches were reconstructed and the remaining ruins of the old town were torn down in the 1960s.\nAlong with Tricity and Szczecin, Elbl\u0105g was the scene of rioting in the coastal cities in 1970 (see also Polish 1970 protests). Since 1990 the German minority population has had a modest resurgence, with the Elbinger Deutsche Minderheit Organization counting around 450 members in 2000.\nRestoration of the Old Town began after 1989. Since the beginning of the restoration, an extensive archaeological programme has been carried out. Most of the city's heritage was destroyed during the construction of basements in the 19th century or during World War II, but the backyards and latrines of the houses remained largely unchanged, and have provided information on the city's history. In some instances, private investors have incorporated parts of preserved stonework into new architecture. By 2006, approximately 75% of the Old Town had been reconstructed. The city museum presents many pieces of art and items of everyday use, including the only 15th century binoculars preserved in Europe.\nElbl\u0105g is also home to the Elbrewery, Poland's largest brewery, which belongs to the \u017bywiec Group (Heineken). The history of the Elblag Brewing Tradition dates back to 1309, when Teutonic Master Siegfried von Leuchtwangen granted brewing privileges to the town of Elbing. The present brewery was founded in 1872 as the Elbinger Aktien-Brauerei. In the early 1900s, the brewery was the exclusive supplier of Pilsner beer to the court of German Emperor Wilhelm II.\nHistoric buildings.\nUntil World War II there were many Gothic, renaissance and baroque houses in Elbl\u0105g's Old Town; some of them are reconstructed. Other preserved buildings are:\nPolitics.\nElbl\u0105g constituency.\nMembers of Parliament (Sejm) elected from Elbl\u0105g constituency\nInternational relations.\nTwin towns \u2014 sister cities.\nElbl\u0105g is twinned with:"}

Member parties advocate either for full political independence and sovereignty, or some form of devolution or self-governance for their country or region. The alliance has generally limited its membership to progressive parties; therefore, only a fraction of European regionalist parties are members of the EFA.\nSince 1999, the EFA and the European Green Party (EGP) have joined forces within Greens\u2013European Free Alliance (Greens/EFA) group in the European Parliament, although some EFA members have joined other groups from time to time.\nThe EFA's youth wing is the European Free Alliance Youth (EFAY), founded in 2000.\nAs of 2020 three European regions are led by EFA politicians: Scotland with Nicola Sturgeon of the Scottish National Party, Flanders with Jan Jambon of the New Flemish Alliance, and Corsica with Gilles Simeoni of For Corsica.\nHistory.\nRegionalists have long been represented in the European Parliament. In the 1979 election four regionalist parties obtained seats: the Scottish National Party (SNP), the Flemish People's Union (VU), the Brussels-based Democratic Front of Francophones (FDF) and the South Tyrolean People's Party (SVP). The SNP, although being predominantly social-democratic, joined the European Progressive Democrats, a conservative group led by the French Rally for the Republic. The VU and the FDF joined the heterogeneous Technical Group of Independents, while the SVP joined the European People's Party group.\nIn 1981 six parties (VU, the Frisian National Party, Independent Fianna F\u00e1il, the Party of German-speaking Belgians, the Party for the Organization of a Free Brittany and the Alsace-Lorraine National Association), plus three observers (the Union of the Corsican People, UPC, the Occitan Party and the Democratic Convergence of Catalonia, CDC), joined forces to form the European Free Alliance. Regionalist MEPs continued, however, to sit in different groups also after the 1984 election: the SNP in the Gaullist-dominated European Democratic Alliance; the VU, the Sardinian Action Party (PSd'Az) and Basque Solidarity (EA) in the Rainbow Group, together with Green parties; the SVP in the European People's Party group; the CDC with the Liberal Democrats; and Batasuna among Non-Inscrits.\nOnly after the 1989 European Parliament election did EFA members form a united group, called Rainbow like its green predecessor. It consisted of three Italian MEPs (two for Lega Lombarda and one for the PSd'Az), two Spanish MEPs (one each for the PNV and the Andalusian Party, PA), one Belgian MEP (for VU), one French MEP (UPC), one British MEP (SNP) and one independent MEP from Ireland. They were joined by 4 MEPs from the Danish left-wing Eurosceptic People's Movement against the EU, while the other regionalist parties, including the SVP, Batasuna and the Convergence and Union of Catalonia (CiU) declined to join.\nIn the 1994 European Parliament election the regionalists lost many seats. Moreover, the EFA had suspended its major affiliate, Lega Nord, for having joined forces in government with the post-fascist National Alliance. Also, the PNV chose to switch to the European People's Party (EPP). The three remaining EFA MEPs (representing the SNP, the VU and the Canarian Coalition) formed a group with the French \"\u00c9nergie Radicale\" list and the Italian Pannella List: the European Radical Alliance.\nFollowing the 1999 European Parliament election, in which EFA parties did quite well, EFA elected MEPs formed a joint group with the European Green Party, under the name Greens\u2013European Free Alliance (Greens/EFA). In the event the EFA supplied ten members: two each from the Scottish SNP, the Welsh Plaid Cymru, and the Flemish VU, and one each from the Basque PNV and EA, the Andalusian PA and the Galician Nationalist Bloc (BNG).\nIn the 2004 European Parliament election, the EFA, which had formally become a European political party, was reduced to four MEPs: two from the SNP (Ian Hudghton and Alyn Smith), one from Plaid Cymru (Jill Evans) and one from the Republican Left of Catalonia (ERC; Bernat Joan i Mar\u00ed, replaced at the mid-term by MEP Mikel Irujo of the Basque EA). They were joined by two associate members: Tatjana \u017ddanoka of For Human Rights in United Latvia (PCTVL) and L\u00e1szl\u00f3 T\u0151k\u00e9s, an independent MEP and former member of the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UMDR). Co-operation between the EFA and the Greens continued.\nFollowing the 2008 revision of the EU Regulation that governs European political parties allowing the creation of European foundations affiliated to European political parties, the EFA established its official foundation/think tank, the Coppieters Foundation (CF), in September 2007.\nIn the 2009 European Parliament election, six MEPs were returned for the EFA: two from the SNP (Ian Hudghton and Alyn Smith), one from Plaid Cymru (Jill Evans), one from the Party of the Corsican Nation (PNC; Fran\u00e7ois Alfonsi), one from the ERC (Oriol Junqueras), and Tatjana \u017ddanoka, an individual member of the EFA from Latvia. After the election, the New Flemish Alliance (N-VA) also joined the EFA. The EFA subgroup thus counted seven MEPs.\nIn the 2014 European Parliament election, EFA-affiliated parties returned twelve seats to the Parliament: four for the N-VA, two for the SNP, two for \"The Left for the Right to Decide\" (an electoral list primarily composed of the ERC), one for \"The Peoples Decide\" (an electoral list maily comprising EH Bildu, a Basque coalition including EA), one for \"European Spring\" (an electoral list comprising the Valencian Nationalist Bloc, BNV, and the Aragonese Union, ChA), one from Plaid Cymru, and one from the Latvian Russian Union (LKS). Due to ideological divergences with the Flemish Greens, the N-VA defected to the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group and the EH Bildu MEP joined the European United Left\u2013Nordic Green Left (GUE/NGL) group. Thus, EFA had seven members in the Greens/EFA group and four within ECR.\nIn the 2019 European Parliament election the EFA gained a fourth seat in the United Kingdom, due to the SNP gaining a third seat to add to Plaid's one. However, the EFA suffered the loss of these seats later in 2019 due to Brexit, which meant SNP and PC MEPs had to leave.\nIdeology.\nIn the Brussels declaration of 2000 the EFA codified its political principles. The EFA stands for \"a Europe of Free Peoples based on the principle of subsidiarity, which believe in solidarity with each other and the peoples of the world.\" The EFA sees itself as an alliance of stateless peoples, striving towards recognition, autonomy, independence or wanting a proper voice in Europe. It supports European integration on basis of the subsidiarity-principle. It believes also that Europe should move away from further centralisation and works towards the formation of a \"Europe of regions\". It believes that regions should have more power in Europe, for instance participating in the Council of the European Union, when matters within their competence are discussed. It also wants to protect the linguistic and cultural diversity within the EU.\nThe EFA broadly stands on the left-wing of the political spectrum. The Brussels declaration emphasises the protection of human rights, sustainable development and social justice. In 2007 the EFA congress in Bilbao added several progressive principles to the declaration, including a commitment to fight against racism, antisemitism, discrimination, xenophobia and Islamophobia, and a commitment to get full citizenship for immigrants, including voting rights.\nEFA members are generally progressive, although there are some notable exceptions as the conservative New Flemish Alliance, Bavaria Party, Schleswig Party and Future of \u00c5land, the Christian-democratic Slovene Union, the centre-right Liga Veneta Repubblica and the far-right South Tyrolean Freedom.\nOrganisation.\nThe main organs of the EFA organisation are the General Assembly, the Bureau and the Secretariat.\nGeneral Assembly.\nIn the General Assembly, the supreme council of the EFA, every member party has one vote.\nBureau and Secretariat.\nThe Bureau takes care of daily affairs. It is chaired by Lorena Lopez de Lacalle (Basque Solidarity), president of the EFA, while Jordi Sol\u00e9 (Republican Left of Catalonia) is secretary-general and Anke Spoorendonk (South Schleswig Voters' Association) treasurer.\nThe Bureau is completed by ten vice-presidents: Marta Bainka (Silesian Autonomy Movement), Olrik Bouma (Frisian National Party), (Future of \u00c5land), Jill Evans (Plaid Cymru), Fernando Fuente Cortina (Valencian Nationalist Bloc), Victor Gallou (Breton Democratic Union), David Grosclaude (Occitan Party), Wouter Patho (New Flemish Alliance), Nelida Pogagcic (Lista za Rijeku - Lista per Fiume) and Anne Tomasi (Party of the Corsican Nation).\nMember parties.\nBefore becoming a member party, an organisation needs to have been an observer of the EFA for at least one year. Only one member party per region is allowed. If a second party from a region wants to join the EFA, the first party needs to agree, at which point these two parties will then form a common delegation with one vote. The EFA also recognises friends of the EFA, a special status for regionalist parties outside of the European Union.\nThe following is the list of EFA members and former members."}

The ALDE Party is affiliated with the Liberal International and a recognised European political party, incorporated as a non-profit association under Belgian law.\nIt was founded on 26 March 1976 in Stuttgart as a confederation of national political parties under the name \"Federation of Liberal and Democrat Parties in Europe\" and renamed \"European Liberals and Democrats\" (ELD) in 1977 and \"European Liberal Democrats and Reformists\" (ELDR) in 1986. On 30 April 2004, the ELDR was reformed as an official European party, the \"European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party\" (ELDR Party).\nOn 10 November 2012, the party chose its current name of ALDE Party, taken from its then-European Parliament group, the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE), which had been formed on 20 July 2004 in conjunction with the European Democratic Party (EDP). Prior to the 2004 European election the European party had been represented through its own group, the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party Group (ELDR) Group. In June 2019, the ALDE group was succeeded by Renew Europe.\n, ALDE is represented in European Union institutions, with 65 MEPs and five members of the European Commission.

On 26 March 1976, the Federation of Liberal and Democrat Parties in Europe was established in Stuttgart. The founding parties of the federation were the Free Democratic Party of Germany, Radical Party of France, Venstre of Denmark, Italian Liberal Party, Dutch People's Party for Freedom and Democracy and Democratic Party of Luxembourg. Observer members joining later in 1976 were the Danish Social Liberal Party, French Radical Party of the Left and Independent Republicans, British Liberal Party, and Italian Republican Party. In 1977, the federation was renamed European Liberals and Democrats, in 1986, European Liberal Democrats and Reformists.\nIt evolved into the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party (ELDR Party) in 2004, when it was founded as an official European party under that name and incorporated under Belgian law at an extraordinary Congress in Brussels, held on 30 April 2004 the day before the enlargement of the European Union. At the same time the matching group in the European Parliament, the European Liberal Democrats and Reformists Group allied with the members of the newly elected European Democratic Party, forming the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) with a matching ALDE Group in the European Parliament.\nOn 10 November 2012, the ELDR Party adopted the name of the alliance between the two parties, to match the parliamentary group and the alliance.\nOn 12 June 2019, the ALDE group was succeeded by a new enlarged group, Renew Europe, which primarily consists of ALDE and EDP member parties and France's La R\u00e9publique En Marche!

It sometimes includes independent MEPs and/or deputies from unaffiliated national parties. The EPP Group comprises politicians of Christian-democratic, conservative and liberal-conservative orientation.\nThe European People's Party was officially founded as a European political party in 1976. However, the European People's Party Group in the European Parliament has existed in one form or another since June 1953, from the Common Assembly of the European Coal and Steel Community, making it one of the oldest European-level political groups. It has been the largest political group in the European Parliament since 1999.\nHistory.\nThe Common Assembly of the European Coal and Steel Community (the predecessor of the present day European Parliament) first met on 10 September 1952 and the first Christian Democratic Group was unofficially formed the next day, with Maan Sassen as president. The group held 38 of the 78 seats, two short of an absolute majority. On 16 June 1953 the Common Assembly passed a resolution enabling the official formation of political groups, and on 23 June 1953 the constituent declaration of the group was published and the group was officially formed.\nThe Christian Democrat group was the biggest group at formation, but as time wore on it lost support and was the second-biggest group by the time of the 1979 elections. As the European Community expanded into the European Union, the dominant centre-right parties in the new member states were not necessarily Christian democratic, and the EPP (European People's Party, the pan-continental political party founded in 1976 which all group members are now affiliated to) feared being sidelined. To counter this, the EPP expanded its remit to cover the centre-right regardless of tradition and pursued a policy of integrating liberal-conservative parties.\nThis policy led to Greek New Democracy and Spanish People's Party MEPs joining the EPP Group. The British Conservative Party and Danish Conservative People's Party tried to maintain a group of their own called the \"European Democrats\" (ED), but lack of support and the problems inherent in maintaining a small group forced ED's collapse in the 1990s, and its members crossed the floor to join the EPP Group. The parties of these MEPs also became full members of the EPP (with the exception of the British Conservatives who did not join the Party) and this consolidation process of the European centre-right throughout the 1990s with the acquisition of members from the Italian party Forza Italia. However, the consolidation was not unalloyed and a split emerged with the Eurosceptic MEPs who congregated in a subgroup within the group, also called the \"European Democrats\" (ED).\nNevertheless, the consolidation held through the 1990s, assisted by the group being renamed to the \"European People's Party \u2013 European Democrats\" (EPP-ED) group, and after the 1999 European elections the EPP-ED reclaimed its position as the largest group in the Parliament from the Party of European Socialists (PES) group.\nSize was not enough, however: the group did not have a majority. It continued therefore to engage in the \"Grand Coalition\" (a coalition with the PES Group, or occasionally the Liberals) to generate the majorities required by the cooperation procedure under the Single European Act. This coalition has held, although occasionally the group adopts a government-opposition dynamic with the other groups, notably during the budget crisis when it opposed the PES and brought about the resignation of the Santer Commission.\nMeanwhile, the parties in the European Democrats subgroup were growing restless and finally left following the 2009 elections, when the Czech Civic Democratic Party and British Conservative party formed their own right-wing European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group on 22 June 2009, abolishing the European Democrats subgroup from that date. The EPP-ED Group reverted to its original name \u2013 the EPP Group \u2013 immediately.\nIn the 7th European Parliament the EPP Group remains the largest parliamentary group with 275 MEPs. It is currently the only political group in the European parliament to fully represent its corresponding European political party, i.e. the European People's Party. The United Kingdom was the only member to not be represented in the group until 28 February 2018, when two MEPs suspended from the Conservative Party left the European Conservatives and Reformists and joined the EPP. The two MEPs later joined a breakaway political party in the UK, The Independent Group.\nAfter twelve member parties in the EPP called for Hungary's Fidesz's expulsion or suspension, Fidesz's membership was suspended with a common agreement on 20 March 2019. The suspension was applied only to the EPP but not to its group in the Parliament. On 3 March 2021, Fidesz decided to leave the EPP group, after the group's new rules, however still kept their membership in the party. On 18 March 2021, Fidesz decided to leave the European People's Party.\nMembership at formation.\nThe 38 members in the group on 11 September 1952 were as follows:\nStructure.\nOrganisation.\nThe EPP Group is governed by a collective (referred to as the \"Presidency\") that allocates tasks. The Presidency consists of the Group Chair and a maximum of ten Vice-Chairs, including the Treasurer. The day-to-day running of the EPP Group is performed by its secretariat in the European Parliament, led by its Secretary-General. The Group runs its own think-tank, the European Ideas Network, which brings together opinion-formers from across Europe to discuss issues facing the European Union from a centre-right perspective.\nThe EPP Group Presidency includes:\nThe chairs of the group and its predecessors from 1952 to 2020 are as follows:\nMembership.\n9th European Parliament.\nThe EPP Group has MEPs from each of the 27 member states. The national parties that have Members of the EPP Group are as follows:\nActivities.\nIn the news.\nActivities performed by the group in the period between June 2004 and June 2008 include monitoring elections in Palestine and the Ukraine; encouraging transeuropean rail travel, telecoms deregulation, energy security, a common energy policy, the accession of Bulgaria and Romania to the Union, partial reform of the CAP and attempts to tackle illegal immigration; denouncing Russian involvement in South Ossetia; supporting the Constitution Treaty and the Lisbon Treaty; debating globalisation, relations with China, and Taiwan; backing plans to outlaw Holocaust denial; nominating Anna Politkovskaya for the 2007 Sakharov Prize; expelling Daniel Hannan from the Group; the discussion about whether ED MEPs should remain within EPP-ED or form a group of their own; criticisms of the group's approach to tackling low turnout for the 2009 elections; the group's use of the two-President arrangement; and the group's proposal to ban the Islamic Burka dress EU wide.\nParliamentary activity profile.\nThe debates and votes in the European Parliament are tracked by its website and categorised by the groups that participate in them and the rule of procedure that they fall into. The results give a profile for each group by category and the total indicates the group's level of participation in Parliamentary debates. The activity profile for each group for the period 1 August 2004 to 1 August 2008 in the Sixth Parliament is given on the diagram on the right. The group is denoted in blue.\nThe website shows the group as participating in 659 motions, making it the third most active group during the period.\nPublications.\nThe group produces many publications, which can be found on its website. Documents produced in 2008 cover subjects such as dialogue with the Orthodox Church, study days, its strategy for 2008\u201309, Euro-Mediterranean relations, and the Treaty of Lisbon. It also publishes a yearbook and irregularly publishes a presentation, a two-page summary of the group.\nAcademic analysis.\nThe group has been characterised as a three-quarter male group that, prior to ED's departure, was only 80% cohesive and split between centre-right Europhiles (the larger EPP subgroup) and right-wing Eurosceptics (the smaller ED subgroup). The group as a whole is described as ambiguous on hypothetical EU taxes, against taxation, Green issues, social liberal issues (LGBT rights, abortion, euthanasia) and full Turkish accession to the European Union, and for a deeper Federal Europe, deregulation, the Common Foreign and Security Policy and controlling migration into the EU."}

Before January 2021, it was named the European United Left/Nordic Green Left (, GUE/NGL).\nThe group comprises political parties of socialist and communist orientation.\nHistory.\nIn 1995, the enlargement of the European Union led to the creation of the Nordic Green Left group of parties. The Nordic Green Left (NGL) merged with the Confederal Group of the European United Left (GUE) on 6 January 1995, forming the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left. The NGL suffix was added to the name of the expanded group on insistence of Swedish and Finnish MEPs. The group initially consisted of MEPs from the Finnish Left Alliance, the Swedish Left Party, the Danish Socialist People's Party, the United Left of Spain (including the Spanish Communist Party), the Synaspismos of Greece, the French Communist Party, the Portuguese Communist Party, the Communist Party of Greece and the Communist Refoundation Party of Italy.\nIn 1998, Ken Coates, an expelled MEP from the British Labour Party who co-founded the Independent Labour Network, joined the group.\nIn 1999, the German Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) and the Greek Democratic Social Movement (DIKKI) joined as full members while the five MEPs elected from the list of the French Trotskyist alliance LO\u2013LCR and the one MEP for the Dutch Socialist Party joined as associate members.\nIn 2002, four MEPs from the French Citizen and Republican Movement and one from the Danish People's Movement against the EU also joined the group.\nIn 2004, no MEPs were elected from LO\u2013LCR and DIKKI\u2014which was undergoing a dispute with its leader over the party constitution\u2014, as well as the French Citizen and Republican Movement, did not put forward candidates. MEPs from the Portuguese Left Bloc, the Irish Sinn F\u00e9in, the Progressive Party of Working People of Cyprus and the Communist Party of Bohemia and Moravia joined the group. The Danish Socialist People's Party, a member of the Nordic Green Left, left the group to instead sit in the Greens\u2013European Free Alliance group.\nIn 2009, no MEPs were elected from the Italian Communist Refoundation Party and the Finnish Left Alliance. MEPs from the Irish Socialist Party, the Socialist Party of Latvia and the French Left Party joined the group.\nIn 2013, one MEP from the Croatian Labourists \u2013 Labour Party also joined the group.\nIn 2014, no MEPs were elected from the Irish Socialist Party, the Socialist Party of Latvia and the Croatian Labourists \u2013 Labour Party. MEPs from the Spanish Podemos as well as EH Bildu and the Dutch Party for the Animals joined the group, while MEPs from the Italian Communist Refoundation Party and the Finnish Left Alliance reentered parliament and rejoined. The Communist Party of Greece, a founding member of the group, decided to leave and instead sit as Non-Inscrits.\nIn 2019, no MEPs were elected from the French Communist Party, the Danish People's Movement against the EU, the Dutch Socialist Party and from the Italian parties The Left and the Communist Refoundation Party. MEPs from the French La France insoumise, the Belgian Workers' Party of Belgium, the German Human Environment Animal Protection, the Irish Independents 4 Change and the Danish Red-Green Alliance joined the group.\nPosition.\nAccording to its 1994 constituent declaration, the group is opposed to the present European Union political structure, but it is committed to integration. That declaration sets out three aims for the construction of another European Union, namely the total change of institutions to make them fully democratic, breaking with neo-liberal monetarist policies, and a policy of co-development and equitable cooperation. The group wants to disband the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and strengthen the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE).\nThe group is ambiguous between reformism and revolution, leaving it up to each party to decide on the manner they deem best suited to achieve these aims. As such, it has simultaneously positioned itself as insiders within the European institutions, enabling it to influence the decisions made by co-decision; and as outsiders by its willingness to seek another Europe which would abolish the Maastricht Treaty.\nOrganisation.\nThe GUE/NGL is a confederal group who is composed of MEPs from national parties. Those national parties must share common political objectives with the group as specified in the group's constituent declaration. Nevertheless, those national parties and not the group retain control of their MEPs, therefore the group may be divided on certain issues.\nMembers of the group meet regularly to prepare for meetings, debate on policies and vote on resolutions. The group also publishes reports on various topics.\nMember parties.\nMEPs may be full or associate members.\nNational parties may be full or associate members.\nMembership.\n9th European Parliament.\nThe initial member parties for the 9th European Parliament was determined at the first meeting on 29 May 2019."}

It was a political group in the European Parliament from 1979 until 1992, when it became a subgroup of the European People's Party\u2013European Democrats (EPP-ED) group. The European Democrats continued to exist as a political group in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) until 2014, when it became the European Conservatives Group.\nEuropean Democrats in the European Parliament.\n1979\u20131992.\nThe European Democratic Group (ED) was formed on 17 July 1979 by British Conservative Party, Danish Conservative People's Party and other MEPs after their success in the 1979 elections. It supplanted the earlier European Conservative Group.\nIn the late seventies and early eighties, the ED was the third-largest political group in the European Parliament.\nHowever, the group saw its membership fall sharply in the late 1980s, as many centre-right members moved to the rival European People's Party (EPP), dominated by the Christian Democratic Union of Germany (CDU), Italian Christian Democrats and the ideology of Christian democracy in general. The ED had been somewhat further from the political centre and less pro-European than the EPP. Largely isolated, even hardline eurosceptics like Margaret Thatcher conceded that the British Conservatives could not be effectively heard from such a peripheral group.\n1992\u20131999.\nOn 1 May 1992, the ED (now largely composed of UK Conservative Party members) dissolved, and its remaining members were accorded \"associated party\" status in the European People's Party Group; that is, being part of the parliamentary group without retaining actual membership in the EPP Europarty organisation. This was considered essential for the Conservatives, as the EPP was generally seen as quite favourable to European integration, a stance at odds with their core ideology. The Conservatives' relationship to the EPP would become a sore point in the following years, particularly for the eurosceptic general membership in Britain. Then-leader of the British Conservative Party William Hague hoped to put the issue to rest by negotiating a new arrangement in 1999 by which the EPP's parliamentary group would rebrand itself as the European People's Party\u2013European Democrats (EPP-ED), with the \"European Democrat\" nomenclature returning after a seven-year hiatus. This was intended to nominally underscore the Conservatives' status apart from the rest of EPP, and it was hoped that with the coming enlargement of the European Union numerous newly involved right-wing parties, averse to the EPP proper for its perceived European federalism, would be willing to instead enter the ED subgroup, growing the overall alignment.\n1999\u20132009.\nThe arrangement proved to do little to appease opposition. Hague's successor, Iain Duncan Smith, made a concerted drive at one point to resurrect the European Democratic Group, but backed off when it became clear that Conservative MEPs would not move voluntarily. The hope that multiple Central and European parties would join ED also proved to be dubious, as only the Czech Civic Democratic Party took up the offer, with the remainder joining EPP proper or other groups such as Union for Europe of the Nations (UEN) or Independence and Democracy (IND/DEM). Meanwhile, the ED remained a more eurosceptic subgroup within the broader EPP-ED bloc that contributed slightly more than 10% of its total MEPs. It resisted the trend of incorporating as a European political party.\nDuring the 2005 Conservative leadership contest, eventual winner David Cameron pledged to withdraw the Conservatives from the EPP-ED group, while opponent David Davis argued in a letter to the editor of the Daily Telegraph that the current ED arrangement allowed the Conservatives to maintain suitable distance from EPP while still having influence in the largest parliamentary grouping. Conservative/EPP-ED MEP Martin Callanan responded in that paper the following day:\nThe Czech Civic Democratic Party (ODS), the Law and Justice (PiS) of Poland and the Rally For France party were among the first to discuss forming a breakaway group under the Movement for European Reform. Sir Reg Empey, Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) has committed his party thereunto Its position would be that the European Union should exist, but as a looser supranational organisation than at present, making the group less eurosceptic than the UEN and IND/DEM groups. Some members from the above parties founded a new organization, the Alliance for an Open Europe, in the midst of this debate, with broadly similar objectives.\nCameron initially intended to form the new group in 2006, though this aspiration had to be cancelled due to their main prospective partners, the ODS and PiS, being unable or unwilling to break away from their then-groupings; the new grouping was put on hiatus until the 2009 European elections. By then, new factors\u2014including the collapse of the UEN group\u2014made conditions for forming a new political grouping much more favourable. On 22 June 2009, the founder members of the European Conservatives and Reformists (ECR) group, all signatories of the Prague Declaration announced that they were to leave the EPP-ED, and in virtue of that fact, the European Democrats movement. This announcement ended the 30-year existence of the European Democrats in the European Parliament.\nFormer member parties.\nThe following political parties were associated with the European Democrats at some point:\nEuropean Democrats in PACE (Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe).\nThe European Democrat Group in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe was founded as the Group of Independent Representatives in 1970 by British and Scandinavian members of PACE, having about 35\u201340 members from the UK, Ireland, Norway, Denmark, Turkey, Sweden and Switzerland. It adopted the European Democrats Group name in September 1980, later becoming the European Conservatives Group in 2014."}
{"id": "9869", "revid": "18872885", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9869", "title": "Epistle to the Ephesians", "text": "The Epistle to the Ephesians, also called the Letter to the Ephesians and often shortened to Ephesians, is the tenth book of the New Testament. Its authorship has traditionally been attributed to Paul the Apostle but starting in 1792, this has been challenged as Deutero-Pauline, that is, written in Paul's name by a later author strongly influenced by Paul's thought, probably \"by a loyal disciple to sum up Paul\u2019s teaching and to apply it to a new situation fifteen to twenty-five years after the Apostle\u2019s death\".\nThemes.\nAccording to New Testament scholar Daniel Wallace, the theme may be stated pragmatically as \"Christians, get along with each other! Maintain the unity practically which Christ has effected positionally by his death.\"\nAnother major theme in Ephesians is the keeping of Christ's body (that is, the Church) pure and holy. \nIn the second part of the letter, Ephesians 4:17\u20136:20, the author gives practical advice in how to live a holy, pure, and Christ-inspired lifestyle.\nComposition.\nAccording to tradition, the Apostle Paul wrote the letter while he was in prison in Rome (around AD 62). This would be about the same time as the Epistle to the Colossians (which in many points it resembles) and the Epistle to Philemon. However, many critical scholars have questioned the authorship of the letter and suggest that it may have been written between AD 80 and 100.\nAuthorship.\nThe first verse in the letter identifies Paul as its author. While early lists of New Testament books, including the Muratorian fragment and possibly Marcion's canon (if it is to be equated with the Epistle to the Laodiceans), attribute the letter to Paul, more recently there have been challenges to Pauline authorship on the basis of the letter's characteristically non-Pauline syntax, terminology, and eschatology.\nBiblical scholar Harold Hoehner, surveying 279 commentaries written between 1519 and 2001, found that 54% favored Pauline authorship, 39% concluded against Pauline authorship and 7% remained uncertain. Norman Perrin and Dennis C. Duling found that of six authoritative scholarly references, \"four of the six decide for pseudonymity, and the other two (Peake's Commentary on the Bible and the Jerome Biblical Commentary) recognize the difficulties in maintaining Pauline authorship. Indeed, the difficulties are insurmountable.\" Bible scholar Raymond E. Brown asserts that about 80% of critical scholarship judges that Paul did not write Ephesians.\nThere are four main theories in biblical scholarship that address the question of Pauline authorship.\nPlace, date, and purpose of the writing of the letter.\nWhile most English translations indicate that the letter was addressed to \"the saints who are in Ephesus\" (1:1), the words \"in Ephesus\" do not appear in the best and earliest manuscripts of the letter, leading most textual critics, like Bart Ehrman, to regard the words as an interpolation. This lack of any internal references to Ephesus in the early manuscripts may have led Marcion, a second-century heresiarch who created the first New Testament canon, to believe that the letter was actually addressed to the church at Laodicea, for details see Epistle to the Laodiceans.\nFurthermore, if Paul is regarded as the author, the impersonal character of the letter, which lacks personal greetings or any indication that the author has personal knowledge of his recipients, is incongruous with the account in Acts of Paul staying more than two years in Ephesus. For these reasons, most regard Ephesians to be a circular letter intended for many churches. The Jerusalem Bible notes that some critics think the words \"who are\u2026\" would have been followed by a blank to be filled in with the name of \"whichever church was being sent the letter\".\nIf Paul was the author of the letter, then it was probably written from Rome during Paul's first imprisonment, and probably soon after his arrival there in the year 62, four years after he had parted with the Ephesian elders at Miletus. However, scholars who dispute Paul's authorship date the letter to between 70 and 80 AD. In the latter case, the possible location of the authorship could have been within the church of Ephesus itself. Ignatius of Antioch himself seemed to be very well versed in the epistle to the Ephesians, and mirrors many of his own thoughts in his own epistle to the Ephesians.\nOutline.\nEphesians contains:\nFounding of the church at Ephesus.\nPaul's first and hurried visit for the space of three months to Ephesus is recorded in Acts 18:19\u201321. The work he began on this occasion was carried forward by Apollos and Aquila and Priscilla. On his second visit early in the following year, he remained at Ephesus \"three years\", for he found it was the key to the western provinces of Asia Minor. Here \"a great door and effectual\" was opened to him, and the church was established and strengthened by his diligent labours there. From Ephesus the gospel spread abroad \"almost throughout all Asia.\" The word \"mightily grew and prevailed\" despite all the opposition and persecution he encountered.\nOn his last journey to Jerusalem, the apostle landed at Miletus and, summoning together the elders of the church from Ephesus, delivered to them a farewell charge, expecting to see them no more.\nThe following parallels between this epistle and the Milesian charge may be traced:\nPurpose.\nThe purpose of the epistle, and to whom it was written, are matters of much speculation. It was regarded by C.H. Dodd as the \"crown of Paulinism.\" In general, it is born out of its particular socio-historical context and the situational context of both the author and the audience. Originating in the circumstance of a multicultural church (primarily Jewish and Hellenistic), the author addressed issues appropriate to the diverse religious and cultural backgrounds present in the community.\nThe author exhorts the church repeatedly to embrace a specific view of salvation, which he then explicates.\nFrank Charles Thompson, argues that the main theme of Ephesians is in response to the newly converted Jews who often separated themselves from their Gentile brethren. The unity of the church, especially between Jew and Gentile believers, is the keynote of the book.\nInterpretations.\nEphesians is notable for its domestic code treatment in Ephesians 5:22-6:9, covering husband-wife, parent-child, and master-slave relationships. In Ephesians 5:22, wives are urged to submit to their husbands, and husbands to love their wives \"as Christ loved the Church.\" Christian Egalitarian theologians, such as Katharine Bushnell and Jessie Penn-Lewis, interpret these commands in the context of the preceding verse, for all Christians to \"submit to one another.\" Thus, it is two-way, mutual submission of both husbands to wives and wives to husbands. But according to Peter O'Brien, Professor Emeritus at Moore Theological College, this would be the only instance of this meaning of submission in the whole New Testament, indeed in any extant comparable Greek texts; by O'Brien's account, the word simply does not connote mutuality. Dallas Theological Seminary professor Daniel Wallace understands it to be an extension of Ephesians 5:15-21 on being filled by the Holy Spirit.\nIn the period leading up to the American Civil War (1861\u201365), Ephesians 6:5 on master-slave relationships was one of the Bible verses used by Confederate slaveholders in support of a slaveholding position."}

Such behavior frequently includes things like gaining control of a computer system, allowing privilege escalation, or a denial-of-service (DoS or related DDoS) attack.\nClassification.\nThere are several methods of classifying exploits. The most common is by how the exploit communicates to the vulnerable software.\nA \"remote exploit\" works over a network and exploits the security vulnerability without any prior access to the vulnerable system.\nA \"local exploit\" requires prior access to the vulnerable system and usually increases the privileges of the person running the exploit past those granted by the system administrator. Exploits against client applications also exist, usually consisting of modified servers that send an exploit if accessed with a client application.\nExploits against client applications may also require some interaction with the user and thus may be used in combination with the social engineering method. Another classification is by the action against the vulnerable system; unauthorized data access, arbitrary code execution, and denial of service are examples.\nMany exploits are designed to provide superuser-level access to a computer system. However, it is also possible to use several exploits, first to gain low-level access, then to escalate privileges repeatedly until one reaches the highest administrative level (often called \"root\").\nAfter an exploit is made known to the authors of the affected software, the vulnerability is often fixed through a patch and the exploit becomes unusable. That is the reason why some black hat hackers as well as military or intelligence agencies hackers do not publish their exploits but keep them private.\nExploits unknown to everyone but the people that found and developed them are referred to as \"zero day exploits\".\nTypes.\nExploitations are commonly categorized and named by the type of vulnerability they exploit (see vulnerabilities for a list), whether they are local/remote and the result of running the exploit (e.g. EoP, DoS, spoofing).\nPivoting.\nPivoting refers to a method used by penetration testers that uses the compromised system to attack other systems on the same network to avoid restrictions such as firewall configurations, which may prohibit direct access to all machines. For example, if an attacker compromises a web server on a corporate network, the attacker can then use the compromised web server to attack other systems on the network. These types of attacks are often called multi-layered attacks. Pivoting is also known as \"island hopping\".\nPivoting can further be distinguished into proxy pivoting and VPN pivoting. Proxy pivoting generally describes the practice of channeling traffic through a compromised target using a proxy payload on the machine and launching attacks from the computer. This type of pivoting is restricted to certain TCP and UDP ports that are supported by the proxy.\nVPN pivoting enables the attacker to create an encrypted layer to tunnel into the compromised machine to route any network traffic through that target machine, for example, to run a vulnerability scan on the internal network through the compromised machine, effectively giving the attacker full network access as if they were behind the firewall.\nTypically, the proxy or VPN applications enabling pivoting are executed on the target computer as the payload of an exploit.\nPivoting is usually done by infiltrating a part of a network infrastructure (as an example, a vulnerable printer or thermostat) and using a scanner to find other devices connected to attack them. By attacking a vulnerable piece of networking, an attacker could infect most or all of a network and gain complete control."}

It originated in the centimetre\u2013gram\u2013second (CGS) system of units. It has the symbol \"erg\". The erg is not an SI unit. Its name is derived from (), a Greek word meaning 'work' or 'task'.\nAn erg is the amount of work done by a force of one dyne exerted for a distance of one centimetre. In the CGS base units, it is equal to one gram centimetre-squared per second-squared (g\u22c5cm2/s2). It is thus equal to 10\u22127 joules or 100 nanojoules (nJ) in SI units. An erg is approximately the amount of work done (or energy consumed) by one common house fly performing one \"push up\", the leg-bending dip that brings its mouth to the surface on which it stands and back up.\nHistory.\nIn 1864, Rudolf Clausius proposed the Greek word () for the unit of energy, work and heat. In 1873, a committee of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, including British physicists James Clerk Maxwell and William Thomson recommended the general adoption of the centimetre, the gramme, and the second as fundamental units (C.G.S. System of Units). To distinguish derived units, they recommended using the prefix \"C.G.S. unit of ...\" and requested that the word \"erg\" or \"ergon\" be strictly limited to refer to the \"C.G.S. unit of energy\".\nIn 1922, chemist William Draper Harkins proposed the name micri-erg as a convenient unit to measure the surface energy of molecules in surface chemistry. It would equate to 10\u221214\u00a0erg, the equivalent to 10\u221221\u00a0joule.\nThe erg has not been a valid unit since 1 January 1978 when the EEC ratified a directive of 1971 which implemented the International System (SI) as agreed by the General Conference of Weights and Measures. It is still widely used in astrophysics and sometimes in mechanics."}

Its lead designer was Jonathan Tweet. Marketed as a \"Visionary Roleplaying Game\", it has often been characterized as an innovative piece with a limited commercial success. Wizards later abandoned the line, and Rubicon Games purchased it, and published several supplements. The line was sold again to Gaslight Press in February 2001. The line is currently with The Everway Company, which is working on both a Silver Anniversary Edition and 2nd Edition. \nThe game has a fantasy setting of the multiverse type, with many different worlds, some of which differed from generic fantasy. It appears to have been heavily influenced by divinatory tarot, the four classical elements of ancient Greece, and mythologies from around the world.\nEverway was first with implementing, in a commercial game, several new concepts including much more picture-based/visual source material and character creation than usual. Like other works by Jonathan Tweet, the rules are very simple and flexible. It is also one of a few diceless role-playing games. The Fortune Deck works as a randomizer and inspirational tool, and the results obtained by it are highly subjective. In order to clarify their use, Tweet coined some new vocabulary to describe and formalize methods of gamemaster adjudication; these terms have been adopted by the wider tabletop RPG community. Tweet's adjudication terms are: Karma (making a decision based on character abilities, tactics, and the internal logic of a fictional situation), Drama (making a decision based on what moves the story along), and Fortune (letting a randomizer \u2014 drawing a card in \"Everway\", but could also refer to rolling dice in other games \u2014 determine the outcome). \nDescription.\n\"Everway\" was a boxed set designed by Jonathan Tweet, Jenny Scott, Aron Anderson, Scott Hungerford, Kathy Ice, Bob Kruger, and John Tynes, with illustrations by Doug Alexander, Rick Berry, Daniel Gelon, Janine Johnston, Hannibal King, Scott Kirschner, Ed Lee, John Matson, Martin McKenna, Ian Miller, Jeff Miracola, Roger Raupp, Andrew Robinson, Christopher Rush, and Amy Weber, and cover art by Susan Harris\nThe components included:\nSetting.\nThe official setting for Everway revolves around heroes with the power of \"spherewalking,\" traveling between worlds called \"spheres.\" Spheres typically consist of many \"realms.\" The city of Everway is located in a realm called Roundwander, in the sphere called Fourcorner. Roundwander is the only realm in Fourcorner that is described. There is some detail on the sphere's main city, Everway, which contains a stone pyramid, a set of family-oriented guilds, and various exotic events related to the city's position as an inter-dimensional trading center. Several dozen other spheres are described as one-sentence blurbs, a few as page-long summaries, and one in detail as the setting for a sample adventure, \"Journey to Stonekeep.\" The theme is strongly fantasy-oriented as opposed to science fictional, with advanced technology explicitly forbidden in the character creation rules. The authors gave significant thought to anthropology by describing how the people of various spheres live, including many similarities across cultures. Some of these common features are entirely realistic (language, art), and others plainly related to the game's fantasy elements (magic, knowledge of the Fortune Deck). Nearly all spheres are inhabited by humans, with mostly realistic physics.\nCharacter creation.\nCharacter design is abstract and simple by most role-playing games' standards. Each character begins with twenty points to divide between four Element scores roughly equivalent to statistics for Strength (Fire), Perception (Water), Intelligence (Air) and Endurance (Earth). Scores range from 1 (pathetic) to 3 (average) to 10 (godlike), so a generic hero would have scores of 5. Each Element also has a specialty for which a character can get a 1-point bonus; e.g., a 5-Air hero with an Air specialty of \"Writing\" could write as though their Air score were 6. As a general rule a statistic of N is twice as capable as a level of N-1, where this makes sense. (A 5-Fire, 5-Earth hero can typically defeat two 4-Fire, 5-Earth enemies, or handily defeat a 3-Fire, 5-Earth character in foot race, but cannot necessarily run twice as fast even though speed is governed by Fire.)\nEach character also has Powers representing unusual abilities. These cost from 0 to 3 or more points depending on whether they should be considered Frequent, Major (or even \"Twice Major\", for especially powerful abilities that significantly affect gameplay) and/or Versatile. For instance, a \"Cat Familiar,\" a slightly intelligent cat, is arguably worth 2 points for being Frequent (usually around and often useful) and Versatile (able to scout, carry messages, and fight). A \"Winning Smile\" that makes the hero likable is worth 0 points because of its trivial effect, while a \"Charming Song\" that inspires one emotion when played might be useful enough to count as Frequent (1 point). There is no strict rule for deciding what a Power is worth. Each hero can have one 0-point Power for free; additional Powers that would otherwise cost 0 points instead cost 1.\nMagic is also abstract. A hero wanting access to magic, as opposed to a few specific Powers, must design their own magic system. This is done by choosing an Element for its basis, which affects its theme; e.g., Air is associated with speech and intellect and would be suitable for a system of spoken spells gained through study. The new Magic statistic has a 1\u201310 rating and point cost, and can be no higher than the Element on what it is based. The game's rules suggest listing examples of what the magic system can do at each power level, working these out with the GM. It is suggested that most characters do not need magic and that it is not suitable for new players.\nFinally, each hero has personality traits based on the game's Fortune and Vision cards. Players are to choose one or more Vision cards and base a backstory on them, and to have three Fortune cards representing a Virtue, Fault, and Fate (a challenge they will face). These three cards can change to represent new phases in the hero's life. There is a list of suggested Motives for why the hero is adventuring, such as \"Adversity\" or \"Wanderlust\", but this feature has no gameplay effect.\nEquipment such as weaponry is handled completely abstractly, with no specific rules for item cost, carrying capacity, or combat statistics. However, a particularly powerful piece of equipment\u2014for example, a cloak that renders its wearer invisible for a brief period\u2014may be treated as a Power that the hero must spend their initial element points on.\nThe Fortune Deck.\nTo decide what happens, the GM considers the rules of Karma (characters' abilities, tactics, logic), Drama (the needs of the plot), and Fortune, the result of a card drawn from the Fortune Deck. Many of these cards are based on the \"Major Arcana\" of tarot divination, such as \"The Fool\" and \"Death\", but the deck includes original cards such as \"Drowning in Armor\" and \"Law.\" As with the Tarot deck there is symbolic art and each card has two complementary meanings when upright or reversed (while face up). The meanings are printed on the cards (e.g., \"Protective Measures Turn Dangerous\" vs. \"True Prudence\" for \"Drowning in Armor\") and explained more fully in the game's books. The rules are flexible about how often the GM should consult the Fortune Deck, whether the cards should be shown to players, and how much influence the draw should have\u2014it is entirely acceptable for the GM to never use the deck at all, if she so desires. Though cards sometimes have obvious interpretations for the context in which they are drawn, the rules explain that sometimes they are best read simply as \"a positive (or negative) result.\"\nAlthough the Fortune Deck resembles (and can be used as) a fortune-telling device, Everway treats the Deck only as a storytelling device and an element of the fictional setting. It does not in any way endorse \"real\" fortune-telling or other supernatural concepts.\nReception.\nIn the December 1995 edition of \"Dragon\" (Issue 224), Rick Swan was surprised by Wizard of the Coast's choice of the very different \"Everway\" to enter the role-playing game market: \"Everway is so far out of the mainstream, it\u2019s barely recognizable as an RPG. For starters, it has no dice. It has no tables or charts. A deck of cards directs the flow of the game. Monster bashing, treasure hunting, dungeon crawling\u2014bye-bye; \"Everway\" is pure narrative.\" Swan liked the \"first class\" production values of the components, but found the maps \"lifeless\". Swan was a big fan of the diceless system, saying, \"It makes for a brisk game, and Everway, to its credit, plays at blinding speed.\" But Swan was concerned by the how the game placed an unreasonable onus on the improvisational skills of both the gamemaster and the players. He concluded by giving the game an average rating of 4 out of 6."}

The chassis consists of a series of slotted card guides on the top and bottom, into which the cards are slid so they stand on end, like books on a shelf. At the spine of each card is one or more connectors which plug into mating connectors on a backplane that closes the rear of the chassis.\nDimensions.\nAs the cards are assumed to be installed in a vertical orientation, the usual meanings of height and width are transposed: A card might be 233.35\u00a0mm \"high\", but only 20\u00a0mm \"wide\". Height is measured in rack units, \"U\", with 1 U being . This dimension refers to the subrack in which the card is to be mounted, rather than the card itself. \nEnclosure heights are multiples of 3U, with the cards always shorter than the enclosure. Two common heights are 3U (a 100\u00a0mm card in a subrack) and 6U (a 233.35\u00a0mm card in a high subrack). As two 3U cards are shorter than a 6U card (by 33.35\u00a0mm), it is possible to install two 3U cards in one slot of a 6U subrack, with a mid-height structure for proper support.\nCard widths are specified in horizontal pitch units \"HP\", with 1 HP being .\nCard depths start at and increase in increments. The most common today is , but standard hardware is available for depths of , , , , , and .\nStandards and architecture.\nThe Eurocard mechanical architecture was defined originally under IEC-60297-3. Today, the most widely recognized standards for this mechanical structure are IEEE 1101.1, IEEE 1101.10 (also known commonly as \"dot ten\") and IEEE 1101.11. IEEE 1101.10 covers the additional mechanical and electromagnetic interference features required for VITA 1.1-1997(R2002), which is the VME64 Extensions standard, as well as PICMG 2.0 (R3.0), which is the CompactPCI specification.\nThe IEEE 1101.11 standard covers rear plug-in units that are also called rear transition modules or RTMs.\nThe Eurocard is a mechanical system and does not define the specific connector to be used or the signals that are assigned to connector contacts.\nThe connector systems that are commonly used with Eurocard architectures include the original DIN 41612 connector that is also standardized as IEC 60603.2. This is the connector that is used for the VMEbus standard, which was IEEE 1014. The connector known as the 5-row DIN, which is used for the VME64 Extensions standard is IEC 61076-4-113. The VME64 Extension architecture defined by VITA 1.1-1997 (R2002).\nAnother popular computer architecture that utilizes the 6U-160 Eurocard is CompactPCI and CompactPCI Express. These are defined by PICMG 2.0R3 and PICMG Exp0 R1 respectively. Other computer architectures that utilize the Eurocard system are VME eXtensions for Instrumentation (VXI), PCI eXtensions for Instrumentation (PXI), and PXI Express.\nA computer architecture that used the 6U-220 Eurocard format was Multibus-II, which was IEEE 1296.\nBecause the Eurocard system provided for so many modular card sizes and because connector manufacturers have continued to create new connectors that are compatible with this system, it is a popular mechanical standard that is also used for innumerable \"one-off\" applications.\nConduction-cooled Eurocards are used in military and aerospace applications. They are defined by the IEEE 1101.2-1992 (2001) standard.\nThe Eurocard standard is also the basis of the \"Eurorack\" format for modular electronic music synthesizers, popularized by Doepfer and other manufacturers."}

Many rules in chemistry rely on electron-counting:\nAtoms are called \"electron-deficient\" when they have too few electrons as compared to their respective rules, or \"hypervalent\" when they have too many electrons. Since these compounds tend to be more reactive than compounds that obey their rule, electron counting is an important tool for identifying the reactivity of molecules.\nCounting rules.\nTwo methods of electron counting are popular and both give the same result. \nIt is important, though, to be aware that most chemical species exist between the purely covalent and ionic extremes.\nElectrons donated by common fragments.\n\"Special cases\".\nThe numbers of electrons \"donated\" by some ligands depends on the geometry of the metal-ligand ensemble. An example of this complication is the M\u2013NO entity. When this grouping is linear, the NO ligand is considered to be a three-electron ligand. When the M\u2013NO subunit is strongly bent at N, the NO is treated as a pseudohalide and is thus a one electron (in the neutral counting approach). The situation is not very different from the \"\u03b7\"3 versus the \"\u03b7\"1 allyl. Another unusual ligand from the electron counting perspective is sulfur dioxide. \nExamples.\nThese examples show the methods of electron counting, they are a \"formalism\", and don't have anything to do with \"real life\" chemical transformations. Most of the 'fragments' mentioned above do not exist as such; they cannot be kept in a bottle: e.g. the neutral C, the tetraanionic C, the neutral Ti, and the tetracationic Ti are not \"free\" species, they are always bound to something, for neutral C, it is commonly found in graphite, charcoal, diamond (sharing electrons with the neighboring carbons), as for Ti which can be found as its metal (where it shares its electrons with neighboring Ti atoms), C4\u2212 and Ti4+ 'exist' only with appropriate counterions (with which they probably share electrons). So these formalisms are only used to predict stabilities or properties of compounds!"}
{"id": "9891", "revid": "16163846", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9891", "title": "Entropy", "text": "Entropy is a scientific concept, as well as a measurable physical property that is most commonly associated with a state of disorder, randomness, or uncertainty. The term and the concept are used in diverse fields, from classical thermodynamics, where it was first recognized, to the microscopic description of nature in statistical physics, and to the principles of information theory. It has found far-ranging applications in chemistry and physics, in biological systems and their relation to life, in cosmology, economics, sociology, weather science, climate change, and information systems including the transmission of information in telecommunication.\nThe thermodynamic concept was referred to by Scottish scientist and engineer Macquorn Rankine in 1850 with the names \"thermodynamic function\" and \"heat-potential\". In 1865, German physicist Rudolph Clausius, one of the leading founders of the field of thermodynamics, defined it as the quotient of an infinitesimal amount of heat to the instantaneous temperature. He initially described it as \"transformation-content\", in German \"Verwandlungsinhalt\", and later coined the term \"entropy\" from a Greek word for \"transformation\". Referring to microscopic constitution and structure, in 1862, Clausius interpreted the concept as meaning \"disgregation\".\nEntropy predicts that certain processes are irreversible or impossible, aside from the requirement of not violating the conservation of energy, the latter being expressed in the first law of thermodynamics. Entropy is central to the second law of thermodynamics, which states that the entropy of isolated systems left to spontaneous evolution cannot decrease with time, as they always arrive at a state of thermodynamic equilibrium, where the entropy is highest.\nAustrian physicist Ludwig Boltzmann explained entropy as the measure of the number of possible microscopic arrangements or states of individual atoms and molecules of a system that comply with the macroscopic condition of the system. He thereby introduced the concept of statistical disorder and probability distributions into a new field of thermodynamics, called statistical mechanics, and found the link between the microscopic interactions, which fluctuate about an average configuration, to the macroscopically observable behavior, in form of a simple logarithmic law, with a proportionality constant, the Boltzmann constant, that has become one of the defining universal constants for the modern International System of Units (SI).\nIn 1948, Bell Labs scientist Claude Shannon developed similar statistical concepts of measuring microscopic uncertainty and multiplicity to the problem of random losses of information in telecommunication signals. Upon John von Neumann's suggestion, Shannon named this entity of \"missing information\" in analogous manner to its use in statistical mechanics as \"entropy\", and gave birth to the field of information theory. This description has been proposed as a universal definition of the concept of entropy.\nHistory.\nIn his 1803 paper, \"Fundamental Principles of Equilibrium and Movement\", the French mathematician Lazare Carnot proposed that in any machine the accelerations and shocks of the moving parts represent losses of \"moment of activity\"; in any natural process there exists an inherent tendency towards the dissipation of useful energy. In 1824, building on that work, Lazare's son, Sadi Carnot, published \"Reflections on the Motive Power of Fire\", which posited that in all heat-engines, whenever \"caloric\" (what is now known as heat) falls through a temperature difference, work or motive power can be produced from the actions of its fall from a hot to cold body. He used an analogy with how water falls in a water wheel. That was an early insight into the second law of thermodynamics. Carnot based his views of heat partially on the early 18th-century \"Newtonian hypothesis\" that both heat and light were types of indestructible forms of matter, which are attracted and repelled by other matter, and partially on the contemporary views of Count Rumford, who showed in 1789 that heat could be created by friction, as when cannon bores are machined. Carnot reasoned that if the body of the working substance, such as a body of steam, is returned to its original state at the end of a complete engine cycle, \"no change occurs in the condition of the working body\".\nThe first law of thermodynamics, deduced from the heat-friction experiments of James Joule in 1843, expresses the concept of energy, and its conservation in all processes; the first law, however, is unable to quantify the effects of friction and dissipation.\nIn the 1850s and 1860s, German physicist Rudolf Clausius objected to the supposition that no change occurs in the working body, and gave that change a mathematical interpretation, by questioning the nature of the inherent loss of usable heat when work is done, e.g., heat produced by friction. He described his observations as a dissipative use of energy, resulting in a \"transformation-content\" (\"Verwandlungsinhalt\" in German), of a thermodynamic system or working body of chemical species during a change of state. That was in contrast to earlier views, based on the theories of Isaac Newton, that heat was an indestructible particle that had mass. Clausius discovered that the non-useable energy increases as steam proceeds from inlet to exhaust in a steam engine. From the Greek word for \"transformation\" (\"entropia\"), in 1865, he coined the name of that property as \"entropy\". The word was adopted into the English language in 1868.\nLater, scientists such as Ludwig Boltzmann, Josiah Willard Gibbs, and James Clerk Maxwell gave entropy a statistical basis. In 1877, Boltzmann visualized a probabilistic way to measure the entropy of an ensemble of ideal gas particles, in which he defined entropy as proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of microstates such a gas could occupy. Henceforth, the essential problem in statistical thermodynamics has been to determine the distribution of a given amount of energy \"E\" over \"N\" identical systems. Constantin Carath\u00e9odory, the Greek mathematician, linked entropy with a mathematical definition of irreversibility, in terms of trajectories and integrability.\nEtymology.\nIn 1865, Clausius named the concept of \"the differential of a quantity which depends on the configuration of the system,\" \"entropy\" () after the Greek word for 'transformation'. He gives \"transformational content\" () as a synonym, paralleling his \"thermal and ergonal content\" () as the name of , but preferring the term \"entropy\" as a close parallel of the word \"energy\", as he found the concepts nearly \"analogous in their physical significance.\" This term was formed by replacing the root of ('work') by that of ('transformation').\nDefinitions and descriptions.\nThe concept of entropy is described by two principal approaches, the macroscopic perspective of classical thermodynamics, and the microscopic description central to statistical mechanics. The classical approach defines entropy in terms of macroscopically measurable physical properties, such as bulk mass, volume, pressure, and temperature. The statistical definition of entropy defines it in terms of the statistics of the motions of the microscopic constituents of a system \u2013 modeled at first classically, e.g. Newtonian particles constituting a gas, and later quantum-mechanically (photons, phonons, spins, etc.). The two approaches form a consistent, unified view of the same phenomenon as expressed in the second law of thermodynamics, which has found universal applicability to physical processes.\nFunction of state.\nMany thermodynamic properties have a special characteristic in that they form a set of physical variables that define a state of equilibrium; they are functions of state. Often, if two properties of a system are determined, they are sufficient to determine the state of the system and thus other properties' values. For instance, a given quantity, temperature and pressure of gas determine its state and thus also its volume. As another example, a system composed of a pure substance of a single phase at a particular uniform temperature and pressure is determined (and is thus a particular state) and is at not only a particular volume but also at a particular entropy. The fact that entropy is a function of state is one reason it is useful. In the Carnot cycle, the working fluid returns to the same state it had at the start of the cycle, hence the line integral of any state function, such as entropy, over this reversible cycle is zero.\nReversible process.\nEntropy is conserved for a reversible process. A reversible process is one that does not deviate from thermodynamic equilibrium, while producing the maximum work. Any process that happens quickly enough to deviate from thermal equilibrium cannot be reversible. In these cases energy is lost to heat, total entropy increases, and the potential for maximum work to be done in the transition is also lost. More specifically, total entropy is conserved in a reversible process and not conserved in an irreversible process. For example, in the Carnot cycle, while the heat flow from the hot reservoir to the cold reservoir represents an increase in entropy, the work output, if reversibly and perfectly stored in some energy storage mechanism, represents a decrease in entropy that could be used to operate the heat engine in reverse and return to the previous state, thus the \"total\" entropy change is still zero at all times if the entire process is reversible. An irreversible process increases entropy.\nCarnot cycle.\nThe concept of entropy arose from Rudolf Clausius's study of the Carnot cycle. In a Carnot cycle, heat is absorbed isothermally at temperature from a 'hot' reservoir and given up isothermally as heat to a 'cold' reservoir at . According to Carnot's principle, work can only be produced by the system when there is a temperature difference, and the work should be some function of the difference in temperature and the heat absorbed (). Carnot did not distinguish between and , since he was using the incorrect hypothesis that caloric theory was valid, and hence heat was conserved (the incorrect assumption that and were equal) when, in fact, is greater than . Through the efforts of Clausius and Kelvin, it is now known that the maximum work that a heat engine can produce is the product of the Carnot efficiency and the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir:\nTo derive the Carnot efficiency, which is (a number less than one), Kelvin had to evaluate the ratio of the work output to the heat absorbed during the isothermal expansion with the help of the Carnot\u2013Clapeyron equation, which contained an unknown function called the Carnot function. The possibility that the Carnot function could be the temperature as measured from a zero temperature, was suggested by Joule in a letter to Kelvin. This allowed Kelvin to establish his absolute temperature scale. It is also known that the work produced by the system is the difference between the heat absorbed from the hot reservoir and the heat given up to the cold reservoir:\nSince the latter is valid over the entire cycle, this gave Clausius the hint that at each stage of the cycle, work and heat would not be equal, but rather their difference would be a state function that would vanish upon completion of the cycle. The state function was called the internal energy and it became the first law of thermodynamics.\nNow equating () and () gives\nor\nThis implies that there is a function of state that is conserved over a complete cycle of the Carnot cycle. Clausius called this state function \"entropy\". One can see that entropy was discovered through mathematics rather than through laboratory results. It is a mathematical construct and has no easy physical analogy. This makes the concept somewhat obscure or abstract, akin to how the concept of energy arose.\nClausius then asked what would happen if there should be less work produced by the system than that predicted by Carnot's principle. The right-hand side of the first equation would be the upper bound of the work output by the system, which would now be converted into an inequality\nWhen the second equation is used to express the work as a difference in heats, we get\nSo more heat is given up to the cold reservoir than in the Carnot cycle. If we denote the entropies by for the two states, then the above inequality can be written as a decrease in the entropy\nThe entropy that leaves the system is greater than the entropy that enters the system, implying that some irreversible process prevents the cycle from producing the maximum amount of work predicted by the Carnot equation.\nThe Carnot cycle and efficiency are useful because they define the upper bound of the possible work output and the efficiency of any classical thermodynamic system. Other cycles, such as the Otto cycle, Diesel cycle and Brayton cycle, can be analyzed from the standpoint of the Carnot cycle. Any machine or process that converts heat to work and is claimed to produce an efficiency greater than the Carnot efficiency is not viable because it violates the second law of thermodynamics. For very small numbers of particles in the system, statistical thermodynamics must be used. The efficiency of devices such as photovoltaic cells requires an analysis from the standpoint of quantum mechanics.\nClassical thermodynamics.\nThe thermodynamic definition of entropy was developed in the early 1850s by Rudolf Clausius and essentially describes how to measure the entropy of an isolated system in thermodynamic equilibrium with its parts. Clausius created the term entropy as an extensive thermodynamic variable that was shown to be useful in characterizing the Carnot cycle. Heat transfer along the isotherm steps of the Carnot cycle was found to be proportional to the temperature of a system (known as its absolute temperature). This relationship was expressed in increments of entropy equal to the ratio of incremental heat transfer divided by temperature, which was found to vary in the thermodynamic cycle but eventually return to the same value at the end of every cycle. Thus it was found to be a function of state, specifically a thermodynamic state of the system.\nWhile Clausius based his definition on a reversible process, there are also irreversible processes that change entropy. Following the second law of thermodynamics, entropy of an isolated system always increases for irreversible processes. The difference between an isolated system and closed system is that heat may \"not\" flow to and from an isolated system, but heat flow to and from a closed system is possible. Nevertheless, for both closed and isolated systems, and indeed, also in open systems, irreversible thermodynamics processes may occur.\nAccording to the Clausius equality, for a reversible cyclic process: formula_8.\nThis means the line integral formula_9 is path-independent.\nSo we can define a state function called entropy, which satisfies formula_10.\nTo find the entropy difference between any two states of a system, the integral must be evaluated for some reversible path between the initial and final states. Since entropy is a state function, the entropy change of the system for an irreversible path is the same as for a reversible path between the same two states. However, the entropy change of the surroundings is different.\nWe can only obtain the change of entropy by integrating the above formula. To obtain the absolute value of the entropy, we need the third law of thermodynamics, which states that \"S\" = 0 at absolute zero for perfect crystals.\nFrom a macroscopic perspective, in classical thermodynamics the entropy is interpreted as a state function of a thermodynamic system: that is, a property depending only on the current state of the system, independent of how that state came to be achieved. In any process where the system gives up energy \u0394\"E\", and its entropy falls by \u0394\"S\", a quantity at least \"T\"R \u0394\"S\" of that energy must be given up to the system's surroundings as unusable heat (\"T\"R is the temperature of the system's external surroundings). Otherwise the process cannot go forward. In classical thermodynamics, the entropy of a system is defined only if it is in thermodynamic equilibrium.\nStatistical mechanics.\nThe statistical definition was developed by Ludwig Boltzmann in the 1870s by analyzing the statistical behavior of the microscopic components of the system. Boltzmann showed that this definition of entropy was equivalent to the thermodynamic entropy to within a constant factor\u2014known as Boltzmann's constant. In summary, the thermodynamic definition of entropy provides the experimental definition of entropy, while the statistical definition of entropy extends the concept, providing an explanation and a deeper understanding of its nature.\nThe interpretation of entropy in statistical mechanics is the measure of uncertainty, or \"mixedupness\" in the phrase of Gibbs, which remains about a system after its observable macroscopic properties, such as temperature, pressure and volume, have been taken into account. For a given set of macroscopic variables, the entropy measures the degree to which the probability of the system is spread out over different possible microstates. In contrast to the macrostate, which characterizes plainly observable average quantities, a microstate specifies all molecular details about the system including the position and velocity of every molecule. The more such states available to the system with appreciable probability, the greater the entropy. In statistical mechanics, entropy is a measure of the number of ways a system can be arranged, often taken to be a measure of \"disorder\" (the higher the entropy, the higher the disorder). This definition describes the entropy as being proportional to the natural logarithm of the number of possible microscopic configurations of the individual atoms and molecules of the system (microstates) that could cause the observed macroscopic state (macrostate) of the system. The constant of proportionality is the Boltzmann constant.\nBoltzmann's constant, and therefore entropy, have dimensions of energy divided by temperature, which has a unit of joules per kelvin (J\u22c5K\u22121) in the International System of Units (or kg\u22c5m2\u22c5s\u22122\u22c5K\u22121 in terms of base units). The entropy of a substance is usually given as an intensive propertyeither entropy per unit mass (SI unit: J\u22c5K\u22121\u22c5kg\u22121) or entropy per unit amount of substance (SI unit: J\u22c5K\u22121\u22c5mol\u22121).\nSpecifically, entropy is a logarithmic measure of the number of states with significant probability of being occupied:\n(formula_12 is the probability that the system is in formula_13th state; if states are defined in a continuous manner, the summation is replaced by an integral over all possible states) or, equivalently, the expected value of the logarithm of the probability that a microstate is occupied\nwhere \"k\"B is the Boltzmann constant, equal to .\nThe summation is over all the possible microstates of the system, and \"pi\" is the probability that the system is in the \"i\"-th microstate. This definition assumes that the basis set of states has been picked so that there is no information on their relative phases. In a different basis set, the more general expression is\nwhere formula_16 is the density matrix, formula_17 is trace and formula_18 is the matrix logarithm. This density matrix formulation is not needed in cases of thermal equilibrium so long as the basis states are chosen to be energy eigenstates. For most practical purposes, this can be taken as the fundamental definition of entropy since all other formulas for \"S\" can be mathematically derived from it, but not vice versa.\nIn what has been called \"the fundamental assumption of statistical thermodynamics\" or \"the fundamental postulate in statistical mechanics\", the occupation of any microstate is assumed to be equally probable (i.e. \"p\"\"i\" = 1/\u03a9, where \u03a9 is the number of microstates); this assumption is usually justified for an isolated system in equilibrium. Then the previous equation reduces to\nIn thermodynamics, such a system is one in which the volume, number of molecules, and internal energy are fixed (the microcanonical ensemble).\nFor a given thermodynamic system, the \"excess entropy\" is defined as the entropy minus that of an ideal gas at the same density and temperature, a quantity that is always negative because an ideal gas is maximally disordered. This concept plays an important role in liquid-state theory. For instance, Rosenfeld's excess-entropy scaling principle states that reduced transport coefficients throughout the two-dimensional phase diagram are functions uniquely determined by the excess entropy.\nThe most general interpretation of entropy is as a measure of our uncertainty about a system. The equilibrium state of a system maximizes the entropy because we have lost all information about the initial conditions except for the conserved variables; maximizing the entropy maximizes our ignorance about the details of the system. This uncertainty is not of the everyday subjective kind, but rather the uncertainty inherent to the experimental method and interpretative model.\nThe interpretative model has a central role in determining entropy. The qualifier \"for a given set of macroscopic variables\" above has deep implications: if two observers use different sets of macroscopic variables, they see different entropies. For example, if observer A uses the variables \"U\", \"V\" and \"W\", and observer B uses \"U\", \"V\", \"W\", \"X\", then, by changing \"X\", observer B can cause an effect that looks like a violation of the second law of thermodynamics to observer A. In other words: the set of macroscopic variables one chooses must include everything that may change in the experiment, otherwise one might see decreasing entropy.\nEntropy can be defined for any Markov processes with reversible dynamics and the detailed balance property.\nIn Boltzmann's 1896 \"Lectures on Gas Theory\", he showed that this expression gives a measure of entropy for systems of atoms and molecules in the gas phase, thus providing a measure for the entropy of classical thermodynamics.\nEntropy of a system.\nEntropy arises directly from the Carnot cycle. It can also be described as the reversible heat divided by temperature. Entropy is a fundamental function of state.\nIn a thermodynamic system, pressure, density, and temperature tend to become uniform over time because the equilibrium state has higher probability (more possible combinations of microstates) than any other state.\nAs an example, for a glass of ice water in air at room temperature, the difference in temperature between a warm room (the surroundings) and cold glass of ice and water (the system and not part of the room), begins to equalize as portions of the thermal energy from the warm surroundings spread to the cooler system of ice and water. Over time the temperature of the glass and its contents and the temperature of the room become equal. In other words, the entropy of the room has decreased as some of its energy has been dispersed to the ice and water.\nHowever, as calculated in the example, the entropy of the system of ice and water has increased more than the entropy of the surrounding room has decreased. In an isolated system such as the room and ice water taken together, the dispersal of energy from warmer to cooler always results in a net increase in entropy. Thus, when the \"universe\" of the room and ice water system has reached a temperature equilibrium, the entropy change from the initial state is at a maximum. The entropy of the thermodynamic system is a measure of how far the equalization has progressed.\nThermodynamic entropy is a non-conserved state function that is of great importance in the sciences of physics and chemistry. Historically, the concept of entropy evolved to explain why some processes (permitted by conservation laws) occur spontaneously while their time reversals (also permitted by conservation laws) do not; systems tend to progress in the direction of increasing entropy. For isolated systems, entropy never decreases. This fact has several important consequences in science: first, it prohibits \"perpetual motion\" machines; and second, it implies the arrow of entropy has the same direction as the arrow of time. Increases in entropy correspond to irreversible changes in a system, because some energy is expended as waste heat, limiting the amount of work a system can do.\nUnlike many other functions of state, entropy cannot be directly observed but must be calculated. Entropy can be calculated for a substance as the standard molar entropy from absolute zero (also known as absolute entropy) or as a difference in entropy from some other reference state defined as zero entropy. Entropy has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, which has a unit of joules per kelvin (J/K) in the International System of Units. While these are the same units as heat capacity, the two concepts are distinct. Entropy is not a conserved quantity: for example, in an isolated system with non-uniform temperature, heat might irreversibly flow and the temperature become more uniform such that entropy increases. The second law of thermodynamics states that a closed system has entropy that may increase or otherwise remain constant. Chemical reactions cause changes in entropy and entropy plays an important role in determining in which direction a chemical reaction spontaneously proceeds.\nOne dictionary definition of entropy is that it is \"a measure of thermal energy per unit temperature that is not available for useful work\". For instance, a substance at uniform temperature is at maximum entropy and cannot drive a heat engine. A substance at non-uniform temperature is at a lower entropy (than if the heat distribution is allowed to even out) and some of the thermal energy can drive a heat engine.\nA special case of entropy increase, the entropy of mixing, occurs when two or more different substances are mixed. If the substances are at the same temperature and pressure, there is no net exchange of heat or work \u2013 the entropy change is entirely due to the mixing of the different substances. At a statistical mechanical level, this results due to the change in available volume per particle with mixing.\nEquivalence of definitions.\nProofs of equivalence between the definition of entropy in statistical mechanics (the Gibbs entropy formula formula_20) and in classical thermodynamics (formula_10 together with the fundamental thermodynamic relation) are known for the microcanonical ensemble, the canonical ensemble, the grand canonical ensemble, and the isothermal\u2013isobaric ensemble. These proofs are based on the probability density of microstates of the generalized Boltzmann distribution and the identification of the thermodynamic internal energy as the ensemble average formula_22. Thermodynamic relations are then employed to derive the well-known Gibbs entropy formula. However, the equivalence between the Gibbs entropy formula and the thermodynamic definition of entropy is not a fundamental thermodynamic relation but rather a consequence of the form of the generalized Boltzmann distribution.\nSecond law of thermodynamics.\nThe second law of thermodynamics requires that, in general, the total entropy of any system does not decrease other than by increasing the entropy of some other system. Hence, in a system isolated from its environment, the entropy of that system tends not to decrease. It follows that heat cannot flow from a colder body to a hotter body without the application of work to the colder body. Secondly, it is impossible for any device operating on a cycle to produce net work from a single temperature reservoir; the production of net work requires flow of heat from a hotter reservoir to a colder reservoir, or a single expanding reservoir undergoing adiabatic cooling, which performs adiabatic work. As a result, there is no possibility of a perpetual motion system. It follows that a reduction in the increase of entropy in a specified process, such as a chemical reaction, means that it is energetically more efficient.\nIt follows from the second law of thermodynamics that the entropy of a system that is not isolated may decrease. An air conditioner, for example, may cool the air in a room, thus reducing the entropy of the air of that system. The heat expelled from the room (the system), which the air conditioner transports and discharges to the outside air, always makes a bigger contribution to the entropy of the environment than the decrease of the entropy of the air of that system. Thus, the total of entropy of the room plus the entropy of the environment increases, in agreement with the second law of thermodynamics.\nIn mechanics, the second law in conjunction with the fundamental thermodynamic relation places limits on a system's ability to do useful work. The entropy change of a system at temperature \"T\" absorbing an infinitesimal amount of heat \"\u03b4q\"\nin a reversible way, is given by \"\u03b4q\"/\"T\". More explicitly, an energy is not available to do useful work, where \"T\"R is the temperature of the coldest accessible reservoir or heat sink external to the system. For further discussion, see \"Exergy\".\nStatistical mechanics demonstrates that entropy is governed by probability, thus allowing for a decrease in disorder even in an isolated system. Although this is possible, such an event has a small probability of occurring, making it unlikely.\nThe applicability of a second law of thermodynamics is limited to systems near or in equilibrium state. At the same time, laws that govern systems far from equilibrium are still debatable. One of the guiding principles for such systems is the maximum entropy production principle. It claims that non-equilibrium systems evolve such as to maximize its entropy production.\nApplications.\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation.\nThe entropy of a system depends on its internal energy and its external parameters, such as its volume. In the thermodynamic limit, this fact leads to an equation relating the change in the internal energy \"U\" to changes in the entropy and the external parameters. This relation is known as the \"fundamental thermodynamic relation\". If external pressure \"p\" bears on the volume \"V\" as the only external parameter, this relation is:\nSince both internal energy and entropy are monotonic functions of temperature \"T\", implying that the internal energy is fixed when one specifies the entropy and the volume, this relation is valid even if the change from one state of thermal equilibrium to another with infinitesimally larger entropy and volume happens in a non-quasistatic way (so during this change the system may be very far out of thermal equilibrium and then the whole-system entropy, pressure, and temperature may not exist).\nThe fundamental thermodynamic relation implies many thermodynamic identities that are valid in general, independent of the microscopic details of the system. Important examples are the Maxwell relations and the relations between heat capacities.\nEntropy in chemical thermodynamics.\nThermodynamic entropy is central in chemical thermodynamics, enabling changes to be quantified and the outcome of reactions predicted. The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy in an isolated system \u2013 the combination of a subsystem under study and its surroundings \u2013 increases during all spontaneous chemical and physical processes. The Clausius equation of \"\u03b4q\"rev/\"T\" = \u0394\"S\" introduces the measurement of entropy change, \u0394\"S\". Entropy change describes the direction and quantifies the magnitude of simple changes such as heat transfer between systems \u2013 always from hotter to cooler spontaneously.\nThe thermodynamic entropy therefore has the dimension of energy divided by temperature, and the unit joule per kelvin (J/K) in the International System of Units (SI).\nThermodynamic entropy is an extensive property, meaning that it scales with the size or extent of a system. In many processes it is useful to specify the entropy as an intensive property independent of the size, as a specific entropy characteristic of the type of system studied. Specific entropy may be expressed relative to a unit of mass, typically the kilogram (unit: J\u22c5kg\u22121\u22c5K\u22121). Alternatively, in chemistry, it is also referred to one mole of substance, in which case it is called the \"molar entropy\" with a unit of J\u22c5mol\u22121\u22c5K\u22121.\nThus, when one mole of substance at about is warmed by its surroundings to , the sum of the incremental values of \"q\"rev/\"T\" constitute each element's or compound's standard molar entropy, an indicator of the amount of energy stored by a substance at . Entropy change also measures the mixing of substances as a summation of their relative quantities in the final mixture.\nEntropy is equally essential in predicting the extent and direction of complex chemical reactions. For such applications, \u0394\"S\" must be incorporated in an expression that includes both the system and its surroundings, \u0394\"S\"universe = \u0394\"S\"surroundings + \u0394\"S\" system. This expression becomes, via some steps, the Gibbs free energy equation for reactants and products in the system: \u0394\"G\" [the Gibbs free energy change of the system] = \u0394\"H\" [the enthalpy change] \u2212 \"T\" \u0394\"S\" [the entropy change].\nWorld's technological capacity to store and communicate entropic information.\nA 2011 study in Science (journal) estimated the world's technological capacity to store and communicate optimally compressed information normalized on the most effective compression algorithms available in the year 2007, therefore estimating the entropy of the technologically available sources. The author's estimate that human kind's technological capacity to store information grew from 2.6 (entropically compressed) exabytes in 1986 to 295 (entropically compressed) exabytes in 2007. The world's technological capacity to receive information through one-way broadcast networks was 432 exabytes of (entropically compressed) information in 1986, to 1.9 zettabytes in 2007. The world's effective capacity to exchange information through two-way telecommunication networks was 281 petabytes of (entropically compressed) information in 1986, to 65 (entropically compressed) exabytes in 2007.\nEntropy balance equation for open systems.\nIn chemical engineering, the principles of thermodynamics are commonly applied to \"open systems\", i.e. those in which heat, work, and mass flow across the system boundary. Flows of both heat (formula_24) and work, i.e. formula_25 (shaft work) and \"P\"(\"dV\"/\"dt\") (pressure-volume work), across the system boundaries, in general cause changes in the entropy of the system. Transfer as heat entails entropy transfer formula_26 where \"T\" is the absolute thermodynamic temperature of the system at the point of the heat flow. If there are mass flows across the system boundaries, they also influence the total entropy of the system. This account, in terms of heat and work, is valid only for cases in which the work and heat transfers are by paths physically distinct from the paths of entry and exit of matter from the system.\nTo derive a generalized entropy balanced equation, we start with the general balance equation for the change in any extensive quantity \u0398 in a thermodynamic system, a quantity that may be either conserved, such as energy, or non-conserved, such as entropy. The basic generic balance expression states that d\u0398/dt, i.e. the rate of change of \u0398 in the system, equals the rate at which \u0398 enters the system at the boundaries, minus the rate at which \u0398 leaves the system across the system boundaries, plus the rate at which \u0398 is generated within the system. For an open thermodynamic system in which heat and work are transferred by paths separate from the paths for transfer of matter, using this generic balance equation, with respect to the rate of change with time \"t\" of the extensive quantity entropy \"S\", the entropy balance equation is:\nwhere\nIf there are multiple heat flows, the term formula_32 is replaced by formula_33 where formula_34 is the heat flow and formula_35 is the temperature at the \"j\"th heat flow port into the system.\nEntropy change formulas for simple processes.\nFor certain simple transformations in systems of constant composition, the entropy changes are given by simple formulas.\nIsothermal expansion or compression of an ideal gas.\nFor the expansion (or compression) of an ideal gas from an initial volume formula_36 and pressure formula_37 to a final volume formula_38 and pressure formula_39 at any constant temperature, the change in entropy is given by:\nHere formula_41 is the number of moles of gas and formula_42 is the ideal gas constant. These equations also apply for expansion into a finite vacuum or a throttling process, where the temperature, internal energy and enthalpy for an ideal gas remain constant.\nCooling and heating.\nFor heating or cooling of any system (gas, liquid or solid) at constant pressure from an initial temperature formula_43 to a final temperature formula_44, the entropy change is\nprovided that the constant-pressure molar heat capacity (or specific heat) \"C\"\"P\" is constant and that no phase transition occurs in this temperature interval.\nSimilarly at constant volume, the entropy change is\nwhere the constant-volume molar heat capacity \"C\"v is constant and there is no phase change.\nAt low temperatures near absolute zero, heat capacities of solids quickly drop off to near zero, so the assumption of constant heat capacity does not apply.\nSince entropy is a state function, the entropy change of any process in which temperature and volume both vary is the same as for a path divided into two steps \u2013 heating at constant volume and expansion at constant temperature. For an ideal gas, the total entropy change is\nSimilarly if the temperature and pressure of an ideal gas both vary,\nPhase transitions.\nReversible phase transitions occur at constant temperature and pressure. The reversible heat is the enthalpy change for the transition, and the entropy change is the enthalpy change divided by the thermodynamic temperature. For fusion (melting) of a solid to a liquid at the melting point \"T\"m, the entropy of fusion is\nSimilarly, for vaporization of a liquid to a gas at the boiling point \"T\"b, the entropy of vaporization is\nApproaches to understanding entropy.\nAs a fundamental aspect of thermodynamics and physics, several different approaches to entropy beyond that of Clausius and Boltzmann are valid.\nStandard textbook definitions.\nThe following is a list of additional definitions of entropy from a collection of textbooks:\nIn Boltzmann's definition, entropy is a measure of the number of possible microscopic states (or microstates) of a system in thermodynamic equilibrium. Consistent with the Boltzmann definition, the second law of thermodynamics needs to be re-worded as such that entropy increases over time, though the underlying principle remains the same.\nOrder and disorder.\nEntropy is often loosely associated with the amount of order or disorder, or of chaos, in a thermodynamic system. The traditional qualitative description of entropy is that it refers to changes in the status quo of the system and is a measure of \"molecular disorder\" and the amount of wasted energy in a dynamical energy transformation from one state or form to another. In this direction, several recent authors have derived exact entropy formulas to account for and measure disorder and order in atomic and molecular assemblies. One of the simpler entropy order/disorder formulas is that derived in 1984 by thermodynamic physicist Peter Landsberg, based on a combination of thermodynamics and information theory arguments. He argues that when constraints operate on a system, such that it is prevented from entering one or more of its possible or permitted states, as contrasted with its forbidden states, the measure of the total amount of \"disorder\" in the system is given by:\nSimilarly, the total amount of \"order\" in the system is given by:\nIn which \"C\"D is the \"disorder\" capacity of the system, which is the entropy of the parts contained in the permitted ensemble, \"C\"I is the \"information\" capacity of the system, an expression similar to Shannon's channel capacity, and \"C\"O is the \"order\" capacity of the system.\nEnergy dispersal.\nThe concept of entropy can be described qualitatively as a measure of energy dispersal at a specific temperature. Similar terms have been in use from early in the history of classical thermodynamics, and with the development of statistical thermodynamics and quantum theory, entropy changes have been described in terms of the mixing or \"spreading\" of the total energy of each constituent of a system over its particular quantized energy levels.\nAmbiguities in the terms \"disorder\" and \"chaos\", which usually have meanings directly opposed to equilibrium, contribute to widespread confusion and hamper comprehension of entropy for most students. As the second law of thermodynamics shows, in an isolated system internal portions at different temperatures tend to adjust to a single uniform temperature and thus produce equilibrium. A recently developed educational approach avoids ambiguous terms and describes such spreading out of energy as dispersal, which leads to loss of the differentials required for work even though the total energy remains constant in accordance with the first law of thermodynamics (compare discussion in next section). Physical chemist Peter Atkins, in his textbook \"Physical Chemistry\", introduces entropy with the statement that \"spontaneous changes are always accompanied by a dispersal of energy\".\nRelating entropy to energy \"usefulness\".\nFollowing on from the above, it is possible (in a thermal context) to regard lower entropy as an indicator or measure of the \"effectiveness\" or \"usefulness\" of a particular quantity of energy. This is because energy supplied at a higher temperature (i.e. with low entropy) tends to be more useful than the same amount of energy available at a lower temperature. Mixing a hot parcel of a fluid with a cold one produces a parcel of intermediate temperature, in which the overall increase in entropy represents a \"loss\" that can never be replaced.\nThus, the fact that the entropy of the universe is steadily increasing, means that its total energy is becoming less useful: eventually, this leads to the \"heat death of the Universe.\"\nEntropy and adiabatic accessibility.\nA definition of entropy based entirely on the relation of adiabatic accessibility between equilibrium states was given by E.H.Lieb and J. Yngvason in 1999. This approach has several predecessors, including the pioneering work of Constantin Carath\u00e9odory from 1909 and the monograph by R. Giles. In the setting of Lieb and Yngvason one starts by picking, for a unit amount of the substance under consideration, two reference states formula_53 and formula_54 such that the latter is adiabatically accessible from the former but not vice versa. Defining the entropies of the reference states to be 0 and 1 respectively the entropy of a state formula_55 is defined as the largest number formula_56 such that formula_55 is adiabatically accessible from a composite state consisting of an amount formula_56 in the state formula_54 and a complementary amount, formula_60, in the state formula_53. A simple but important result within this setting is that entropy is uniquely determined, apart from a choice of unit and an additive constant for each chemical element, by the following properties: It is monotonic with respect to the relation of adiabatic accessibility, additive on composite systems, and extensive under scaling.\nEntropy in quantum mechanics.\nIn quantum statistical mechanics, the concept of entropy was developed by John von Neumann and is generally referred to as \"von Neumann entropy\",\nwhere \"\u03c1\" is the density matrix and Tr is the trace operator.\nThis upholds the correspondence principle, because in the classical limit, when the phases between the basis states used for the classical probabilities are purely random, this expression is equivalent to the familiar classical definition of entropy,\ni.e. in such a basis the density matrix is diagonal.\nVon Neumann established a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics with his work \"Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik\". He provided in this work a theory of measurement, where the usual notion of wave function collapse is described as an irreversible process (the so-called von Neumann or projective measurement). Using this concept, in conjunction with the density matrix he extended the classical concept of entropy into the quantum domain.\nInformation theory.\nWhen viewed in terms of information theory, the entropy state function is the amount of information in the system, that is needed to fully specify the microstate of the system. Entropy is the measure of the amount of missing information before reception. Often called \"Shannon entropy\", it was originally devised by Claude Shannon in 1948 to study the size of information of a transmitted message. The definition of information entropy is expressed in terms of a discrete set of probabilities \"pi\" so that\nIn the case of transmitted messages, these probabilities were the probabilities that a particular message was actually transmitted, and the entropy of the message system was a measure of the average size of information of a message. For the case of equal probabilities (i.e. each message is equally probable), the Shannon entropy (in bits) is just the number of binary questions needed to determine the content of the message.\nMost researchers consider information entropy and thermodynamic entropy directly linked to the same concept, while others argue that they are distinct. Both expressions are mathematically similar. If \"W\" is the number of microstates that can yield a given macrostate, and each microstate has the same \"a priori\" probability, then that probability is . The Shannon entropy (in nats) is:\nwhich is the Boltzmann entropy formula, where \"k\" is Boltzmann's constant, which may be interpreted as the thermodynamic entropy per nat. Some authors argue for dropping the word entropy for the \"H\" function of information theory and using Shannon's other term, \"uncertainty\", instead.\nMeasurement.\nThe entropy of a substance can be measured, although in an indirect way. The measurement uses the definition of temperature in terms of entropy, while limiting energy exchange to heat (formula_67).\nThe resulting relation describes how entropy changes formula_69 when a small amount of energy formula_70 is introduced into the system at a certain temperature\u00a0formula_44.\nThe process of measurement goes as follows. First, a sample of the substance is cooled as close to absolute zero as possible. At such temperatures, the entropy approaches zerodue to the definition of temperature. Then, small amounts of heat are introduced into the sample and the change in temperature is recorded, until the temperature reaches a desired value (usually 25\u00a0\u00b0C). The obtained data allows the user to integrate the equation above, yielding the absolute value of entropy of the substance at the final temperature. This value of entropy is called calorimetric entropy.\nInterdisciplinary applications.\nAlthough the concept of entropy was originally a thermodynamic concept, it has been adapted in other fields of study, including information theory, psychodynamics, thermoeconomics/ecological economics, and evolution.\nFor instance, an entropic argument has been proposed for explaining the preference of cave spiders in choosing a suitable area for laying their eggs. With this expansion of the fields/systems to which the second law of thermodynamics applies, the meaning of the word \"entropy\" has also expanded and is based on the driving energy for that system. The concept divides systems into three categories, natural, hybrid and man-made, based on the amount of control that humans have in slowing the relentless march of entropy and the time-scale of each category to reach maximum entropy.\nArrow of time.\nEntropy is the only quantity in the physical sciences that seems to imply a particular direction of progress, sometimes called an arrow of time. As time progresses, the second law of thermodynamics states that the entropy of an isolated system never decreases in large systems over significant periods of time. Hence, from this perspective, entropy measurement is thought of as a clock in these conditions.\nEntropy of DNA sequences.\nEntropy has been proven useful in the analysis of DNA sequences. Many entropy-based measures have been shown to distinguish between different structural regions of the genome, differentiate between coding and non-coding regions of DNA and can also be applied for the recreation of evolutionary trees by determining the evolutionary distance between different species.\nCosmology.\nAssuming that a finite universe is an isolated system, the second law of thermodynamics states that its total entropy is continually increasing. It has been speculated, since the 19th century, that the universe is fated to a heat death in which all the energy ends up as a homogeneous distribution of thermal energy so that no more work can be extracted from any source.\nIf the universe can be considered to have generally increasing entropy, then \u2013 as Roger Penrose has pointed out \u2013 gravity plays an important role in the increase because gravity causes dispersed matter to accumulate into stars, which collapse eventually into black holes. The entropy of a black hole is proportional to the surface area of the black hole's event horizon. Jacob Bekenstein and Stephen Hawking have shown that black holes have the maximum possible entropy of any object of equal size. This makes them likely end points of all entropy-increasing processes, if they are totally effective matter and energy traps. However, the escape of energy from black holes might be possible due to quantum activity (see Hawking radiation).\nThe role of entropy in cosmology remains a controversial subject since the time of Ludwig Boltzmann. Recent work has cast some doubt on the heat death hypothesis and the applicability of any simple thermodynamic model to the universe in general. Although entropy does increase in the model of an expanding universe, the maximum possible entropy rises much more rapidly, moving the universe further from the heat death with time, not closer. This results in an \"entropy gap\" pushing the system further away from the posited heat death equilibrium. Other complicating factors, such as the energy density of the vacuum and macroscopic quantum effects, are difficult to reconcile with thermodynamical models, making any predictions of large-scale thermodynamics extremely difficult.\nCurrent theories suggest the entropy gap to have been originally opened up by the early rapid exponential expansion of the universe.\nEconomics.\nRomanian American economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, a progenitor in economics and a paradigm founder of ecological economics, made extensive use of the entropy concept in his magnum opus on \"The Entropy Law and the Economic Process\". Due to Georgescu-Roegen's work, the laws of thermodynamics now form an integral part of the ecological economics school. Although his work was blemished somewhat by mistakes, a full chapter on the economics of Georgescu-Roegen has approvingly been included in one elementary physics textbook on the historical development of thermodynamics.\nIn economics, Georgescu-Roegen's work has generated the term 'entropy pessimism'. Since the 1990s, leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist Herman Daly \u2013 a student of Georgescu-Roegen \u2013 has been the economics profession's most influential proponent of the entropy pessimism position.\nHermeneutics.\nIn Hermeneutics, Arianna B\u00e9atrice Fabbricatore has used the term entropy relying on the works of Umberto Eco, to identify and assess the loss of meaning between the verbal description of dance and the choreotext (the moving silk engaged by the dancer when he puts into action the choreographic writing) generated by inter-semiotic translation operations.\nThis use is linked to the notions of logotext and choreotext. In the transition from logotext to choreotext it is possible to identify two typologies of entropy: the first, called \"natural\", is related to the uniqueness of the performative act and its ephemeral character. The second is caused by \"voids\" more or less important in the logotext (\"i.e.\" the verbal text that reflects the action danced)."}

Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a reliable source of technique or skill whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by peers or the public in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of credentials, training, education, profession, publication or experience, to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially (and legally) rely upon the individual's opinion on that topic. Historically, an expert was referred to as a sage. The individual was usually a profound thinker distinguished for wisdom and sound judgment.\nIn specific fields, the definition of expert is well established by consensus and therefore it is not always necessary for individuals to have a professional or academic qualification for them to be accepted as an expert. In this respect, a shepherd with 50 years of experience tending flocks would be widely recognized as having complete expertise in the use and training of sheep dogs and the care of sheep. Another example from computer science is that an expert system may be taught by a human and thereafter considered an expert, often outperforming human beings at particular tasks. In law, an expert witness must be recognized by argument and authority.\nResearch in this area attempts to understand the relation between expert knowledge, skills and personal characteristics and exceptional performance. Some researchers have investigated the cognitive structures and processes of experts. The fundamental aim of this research is to describe what it is that experts know and how they use their knowledge to achieve performance that most people assume requires extreme or extraordinary ability. Studies have investigated the factors that enable experts to be fast and accurate.\nExpertise.\nExpertise characteristics, skills and knowledge of a person (that is, expert) or of a system, which distinguish experts from novices and less experienced people. In many domains there are objective measures of performance capable of distinguishing experts from novices: expert chess players will almost always win games against recreational chess players; expert medical specialists are more likely to diagnose a disease correctly; etc.\nThe word expertise is used to refer also to Expert Determination, where an expert is invited to decide a disputed issue. The decision may be binding or advisory, according to the agreement between the parties in dispute.\nAcademic views.\nThere are two academic approaches to the understanding and study of expertise. The first understands expertise as an emergent property of communities of practice. In this view expertise is socially constructed; tools for thinking and scripts for action are jointly constructed within social groups enabling that group jointly to define and acquire expertise in some domain.\nIn the second view, expertise is a characteristic of individuals and is a consequence of the human capacity for extensive adaptation to physical and social environments. Many accounts of the development of expertise emphasize that it comes about through long periods of deliberate practice. In many domains of expertise estimates of 10 years' experience deliberate practice are common. Recent research on expertise emphasizes the nurture side of the nature and nurture argument. Some factors not fitting the nature-nurture dichotomy are biological but not genetic, such as starting age, handedness, and season of birth.\nIn the field of education there is a potential \"expert blind spot\" (see also Dunning\u2013Kruger effect) in newly practicing educators who are experts in their content area. This is based on the \"expert blind spot hypothesis\" researched by Mitchell Nathan and Andrew Petrosino. Newly practicing educators with advanced subject-area expertise of an educational content area tend to use the formalities and analysis methods of their particular area of expertise as a major guiding factor of student instruction and knowledge development, rather than being guided by student learning and developmental needs that are prevalent among novice learners.\nThe blind spot metaphor refers to the physiological blind spot in human vision in which perceptions of surroundings and circumstances are strongly impacted by their expectations. Beginning practicing educators tend to overlook the importance of novice levels of prior knowledge and other factors involved in adjusting and adapting pedagogy for learner understanding. This expert blind spot is in part due to an assumption that novices\u2019 cognitive schemata are less elaborate, interconnected, and accessible than experts\u2019 and that their pedagogical reasoning skills are less well developed. Essential knowledge of subject matter for practicing educators consists of overlapping knowledge domains: subject matter knowledge and pedagogical content matter. Pedagogical content matter consists of an understanding of how to represent certain concepts in ways appropriate to the learner contexts, including abilities and interests. The expert blind spot is a pedagogical phenomenon that is typically overcome through educators\u2019 experience with instructing learners over time.\nHistorical views.\nIn line with the socially constructed view of expertise, expertise can also be understood as a form of power; that is, experts have the ability to influence others as a result of their defined social status. By a similar token, a fear of experts can arise from fear of an intellectual elite's power. In earlier periods of history, simply being able to read made one part of an intellectual elite. The introduction of the printing press in Europe during the fifteenth century and the diffusion of printed matter contributed to higher literacy rates and wider access to the once-rarefied knowledge of academia. The subsequent spread of education and learning changed society, and initiated an era of widespread education whose elite would now instead be those who produced the written content itself for consumption, in education and all other spheres.\nPlato's \"Noble Lie\", concerns expertise. Plato did not believe most people were clever enough to look after their own and society's best interest, so the few clever people of the world needed to lead the rest of the flock. Therefore, the idea was born that only the elite should know the truth in its complete form and the rulers, Plato said, must tell the people of the city \"the noble lie\" to keep them passive and content, without the risk of upheaval and unrest.\nIn contemporary society, doctors and scientists, for example, are considered to be experts in that they hold a body of dominant knowledge that is, on the whole, inaccessible to the layman. However, this inaccessibility and perhaps even mystery that surrounds expertise does not cause the layman to disregard the opinion of the experts on account of the unknown. Instead, the complete opposite occurs whereby members of the public believe in and highly value the opinion of medical professionals or of scientific discoveries, despite not understanding it.\nRelated research.\nA number of computational models have been developed in cognitive science to explain the development from novice to expert. In particular, Herbert A. Simon and Kevin Gilmartin proposed a model of learning in chess called MAPP (Memory-Aided Pattern Recognizer). Based on simulations, they estimated that about 50,000 chunks (units of memory) are necessary to become an expert, and hence the many years needed to reach this level. More recently, the CHREST model (Chunk Hierarchy and REtrieval STructures) has simulated in detail a number of phenomena in chess expertise (eye movements, performance in a variety of memory tasks, development from novice to expert) and in other domains.\nAn important feature of expert performance seems to be the way in which experts are able to rapidly retrieve complex configurations of information from long-term memory. They recognize situations because they have meaning. It is perhaps this central concern with meaning and how it attaches to situations which provides an important link between the individual and social approaches to the development of expertise. Work on \"Skilled Memory and Expertise\" by Anders Ericsson and James J. Staszewski confronts the paradox of expertise and claims that people not only acquire content knowledge as they practice cognitive skills, they also develop mechanisms that enable them to use a large and familiar knowledge base efficiently.\nWork on expert systems (computer software designed to provide an answer to a problem, or clarify uncertainties where normally one or more human experts would need to be consulted) typically is grounded on the premise that expertise is based on acquired repertoires of rules and frameworks for decision making which can be elicited as the basis for computer supported judgment and decision-making. However, there is increasing evidence that expertise does not work in this fashion. Rather, experts recognize situations based on experience of many prior situations. They are in consequence able to make rapid decisions in complex and dynamic situations.\nIn a critique of the expert systems literature, Dreyfus &amp; Dreyfus suggest:\n If one asks an expert for the rules he or she is using, one will, in effect, force the expert to regress to the level of a beginner and state the rules learned in school. Thus, instead of using rules they no longer remember, as knowledge engineers suppose, the expert is forced to remember rules they no longer use. \u2026 No amount of rules and facts can capture the knowledge an expert has when he or she has stored experience of the actual outcomes of tens of thousands of situations.\nSkilled memory theory.\nThe role of long-term memory in the skilled memory effect was first articulated by Chase and Simon in their classic studies of chess expertise. They asserted that organized patterns of information stored in long-term memory (chunks) mediated experts' rapid encoding and superior retention. Their study revealed that all subjects retrieved about the same number of chunks, but the size of the chunks varied with subjects' prior experience. Experts' chunks contained more individual pieces than those of novices. This research did not investigate how experts find, distinguish, and retrieve the right chunks from the vast number they hold without a lengthy search of long-term memory.\nSkilled memory enables experts to rapidly encode, store, and retrieve information within the domain of their expertise and thereby circumvent the capacity limitations that typically constrain novice performance. For example, it explains experts' ability to recall large amounts of material displayed for only brief study intervals, provided that the material comes from their domain of expertise. When unfamiliar material (not from their domain of expertise) is presented to experts, their recall is no better than that of novices.\nThe first principle of skilled memory, the \"meaningful encoding principle,\" states that experts exploit prior knowledge to durably encode information needed to perform a familiar task successfully. Experts form more elaborate and accessible memory representations than novices. The elaborate semantic memory network creates meaningful memory codes that create multiple potential cues and avenues for retrieval.\nThe second principle, the \"retrieval structure principle\" states that experts develop memory mechanisms called retrieval structures to facilitate the retrieval of information stored in long-term memory. These mechanisms operate in a fashion consistent with the meaningful encoding principle to provide cues that can later be regenerated to retrieve the stored information efficiently without a lengthy search.\nThe third principle, the \"speed up principle\" states that long-term memory encoding and retrieval operations speed up with practice, so that their speed and accuracy approach the speed and accuracy of short-term memory storage and retrieval.\nExamples of skilled memory research described in the Ericsson and Stasewski study include:\nIn problem solving.\nMuch of the research regarding expertise involves the studies of how experts and novices differ in solving problems. Mathematics and physics are common domains for these studies.\nOne of the most cited works in this area examines how experts (PhD students in physics) and novices (undergraduate students that completed one semester of mechanics) categorize and represent physics problems. They found that novices sort problems into categories based upon surface features (e.g., keywords in the problem statement or visual configurations of the objects depicted). Experts, however, categorize problems based upon their deep structures (i.e., the main physics principle used to solve the problem).\nTheir findings also suggest that while the schemas of both novices and experts are activated by the same features of a problem statement, the experts\u2019 schemas contain more procedural knowledge which aid in determining which principle to apply, and novices\u2019 schemas contain mostly declarative knowledge which do not aid in determining methods for solution.\nGermain's scale.\nRelative to a specific field, an expert has:\nMarie-Line Germain developed a psychometric measure of perception of employee expertise called the Generalized Expertise Measure. She defined a behavioral dimension in experts, in addition to the dimensions suggested by Swanson and Holton. Her 16-item scale contains objective expertise items and subjective expertise items. Objective items were named Evidence-Based items. Subjective items (the remaining 11 items from the measure below) were named Self-Enhancement items because of their behavioral component.\nRhetoric.\nScholars in rhetoric have also turned their attention to the concept of the expert. Considered an appeal to ethos or \"the personal character of the speaker\", established expertise allows a speaker to make statements regarding special topics of which the audience may be ignorant. In other words, the expert enjoys the deference of the audience's judgment and can appeal to authority where a non-expert cannot.\nIn The Rhetoric of Expertise, E. Johanna Hartelius defines two basic modes of expertise: autonomous and attributed expertise. While an autonomous expert can \"possess expert knowledge without recognition from other people,\" attributed expertise is \"a performance that may or may not indicate genuine knowledge.\" With these two categories, Hartelius isolates the rhetorical problems faced by experts: just as someone with autonomous expertise may not possess the skill to persuade people to hold their points of view, someone with merely attributed expertise may be persuasive but lack the actual knowledge pertaining to a given subject. The problem faced by audiences follows from the problem facing experts: when faced with competing claims of expertise, what resources do non-experts have to evaluate claims put before them?\nDialogic expertise.\nHartelius and other scholars have also noted the challenges that projects such as Wikipedia pose to how experts have traditionally constructed their authority. In \"Wikipedia and the Emergence of Dialogic Expertise\", she highlights Wikipedia as an example of the \"dialogic expertise\" made possible by collaborative digital spaces. Predicated upon the notion that \"truth emerges from dialogue\", Wikipedia challenges traditional expertise both because anyone can edit it and because no single person, regardless of their credentials, can end a discussion by fiat. In other words, the community, rather than single individuals, direct the course of discussion. The production of knowledge, then, as a process of dialogue and argumentation, becomes an inherently rhetorical activity.\nHartelius calls attention to two competing norm systems of expertise: \u201cnetwork norms of dialogic collaboration\u201d and \u201cdeferential norms of socially sanctioned professionalism\u201d; Wikipedia being evidence of the first. Drawing on a Bakhtinian framework, Hartelius posits that Wikipedia is an example of an epistemic network that is driven by the view that individuals\u2019 ideas clash with one another so as to generate expertise collaboratively. Hartelius compares Wikipedia's methodology of open-ended discussions of topics to that of Bakhtin's theory of speech communication, where genuine dialogue is considered a live event, which is continuously open to new additions and participants. Hartelius acknowledges that knowledge, experience, training, skill, and qualification are important dimensions of expertise but posits that the concept is more complex than sociologists and psychologists suggest. Arguing that expertise is rhetorical, then, Hartelius explains that expertise: \u201c(...) is not simply about one person\u2019s skills being different from another\u2019s. It is also fundamentally contingent on a struggle for ownership and legitimacy.\u201d. Effective communication is an inherent element in expertise in the same style as knowledge is. Rather than leaving each other out, substance and communicative style are complementary. Hartelius further suggests that Wikipedia's dialogic construction of expertise illustrates both the instrumental and the constitutive dimensions of rhetoric; instrumentally as it challenges traditional encyclopedias and constitutively as a function of its knowledge production. Going over the historical development of the encyclopedic project, Hartelius argues that changes in traditional encyclopedias have led to changes in traditional expertise. Wikipedia's use of hyperlinks to connect one topic to another depends on, and develops, electronic interactivity meaning that Wikipedia's way of knowing is dialogic. Dialogic expertise then, emerges from multiple interactions between utterances within the discourse community. The ongoing dialogue between contributors on Wikipedia not only results in the emergence of truth; it also explicates the topics one can be an expert of. As Hartelius explains: \u201cThe very act of presenting information about topics that are not included in traditional encyclopedias is a construction of new expertise.\u201d. While Wikipedia insists that contributors must only publish preexisting knowledge, the dynamics behind dialogic expertise creates new information nonetheless. Knowledge production is created as a function of dialogue. According to Hartelius, dialogic expertise has emerged on Wikipedia not only because of its interactive structure but also because of the site's hortative discourse which is not found in traditional encyclopedias. By Wikipedia's hortative discourse, Hartelius means various encouragements to edit certain topics and instructions on how to do so that appear on the site. One further reason to the emergence of dialogic expertise on Wikipedia is the site's , which function as a techne; explicating Wikipedia's expert methodology.\nNetworked expertise.\nBuilding on Hartelius, Damien Pfister developed the concept of \"networked expertise\". Noting that Wikipedia employs a \"many to many\" rather than a \"one to one\" model of communication, he notes how expertise likewise shifts to become a quality of a group rather than an individual. With the information traditionally associated with individual experts now stored within a text produced by a collective, knowing about something is less important than knowing how to find something. As he puts it, \"With the internet, the historical power of subject matter expertise is eroded: the archival nature of the Web means that what and how to information is readily available.\" The rhetorical authority previously afforded to subject matter expertise, then, is given to those with the procedural knowledge of how to find information called for by a situation.\nContrasts and comparisons.\nAssociated terms.\nAn expert differs from the specialist in that a specialist has to \"be able to solve\" a problem and an expert has to \"know its solution\". The opposite of an expert is generally known as a layperson, while someone who occupies a middle grade of understanding is generally known as a technician and often employed to assist experts. A person may well be an expert in one field and a layperson in many other fields. The concepts of experts and expertise are debated within the field of epistemology under the general heading of expert knowledge. In contrast, the opposite of a specialist would be a generalist or polymath.\nThe term is widely used informally, with people being described as 'experts' in order to bolster the relative value of their opinion, when no objective criteria for their expertise is available. The term crank is likewise used to disparage opinions. Academic elitism arises when experts become convinced that only their opinion is useful, sometimes on matters beyond their personal expertise.\nIn contrast to an expert, a novice (known colloquially as a newbie or 'greenhorn') is any person that is new to any science or field of study or activity or social cause and who is undergoing training in order to meet normal requirements of being regarded a mature and equal participant.\n\"Expert\" is also being mistakenly interchanged with the term \"authority\" in new media. An expert can be an authority if through relationships to people and technology, that expert is allowed to control access to his expertise. However, a person who merely wields authority is not by right an expert. In new media, users are being misled by the term \"authority\". Many sites and search engines such as Google and Technorati use the term \"authority\" to denote the link value and traffic to a particular topic. However, this authority only measures populist information. It in no way assures that the author of that site or blog is an expert.\nDevelopmental characteristics.\nSome characteristics of the development of an expert have been found to include\nUse in literature.\nMark Twain defined an expert as \"an ordinary fellow from another town\". Will Rogers described an expert as \"A man fifty miles from home with a briefcase.\" Danish scientist and Nobel laureate Niels Bohr defined an expert as \"A person that has made every possible mistake within his or her field.\" Malcolm Gladwell describes expertise as a matter of practicing the correct way for a total of around 10,000 hours."}

The billions of dollars in international assistance that came from expats and outside investors saw this increase when there was more political reliability after NATO became involved in Afghanistan's reconstruction. The nation's GDP (PPP) stands these days at about $70 billion with an exchange rate of $20 billion (2017), and the GDP per capita (PPP) is about $2,000. It imports over $6 billion worth of goods but exports about $1 billion worth of legal products, mainly fruits and nuts.\nDespite holding over $1 trillion in proven untapped mineral deposits, Afghanistan remains one of the least developed countries in the world. Its unemployment rate is over 23% and about half of its population lives below the poverty line. Many of the unemployed men join the foreign-funded militant groups or the world of crime, particularly as smugglers. The Afghan government has long sought foreign investment in order to improve Afghanistan's economy.\nEconomic history.\nIn the early modern period under the rule of kings Abdur Rahman Khan (1880\u20131901) and Habibullah Khan (1901\u20131919), a great deal of Afghan commerce was centrally controlled by the Afghan government. The Afghan monarchs were eager to develop the stature of government and the country's military capability, and so attempted to raise money by the imposition of state monopolies on the sale of commodities and high taxes. This slowed the long-term development of Afghanistan during that period. Western technologies and manufacturing methods were slowly introduced during these eras at the command of the Afghan ruler, but in general only according to the logistical requirements of the growing army. An emphasis was placed on the manufacture of weapons and other military material. This process was in the hands of a small number of Western experts invited to Kabul by the Afghan kings. Otherwise, it was not possible for outsiders, particularly westerners, to set up large-scale enterprises in Afghanistan during that period.\nThe first prominent plan to develop Afghanistan's economy in modern times was the Helmand Valley Authority project of 1952, modeled on the Tennessee Valley Authority in the United States, which was expected to be of primary economic importance. Glenn Foster, an American contractor working in Afghanistan in the 1950s, stated this about the Afghan people:\nAfghanistan began facing severe economic hardships during the 1970s when neighboring Pakistan, under Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, began closing the Pakistan-Afghanistan border crossings. This move resulted in Afghanistan increasing political and economic ties with its northern neighbor, the powerful Soviet Union of that time. The 1979 Soviet invasion and ensuing civil war destroyed much of the country's limited infrastructure, and disrupted normal patterns of economic activity. Eventually, Afghanistan went from a traditional economy to a centrally planned economy up until 2002 when it was replaced by a free market economy. Gross domestic product has fallen substantially since the 1980s due to disruption of trade and transport as well as loss of labor and capital. Continuing internal strife severely hampered domestic efforts to rebuild the nation or provide ways for the international community to help.\nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, the Afghan economy grew 20% in the fiscal year ending in March 2004, after expanding 30% in the previous 12 months. The growth was attributed to international aid and to the end of droughts. An estimated $100 billion of aid had entered the nation from 2002 to 2021. A GDP of $4 billion in fiscal year 2003 was recalculated by the IMF to $6.1 billion, after adding proceeds from opium production. Mean graduate pay was $0.56 per man-hour in 2010. The country expects to be self sufficient in wheat, rice, poultry and dairy production by 2026.\nAgriculture and livestock.\nAfghanistan produced in 2018:\nIn addition to smaller productions of other agricultural products.\nAfghanistan currently produces roughly 1.5 million tons of fresh fruits annually, which could be increased significantly. It is known for producing some of the finest fruits, especially pomegranates and grapes as well as sweet melons and mulberries. Other fruits grown in the country are apricots, apples, figs, peaches, cherries and strawberries. The number of farms are steadily increasing. Building and using modern greenhouses is also expanding throughout the country.\nThe northern and western Afghan provinces are known for pistachio cultivation. In recent years, farmers in the southern provinces have also begun cultivating pistachios. Provinces in the east of the country are famous for pine nuts. The northern and central provinces are also famous for almonds and walnuts. The Bamyan Province in central Afghanistan is known for growing superior quality potatoes, which produced 370,000 tons in 2020. Nangarhar is famous for lemons, oranges, olives, peanuts and dates. Cultivation of these products are now spreading to other provinces of the country. The government even planted banana trees in Helmand Province to see if they grow and produce bananas.\nWheat and cereal production is Afghanistan's traditional agricultural mainstay. National wheat production in 2015 was 5 million tons. Afghanistan is nearing self-sufficiency in grain production. It requires an additional 1 million ton of wheat to become self-sufficient, which is predicted to be accomplished in 2020. The overall agricultural production sometimes declines following droughts.\nLivestock in Afghanistan mainly include cattle, sheep, and goats. Poultry farming is widespread. The availability of land suitable for grazing has traditionally made animal husbandry an important part of the economy. There are two main types of animal husbandry: sedentary, practiced by farmers who raise both animals and crops; and nomadic, practiced by animal herders known as Kochis. Natural pastures cover some but are being overgrazed. The northern regions around Mazar-i-Sharif and Maymana were the home range for about six million karakul sheep in the late 1990s. Most flocks move to the highlands in the summer to pastures in the north.\nArable land in Afghanistan was reported to be around 8 million hectares. Wheat production had stood at about 5 million tonnes in 2015, nurseries held 119,000 hectares of land, and grape production is at 615,000 tonnes. Almond production has jumped to 56,000 tons and cotton to 45,000 tonnes. In 2019, it was reported that about 10,000 acres of land in Afghanistan is used to cultivate saffron.\nAccording to the World Bank's report published in April 2019, Afghanistan's economy suffered from the consequences of a severe drought that affected the agriculture production in 2018. While the wheat production declined by 24%, milk production declined by 30%.\nFishing.\nAfghanistan is landlocked with no direct accesss to an ocean but it has a growing number of reservoirs, lakes, ponds, rivers and streams, which make it a suitable climate for fish farming. Historically, fish constituted a smaller part of the Afghan diet because of the unavailability of modern fish farms. Fishing only took place in the lakes and rivers, particularly in the Kunar, Amu and Helmand rivers. Consumption of fish meat has increased sharply due to the establishment of many fish farms. There are over 2,600 of them in the country. The largest one is at the Qargha, which supplies fish eggs to the other fish farms. Fish farming has also been launched in the Afghan-India Friendship Dam.\nForestry.\nAccording to a 2010 report, only about 2.1% (or 1,350,000 ha) of Afghanistan is forested. Its timber has been greatly depleted, and since the mid-1980s, only about 3% of the land area has been forested, mainly in the east. Significant stands of trees have been destroyed by the ravages of the war in the late 20th century. Exploitation has been hampered by insecurity and access roads. Moreover, the distribution of the forest is uneven, and most of the remaining woodland is only found in the Kunar, Nuristan and the Paktia regions in the east of the country. Some steps have been taken in recent years in planting trees in the urban areas across Afghanistan. Even the Taliban spiritual leader has recently called for planting more trees.\nThe natural forests in Afghanistan are mainly of two types: dense forests of oak trees, walnut trees, and many other species of nuts that grow in the southeast, and on the northern and northeastern slopes of the Sulaiman ranges; and sparsely distributed short trees and shrubs on all other slopes of the Hindu Kush. The dense forests of the southeast cover only 2.7% of the country. Roundwood production in 2003 was 3,148,000 cubic metres, with 44% used for fuel.\nTrade and industry.\nAfghanistan's geographical location makes the country economically secured. This could play a major role in the future. Even its trade with other countries is steadily increasing with the establishment of more international transportation routes. One of these trade routes is the Lapis Lazuli corridor, which connects Afghanistan with Turkmenistan and ultimately ends somewhere in Europe. Other such trade routes connect Afghanistan with neighboring Iran, Pakistan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The country also has direct trade with India via air corridor. Its rail system is slowly expanding to connect Central Asia with Pakistan and Iran.\nThe Afghanistan\u2013Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA) allows Afghan and Pakistani cargo trucks to transit goods within both nations. This revised US-sponsored APTTA agreement also allows Afghan trucks to transport exports to India via Pakistan up to the Wagah crossing point. There are at least nine main land ports around Afghanistan. They include Abu Nasar Farahi in Farah Province, Aqina in Faryab Province, Hairatan in Balkh Province, Islam Qala in Herat Province, Sher Khan Bandar in Kunduz Province, Torghundi in Herat Province, Torkham in Nangarhar Province, Spin Boldak in Kandahar Province, and Zaranj in Nimruz Province. Some of these ports are mismanaged due to political corruption, which sometimes result in huge financial losses to the traders and transport companies.\nAfghanistan has legal access to two major seaports in Pakistan, the Gwadar Port in Balochistan and the Port Qasim in Sindh. Afghanistan also has legal access to two major seaports in Iran, which include the Bandar Abbas and the Chabahar Port in the south of the country.\nTrade in goods smuggled into Pakistan once constituted a major source of revenue for Afghanistan. Many of the goods that were smuggled into Pakistan have originally entered Afghanistan from Pakistan, where they fell under the 1965 APTTA. This permitted goods bound for Afghanistan to transit through Pakistani seaports free of duty. Once in Afghanistan, the goods were often immediately smuggled back into Pakistan over the porous border that the two countries share, often with the help of corrupt officials. Additionally, items declared as Afghanistan-bound were often prematurely offloaded from trucks and smuggled into Pakistani markets without paying requisite duty fees. This resulted in the creation of a thriving black market, with much of the illegal trading occurring openly, as was common in Peshawar's bustling Karkhano Market, which was widely regarded as a smuggler's bazaar.\nAfghanistan is endowed with a wealth of natural resources, including extensive deposits of natural gas, petroleum, coal, marble, gold, copper, chromite, talc, barites, sulfur, lead, zinc, iron ore, salt, precious and semi-precious stones, and many rare earth elements. In 2006, a U.S. Geological Survey estimated that Afghanistan has as much as of natural gas, of oil and condensate reserves. According to a 2007 assessment, Afghanistan has significant amounts of undiscovered non-fuel mineral resources. Geologists also found indications of abundant deposits of colored stones and gemstones, including emerald, ruby, sapphire, garnet, lapis, kunzite, spinel, tourmaline and peridot.\nIn 2010, U.S. Pentagon officials along with American geologists have revealed the discovery of nearly $1 trillion in untapped mineral deposits in Afghanistan. A memo from the Pentagon stated that Afghanistan could become the \"Saudi Arabia of lithium\". Some believe that the untapped minerals are worth up to $3 trillion. The Khanashin carbonatites in the Helmand Province of the country have an estimated 1 million metric tonnes of rare earth elements.\nAfghanistan signed a copper deal with China (Metallurgical Corp. of China Ltd.) in 2008, which is to a large-scale project that involves the investment of $2.8 billion by China and an annual income of about $400 million to the Afghan government. The country's Ainak copper mine, located in Logar Province, is one of the biggest in the world. It is estimated to hold at least 11 million tonnes or US$33 billion worth of copper.\nOn October 5, 2018 in Washington, D.C., Afghan officials signed a 30 year contract with investment group Centar and its operating company, Afghan Gold and Minerals Co., to explore and develop a copper mining operation in Balkhab District in Sar-e Pol Province and to explore and develop a gold mining operation in Badakhshan Province. The copper contract involved a $56 million investment and the gold contract a $22 million investment.\nThe country's other recently announced treasure is the Hajigak iron ore mine, located 130 miles west of Kabul and is believed to hold an estimated 1.8 billion to 2 billion metric tons of the mineral used to make steel. AFISCO, an Indian consortium of seven companies, led by the Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL), and Canada's Kilo Goldmines Ltd are expected to jointly invest $14.6 billion in developing the Hajigak iron mine. The country has several coal mines but need to be modernized.\nAfghanistan's important resource in the past has been natural gas, which was first tapped in 1967. During the 1980s, gas sales accounted for $300 million a year in export revenues (56% of the total). About 90% of these exports went to the Soviet Union to pay for imports and debts. However, during the withdrawal of Soviet troops in 1989, the natural gas fields were capped to prevent sabotage by criminals. Gas production has dropped from a high of 8.2 million cubic metres per day in the 1980s to a low of about 600,000 cubic meters in 2001. Production of natural gas was restored during the Karzai administration in 2010.\nIn December 2011, Afghanistan signed an oil exploration contract with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) for the development of three oil fields along the Amu Darya river. CNPC began Afghan oil production in late October 2012, with extracting 1.5 million barrels of oil annually.\nEconomic development and recovery.\nAfghanistan embarked on a modest economic development program in the 1930s. The government founded banks; introduced paper money; established a university; expanded primary, secondary, and technical schools; and sent students abroad for education. In 1952 it created the Helmand Valley Authority to manage the economic development of the Helmand and Arghandab valleys through irrigation and land development, a scheme which remains one of the country's most important capital resources.\nIn 1956, the government promulgated the first in a long series of ambitious development plans. By the late 1970s, these had achieved only mixed results due to flaws in the planning process as well as inadequate funding and a shortage of the skilled managers and technicians needed for implementation.\nDa Afghanistan Bank serves as the central bank of the nation. The \"Afghani\" (AFN) is the national currency, which has an exchange rate of nearly 70 Afghanis to 1 US dollar. There are over 16 different banks operating in the country, including Afghanistan International Bank, Kabul Bank, Azizi Bank, Pashtany Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, and First Micro Finance Bank. Cash is still widely used for most transactions. A new law on private investment provides three to seven-year tax holidays to eligible companies and a four-year exemption from exports tariffs and duties. According to a UN report in 2007, Afghanistan has received over $3.3 billion from its expatriate community in 2006. UN officials familiar with the issue said remittances to Afghanistan could have been more if the banking regulations are more convenient. Additionally, improvements to the business-enabling environment have resulted in more than $1.5 billion in telecom investment and created more than 100,000 jobs since 2003.\nAfghanistan is a member of World Trade Organization, SAARC, ECO, OIC, and has an observer status in the SCO. It seeks to complete the so-called \"New Silk Road\" trade project, which is aimed to connecting South Asia with Central Asia and the Middle East. This way Afghanistan will be able to collect large fees from trade passing through the country, including from the Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline. Foreign Minister Zalmai Rassoul has stated that the \"goal is to achieve an Afghan economy whose growth is based on trade, private enterprise and investment\". Experts believe that this will revolutionize the economy of the region.\nAs part of an attempt to modernize the city and boost the economy, a number of new high rise buildings are under construction by various developers. Some of the national development projects include the New Kabul City next to the capital, the Aino Mena in Kandahar, and the Ghazi Amanullah Khan City east of Jalalabad. Similar development projects are also found in Herat in the west, Mazar-e-Sharif in the north and in other cities.\nAfghan handwoven rugs are one of the most popular products for exportation. Other products include hand crafted antique replicas as well as leather and furs. Afghanistan is the third largest exporter of cashmere. Afghanistan has no textile industry. The country imports roughly $500 million of textile goods from other countries. Afghanistan also lacks major international companies. This may explain why the country has high unemployment rate. As a competitor of the Coca-Cola Company, the Pepsi-Cola Company is said to be establishing itself in Afghanistan. This not only promotes foreign investment but also makes the country less dependent on imports from neighboring countries and helps provide employment opportunity to many Afghans.\nIn February 2019, it was reported that the World Bank granted $235 million to the government of Afghanistan for the country's development and growth. The acting Minister of Finance Humayon Qayoumi said that out of the total amount granted, $75 million will finance \"the Tackling Afghanistan's Government HRM (Human Resource Management) and Institutional Reforms (TAGHIR) project, which will strengthen the capacity of selected line ministries. The grant also includes 25 million U.S. dollars from IDA (International Development Association) and 50 million U.S. dollars from ARTF (Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund).\"\nGDP growth in Afghanistan dropped to 1.8% in 2018 as compared to 2.9% in 2017, partially because of drought. It then recovered to 2.5% in 2019, and is predicted to rise to 3.0% in 2020.\nTourism.\nTourism in Afghanistan was at its peak in 1977. Many tourists from around the world came to visit Afghanistan, including from as far away as Europe and North America. All of that ended with the start of the April 1978 Saur Revolution. However, it is again gradually increasing despite the insecurity. Each year about 20,000 foreign tourists visit Afghanistan. Tourists should avoid areas where armed criminals operate in the name of Taliban.\nThe country has four international airports, including the Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul; the Maulana Jalaluddin Balkhi International Airport in Mazar-i-Sharif; the Khwaja Abdullah Ansari International Airport in Herat; and the Ahmad Shah Baba International Airport in Kandahar. It also has several smaller airports throughout the country. The city of Kabul has many guest houses and hotels, including the Serena Hotel, the Hotel Inter-Continental Kabul, and the Safi Landmark Hotel. Small number of guest houses and hotels are also available in other cities such Kandahar, Herat, Mazar-i-Sharif, etc.\nThe following are some notable places in Afghanistan that tourists find worth visiting:\nNational accounts.\n\"The majority of the following information is taken from, or adapted from The World Factbook\"\nGDP: purchasing power parity $69.45 billion, with an exchange rate at $20.24 billion (2017 estimate)\nGDP - real growth rate: \nGDP - per capita: purchasing power parity - $2,000 (2016)\nGDP - composition by sector:\nnote: data excludes opium production\nPopulation below poverty line:\nHousehold income or consumption by percentage share:\nInflation rate (consumer prices): 5% (2017)\n&lt;br&gt;\"country comparison to the world:\" 171\nLabor force: 8.478 million (2017) \n&lt;br&gt;\"country comparison to the world:\" 61\nLabor force - by occupation: agriculture 44.3%, industry 18.1%, services 37.6% (2017)\nUnemployment rate: 23.9% (2017)\n&lt;br&gt;\"country comparison to the world:\" 194\nBudget:\nIndustries: small-scale production of textiles, soap, furniture, shoes, fertilizer, apparel, food-products, non-alcoholic beverages, mineral water, cement; handwoven carpets; natural gas, coal, copper\nElectricity - production: 1.211 billion kWh (2016 est.) \n&lt;br&gt;\"country comparison to the world:\" 146\nElectricity - production by source:\nElectricity - consumption: 5.526 billion kWh (2016 est.)\n&lt;br&gt;\"country comparison to the world:\" 119\nElectricity - exports: 0 kWh (2016 est.)\nElectricity - imports: 4.4 billion kWh (2016 est.)\nOil - production: (2012)\n&lt;br&gt;\"country comparison to the world:\" 210\nOil - consumption: (2016)\n&lt;br&gt;\"country comparison to the world:\" 117\nOil - proved reserves: (2006)\nNatural gas - production: 164.2 million m\u00b3 (2017)\nNatural gas - consumption: 164.2 million m\u00b3 (2017)\nNatural gas - proved reserves: 49.55 billion m\u00b3 (2018)\nAgriculture - products: wheat, fruits, nuts, wool, mutton, sheepskins, lambskins, poppies\nExports: $784 million (2017)\n&lt;br&gt;\"country comparison to the world:\" 171\nExports - commodities: fruits and nuts, handwoven carpets, wool, cotton, hides and pelts, precious and semi-precious gems, and medical herbs\nExports - partners: India 56.5%, Pakistan 29.6% (2017)\nImports: $7.616 billion (2017)\nImports - commodities: machinery and other capital goods, food, textiles, petroleum products\nImports - partners: China 21%, Iran 20.5%, Pakistan 11.8%, Kazakhstan 11%, Uzbekistan 6.8%, Malaysia 5.3% (2017)\nDebt - external: $2.84 billion total (2011)\nCurrent account balance: -$743.9 million (2011)\n&lt;br&gt;\"country comparison to the world:\" 132\nCurrency: Afghani (AFN)\nExchange rates: Afghanis (AFN) per US dollar - 68.3 = $1\nFiscal year: 21 December - 20 December\nEnergy in Afghanistan.\nEnergy in Afghanistan is provided by hydropower followed by fossil fuel and solar power. According to Da Afghanistan Breshna Sherkat (DABS), approximately 35% of Afghanistan's population has access to electricity. This covers the major cities in the country. Many rural areas do not have access to 24-hour electricity but this should change after the major CASA-1000 project is completed.\nAfghanistan currently generates over 600 megawatts (MW) of electricity from its several hydroelectric plants as well as using fossil fuel and solar panels. Over 670 MW more is imported from neighboring Iran, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.\nDue to the large influx of expats from neighboring Pakistan and Iran, Afghanistan may require as much as 7,000 MW of electricity in the coming years. The Afghan National Development Strategy has identified alternative energy, such as wind and solar energy, as a high value power source to develop. As a result, a number of solar and wind farms have been established, with more currently under development."}
{"id": "9896", "revid": "36235269", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9896", "title": "Elf", "text": "An elf (plural: elves) is a type of humanoid supernatural being in Germanic mythology and folklore. In medieval Germanic-speaking cultures, elves generally seem to have been thought of as beings with magical powers and supernatural beauty, ambivalent towards everyday people and capable of either helping or hindering them. However, the details of these beliefs have varied considerably over time and space, and have flourished in both pre-Christian and Christian cultures.\nThe word \"elf\" is found throughout the Germanic languages and seems originally to have meant 'white being'. Reconstructing the early concept of an elf depends largely on texts, written by Christians, in Old and Middle English, medieval German, and Old Norse. These associate elves variously with the gods of Norse mythology, with causing illness, with magic, and with beauty and seduction.\nAfter the medieval period, the word \"elf\" tended to become less common throughout the Germanic languages, losing out to alternative native terms like \"Zwerg\" (\"dwarf\") in German and \"huldra\" (\"hidden being\") in Scandinavian languages, and to loan-words like \"fairy\" (borrowed from French into most of the Germanic languages). Still, beliefs in elves persisted in the early modern period, particularly in Scotland and Scandinavia, where elves were thought of as magically powerful people living, usually invisibly, alongside everyday human communities. They continued to be associated with causing illnesses and with sexual threats. For example, a number of early modern ballads in the British Isles and Scandinavia, originating in the medieval period, describe elves attempting to seduce or abduct human characters.\nWith urbanisation and industrialisation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, beliefs in elves declined rapidly (though Iceland has some claim to continued popular belief in elves). However, from the early modern period onwards, elves started to be prominent in the literature and art of educated elites. These literary elves were imagined as small, impish beings, with William Shakespeare's \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" being a key development of this idea. In the eighteenth century, German Romanticist writers were influenced by this notion of the elf, and reimported the English word \"elf\" into the German language.\nFrom this Romanticist elite culture came the elves of popular culture that emerged in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The \"Christmas elves\" of contemporary popular culture are a relatively recent creation, popularized during the late nineteenth-century in the United States. Elves entered the twentieth-century high fantasy genre in the wake of works published by authors such as J.\u00a0R.\u00a0R. Tolkien; these re-popularised the idea of elves as human-sized and humanlike beings. Elves remain a prominent feature of fantasy books and games nowadays.\nRelationship with reality.\nReality and perception.\nFrom a scientific viewpoint, elves are not considered objectively real. However, elves have in many times and places been believed to be real beings. Where enough people have believed in the reality of elves that those beliefs then had real effects in the world, they can be understood as part of people's worldview, and as a social reality: a thing which, like the exchange value of a dollar bill or the sense of pride stirred up by a national flag, is real because of people's beliefs rather than as an objective reality. Accordingly, beliefs about elves and their social functions have varied over time and space.\nEven in the twenty-first century, fantasy stories about elves have been argued both to reflect and to shape their audiences' understanding of the real world, and traditions about Santa Claus and his elves relate to Christmas.\nOver time, people have attempted to demythologise or rationalise beliefs in elves in various ways.\nIntegration into Christian cosmologies.\nBeliefs about elves have their origins before the conversion to Christianity and associated Christianization of northwest Europe. For this reason, belief in elves has, from the Middle Ages through into recent scholarship, often been labelled \"pagan\" and a \"superstition\". However, almost all surviving textual sources about elves were produced by Christians (whether Anglo-Saxon monks, medieval Icelandic poets, early modern ballad-singers, nineteenth-century folklore collectors, or even twentieth-century fantasy authors). Attested beliefs about elves therefore need to be understood as part of Germanic-speakers' Christian culture and not merely a relic of their pre-Christian religion. Accordingly, investigating the relationship between beliefs in elves and Christian cosmology has been a preoccupation of scholarship about elves both in early times and in modern research.\nHistorically, people have taken three main approaches to integrating elves into Christian cosmology, all of which are found widely across time and space:\nDemythologising elves as indigenous peoples.\nSome nineteenth- and twentieth-century scholars attempted to rationalise beliefs in elves as folk-memories of lost indigenous peoples. Since belief in supernatural beings is so ubiquitous in human cultures, however, scholars no longer believe such explanations are valid. Research has shown, however, that stories about elves have often been used as a way for people to think metaphorically about real-life ethnic others.\nDemythologising elves as people with illness or disability.\nScholars have at times also tried to explain beliefs in elves as being inspired by people suffering certain kinds of illnesses (such as Williams syndrome). Elves were certainly often seen as a cause of illness, and indeed the English word \"oaf\" seems to have originated as a form of \"elf\": the word \"elf\" came to mean 'changeling left by an elf' and then, because changelings were noted for their failure to thrive, to its modern sense 'a fool, a stupid person; a large, clumsy man or boy'. However, it again seems unlikely that the origin of beliefs in elves itself is to be explained by people's encounters with objectively real people affected by disease.\nEtymology.\nThe English word \"elf\" is from the Old English word most often attested as (whose plural would have been *). Although this word took a variety of forms in different Old English dialects, these converged on the form \"elf\" during the Middle English period. During the Old English period, separate forms were used for female elves (such as , putatively from Common Germanic *), but during the Middle English period the word \"elf\" came routinely to include female beings.\nThe Old English forms are cognates \u2013 linguistic siblings stemming from a common origin \u2013 with medieval Germanic terms such as Old Norse ('nightmare, elf'; plural ), Old High German ('evil spirit'; pl. , ; feminine ), Burgundian *\"alfs\" ('elf'), and Middle Low German \"\" ('evil spirit'). These words must come from Common Germanic, the ancestor-language of the attested Germanic languages; the Common Germanic forms are reconstructed as * and *.\nGermanic \"*\u0251l\u03b2i-z~*\u0251l\u03b2\u0251-z\" is generally agreed to be a cognate with Latin \"albus\" ('(matt) white'); Old Irish \"ailbh\u00edn\" ('flock'); Greek \"alpho\u00fas\" ('white'; \u1f00\u03bb\u03c6\u03bf\u03cd\u03c2); Albanian \"elb\" ('barley'); and Germanic words for 'swan' such as Modern Icelandic \"\u00e1lpt\". These all come from an Indo-European root \"*h\u2082elb\u02b0-\", and seem to be connected by the idea of whiteness. The Germanic word presumably originally meant \"white one\", perhaps as a euphemism. Jakob Grimm thought whiteness implied positive moral connotations, and, noting Snorri Sturluson's \"lj\u00f3s\u00e1lfar\", suggested that elves were divinities of light. This is not necessarily the case, however. For example, because the cognates suggest matt white rather than shining white, and because in medieval Scandinavian texts whiteness is associated with beauty, Alaric Hall has suggested that elves may have been called \"the white people\" because whiteness was associated with (specifically feminine) beauty. Some scholars have argued that the names Albion and Alps may also be related.\nA completely different etymology, making \"elf\" a cognate with the \"Rbhus\", semi-divine craftsmen in Indian mythology, was also suggested by Kuhn, in 1855. In this case, *\"\u0251l\u03b2i-z\" connotes the meaning, \"skillful, inventive, clever\", and is a cognate with the Latin \"labor\", in the sense of \"creative work\". While often mentioned, this etymology is not widely accepted.\nIn proper names.\nThroughout the medieval Germanic languages, \"elf\" was one of the nouns used in personal names, almost invariably as a first element. These names may have been influenced by Celtic names beginning in \"Albio-\" such as \"Albiorix\".\nPersonal names provide the only evidence for \"elf\" in Gothic, which must have had the word * (plural *). The most famous name of this kind is \"Alboin\". Old English names in \"elf\"- include the cognate of \"Alboin\" \u00c6lfwine (literally \"elf-friend\", m.), \u00c6lfric (\"elf-powerful\", m.), \u00c6lfweard (\"elf-guardian\", m.), and \u00c6lfwaru (\"elf-care\", f.). A widespread survivor of these in modern English is Alfred (Old English \"\u00c6lfr\u0113d\", \"elf-advice\"). Also surviving are the English surname Elgar (\"\u00c6lfgar\", \"elf-spear\") and the name of St Alphege (\"\u00c6lfh\u0113ah\", \"elf-tall\"). German examples are \"Alberich\", \"Alphart\" and \"Alphere\" (father of Walter of Aquitaine) and Icelandic examples include \"\u00c1lfhildur\". These names suggest that elves were positively regarded in early Germanic culture. Of the many words for supernatural beings in Germanic languages, the only ones regularly used in personal names are \"elf\" and words denoting pagan gods, suggesting that elves were considered similar to gods.\nIn later Old Icelandic, (\"elf\") and the personal name which in Common Germanic had been * both coincidentally became .\nElves appear in some place names, though it is difficult to be sure how many as a variety of other words, including personal names, can appear similar to \"elf\". The clearest English example is \"Elveden\" (\"elves' hill\", Suffolk); other examples may be \"Eldon Hill\" (\"Elves' hill\", Derbyshire); and \"Alden Valley\" (\"elves' valley\", Lancashire). These seem to associate elves fairly consistently with woods and valleys.\nIn medieval texts and post-medieval folk belief.\nMedieval English-language sources.\nAs causes of illnesses.\nThe earliest surviving manuscripts mentioning elves in any Germanic language are from Anglo-Saxon England. Medieval English evidence has, therefore, attracted quite extensive research and debate. In Old English, elves are most often mentioned in medical texts which attest to the belief that elves might afflict humans and livestock with illnesses: apparently mostly sharp, internal pains and mental disorders. The most famous of the medical texts is the metrical charm \"Wi\u00f0 f\u00e6rstice\" (\"against a stabbing pain\"), from the tenth-century compilation \"Lacnunga\", but most of the attestations are in the tenth-century \"Bald's Leechbook\" and \"Leechbook III\". This tradition continues into later English-language traditions too: elves continue to appear in Middle English medical texts.\nBeliefs in elves causing illnesses remained prominent in early modern Scotland, where elves were viewed as being supernaturally powerful people who lived invisibly alongside everyday rural people. Thus, elves were often mentioned in the early modern Scottish witchcraft trials: many witnesses in the trials believed themselves to have been given healing powers or to know of people or animals made sick by elves. Throughout these sources, elves are sometimes associated with the succubus-like supernatural being called the \"mare\".\nWhile they may have been thought to cause diseases with magical weapons, elves are more clearly associated in Old English with a kind of magic denoted by Old English \"s\u012bden\" and \"s\u012bdsa\", a cognate with the Old Norse \"sei\u00f0r\", and also paralleled in the Old Irish \"Serglige Con Culainn\". By the fourteenth century they were also associated with the arcane practice of alchemy.\n\"Elf-shot\".\nIn one or two Old English medical texts, elves might be envisaged as inflicting illnesses with projectiles. In the twentieth century, scholars often labelled the illnesses elves caused as \"elf-shot\", but work from the 1990s onwards showed that the medieval evidence for elves' being thought to cause illnesses in this way is slender; debate about its significance is ongoing.\nThe noun \"elf-shot\" is actually first attested in a Scots poem, \"Rowlis Cursing\", from around 1500, where \"elf schot\" is listed among a range of curses to be inflicted on some chicken thieves. The term may not always have denoted an actual projectile: \"shot\" could mean \"a sharp pain\" as well as \"projectile\". But in early modern Scotland \"elf-schot\" and other terms like \"elf-arrowhead\" are sometimes used of neolithic arrow-heads, apparently thought to have been made by elves. In a few witchcraft trials people attest that these arrow-heads were used in healing rituals, and occasionally alleged that witches (and perhaps elves) used them to injure people and cattle. Compare with the following excerpt from a 1749\u201350 ode by William Collins:\nSize, appearance, and sexuality.\nBecause of elves' association with illness, in the twentieth century, most scholars imagined that elves in the Anglo-Saxon tradition were small, invisible, demonic beings, causing illnesses with arrows. This was encouraged by the idea that \"elf-shot\" is depicted in the Eadwine Psalter, in an image which became well known in this connection. However, this is now thought to be a misunderstanding: the image proves to be a conventional illustration of God's arrows and of Christian demons. Rather, recent scholarship suggests Anglo-Saxon elves, like elves in Scandinavia or the Irish \"Aos S\u00ed\", were regarded as people.\nLike words for gods and men, the word \"elf\" is used in personal names where words for monsters and demons are not. Just as \"\u00e1lfar\" is associated with \"\u00c6sir\" in Old Norse, the Old English \"Wi\u00f0 f\u00e6rstice\" associates elves with \"\u0113se\"; whatever this word meant by the tenth century, etymologically it denoted pagan gods. In Old English, the plural (attested in \"Beowulf\") is grammatically an ethnonym (a word for an ethnic group), suggesting that elves were seen as people. As well as appearing in medical texts, the Old English word \"\u00e6lf\" and its feminine derivative \"\u00e6lbinne\" were used in glosses to translate Latin words for nymphs. This fits well with the word \"\u00e6lfsc\u0233ne\", which meant \"elf-beautiful\" and is attested describing the seductively beautiful Biblical heroines Sarah and Judith.\nLikewise, in Middle English and early modern Scottish evidence, while still appearing as causes of harm and danger, elves appear clearly as humanlike beings. They became associated with medieval chivalric romance traditions of fairies and particularly with the idea of a Fairy Queen. A propensity to seduce or rape people becomes increasingly prominent in the source material. Around the fifteenth century, evidence starts to appear for the belief that elves might steal human babies and replace them with changelings.\nDecline in the use of the word \"elf\".\nBy the end of the medieval period, \"elf\" was increasingly being supplanted by the French loan-word \"fairy\". An example is Geoffrey Chaucer's satirical tale \"Sir Thopas\", where the title character sets out in a quest for the \"elf-queen\", who dwells in the \"countree of the Faerie\".\nOld Norse texts.\nMythological texts.\nEvidence for elf beliefs in medieval Scandinavia outside Iceland is very sparse, but the Icelandic evidence is uniquely rich. For a long time, views about elves in Old Norse mythology were defined by Snorri Sturluson's \"Prose Edda\", which talks about \"svart\u00e1lfar\", \"d\u00f6kk\u00e1lfar\" and \"lj\u00f3s\u00e1lfar\" (\"black elves\", \"dark elves\", and \"light elves\"). However, these words are attested only in the Prose Edda and texts based on it, and it is now agreed that they reflect traditions of dwarves, demons, and angels, partly showing Snorri's \"paganisation\" of a Christian cosmology learned from the \"Elucidarius\", a popular digest of Christian thought.\nScholars of Old Norse mythology now focus on references to elves in Old Norse poetry, particularly the Elder Edda. The only character explicitly identified as an elf in classical Eddaic poetry, if any, is V\u00f6lundr, the protagonist of \"V\u00f6lundarkvi\u00f0a\". However, elves are frequently mentioned in the alliterating phrase \"\u00c6sir ok \u00c1lfar\" ('\u00c6sir and elves') and its variants. This was clearly a well-established poetic formula, indicating a strong tradition of associating elves with the group of gods known as the \u00c6sir, or even suggesting that the elves and \u00c6sir were one and the same. The pairing is paralleled in the Old English poem \"Wi\u00f0 f\u00e6rstice\" and in the Germanic personal name system; moreover, in Skaldic verse the word \"elf\" is used in the same way as words for gods. Sigvatr \u00de\u00f3r\u00f0arson's skaldic travelogue \"Austrfarav\u00edsur\", composed around 1020, mentions an \"\u00e1lfabl\u00f3t\" ('elves' sacrifice') in Edskogen in what is now southern Sweden. There does not seem to have been any clear-cut distinction between humans and gods; like the \u00c6sir, then, elves were presumably thought of as being humanlike and existing in opposition to the giants. Many commentators have also (or instead) argued for conceptual overlap between elves and dwarves in Old Norse mythology, which may fit with trends in the medieval German evidence.\nThere are hints that the god Freyr was associated with elves. In particular, \"\u00c1lfheimr\" (literally \"elf-world\") is mentioned as being given to Freyr in \"Gr\u00edmnism\u00e1l\". Snorri Sturluson identified Freyr as one of the Vanir. However, the term \"Vanir\" is rare in Eddaic verse, very rare in Skaldic verse, and is not generally thought to appear in other Germanic languages. Given the link between Freyr and the elves, it has therefore long been suspected that \"\u00e1lfar\" and \"Vanir\" are, more or less, different words for the same group of beings. However, this is not uniformly accepted.\nA kenning (poetic metaphor) for the sun, \"\u00e1lfr\u00f6\u00f0ull\" (literally \"elf disc\"), is of uncertain meaning but is to some suggestive of a close link between elves and the sun.\nAlthough the relevant words are of slightly uncertain meaning, it seems fairly clear that V\u00f6lundr is described as one of the elves in \"V\u00f6lundarkvi\u00f0a\". As his most prominent deed in the poem is to rape B\u00f6\u00f0vildr, the poem associates elves with being a sexual threat to maidens. The same idea is present in two post-classical Eddaic poems, which are also influenced by chivalric romance or Breton \"lais\", \"K\u00f6tludraumur\" and \"Gullk\u00e1rslj\u00f3\u00f0\". The idea also occurs in later traditions in Scandinavia and beyond, so it may be an early attestation of a prominent tradition. Elves also appear in a couple of verse spells, including the Bergen rune-charm from among the Bryggen inscriptions.\nOther sources.\nThe appearance of elves in sagas is closely defined by genre. The Sagas of Icelanders, Bishops' sagas, and contemporary sagas, whose portrayal of the supernatural is generally restrained, rarely mention \"\u00e1lfar\", and then only in passing. But although limited, these texts provide some of the best evidence for the presence of elves in everyday beliefs in medieval Scandinavia. They include a fleeting mention of elves seen out riding in 1168 (in \"Sturlunga saga\"); mention of an \"\u00e1lfabl\u00f3t\" (\"elves' sacrifice\") in \"Korm\u00e1ks saga\"; and the existence of the euphemism \"ganga \u00e1lfrek\" ('go to drive away the elves') for \"going to the toilet\" in \"Eyrbyggja saga\".\nThe Kings' sagas include a rather elliptical but widely studied account of an early Swedish king being worshipped after his death and being called \u00d3lafr Geirsta\u00f0a\u00e1lfr ('\u00d3lafr the elf of Geirsta\u00f0ir'), and a demonic elf at the beginning of \"Norna-Gests \u00fe\u00e1ttr\".\nThe legendary sagas tend to focus on elves as legendary ancestors or on heroes' sexual relations with elf-women. Mention of the land of \u00c1lfheimr is found in \"Heimskringla\" while \"\u00deorsteins saga V\u00edkingssonar\" recounts a line of local kings who ruled over \u00c1lfheim, who since they had elven blood were said to be more beautiful than most men. According to \"Hr\u00f3lfs saga kraka\", Hrolfr Kraki's half-sister Skuld was the half-elven child of King Helgi and an elf-woman (\"\u00e1lfkona\"). Skuld was skilled in witchcraft (\"sei\u00f0r\"). Accounts of Skuld in earlier sources, however, do not include this material. The \"\u00dei\u00f0reks saga\" version of the Nibelungen (Niflungar) describes H\u00f6gni as the son of a human queen and an elf, but no such lineage is reported in the Eddas, \"V\u00f6lsunga saga\", or the \"Nibelungenlied\". The relatively few mentions of elves in the chivalric sagas tend even to be whimsical.\nBoth Continental Scandinavia and Iceland have a scattering of mentions of elves in medical texts, sometimes in Latin and sometimes in the form of amulets, where elves are viewed as a possible cause of illness. Most of them have Low German connections.\nMedieval and early modern German texts.\nThe Old High German word \"alp\" is attested only in a small number of glosses. It is defined by the \"Althochdeutsches W\u00f6rterbuch\" as a \"nature-god or nature-demon, equated with the Fauns of Classical mythology... regarded as eerie, ferocious beings... As the mare he messes around with women\". Accordingly, the German word \"Alpdruck\" (literally \"elf-oppression\") means \"nightmare\". There is also evidence associating elves with illness, specifically epilepsy.\nIn a similar vein, elves are in Middle High German most often associated with deceiving or bewildering people in a phrase that occurs so often it would appear to be proverbial: (\"the elves/elf are/is deceiving me\"). The same pattern holds in Early Modern German. This deception sometimes shows the seductive side apparent in English and Scandinavian material: most famously, the early thirteenth-century Heinrich von Morungen's fifth \"Minnesang\" begins \"Von den elben wirt entsehen vil manic man / S\u00f4 bin ich von gr\u00f4zer liebe ents\u00ean\" (\"full many a man is bewitched by elves / thus I too am bewitched by great love\"). \"Elbe\" was also used in this period to translate words for nymphs.\nIn later medieval prayers, Elves appear as a threatening, even demonic, force. For example, there are prayers which invoke God's help against nocturnal attacks by \"Alpe\". Correspondingly, in the early modern period, elves are described in north Germany doing the evil bidding of witches; Martin Luther believed his mother to have been afflicted in this way.\nAs in Old Norse, however, there are few characters identified as elves. It seems likely that in the German-speaking world, elves were to a significant extent conflated with dwarves (). Thus, some dwarves that appear in German heroic poetry have been seen as relating to elves. In particular, nineteenth-century scholars tended to think that the dwarf Alberich, whose name etymologically means \"elf-powerful\", was influenced by early traditions of elves.\nPost-medieval folklore.\nBritain.\nFrom around the Late Middle Ages, the word \"elf\" began to be used in English as a term loosely synonymous with the French loan-word \"fairy\"; in elite art and literature, at least, it also became associated with diminutive supernatural beings like Puck, hobgoblins, Robin Goodfellow, the English and Scots brownie, and the Northumbrian English hob.\nHowever, in Scotland and parts of northern England near the Scottish border, beliefs in elves remained prominent into the nineteenth century. James VI of Scotland and Robert Kirk discussed elves seriously; elf beliefs are prominently attested in the Scottish witchcraft trials, particularly the trial of Issobel Gowdie; and related stories also appear in folktales, There is a significant corpus of ballads narrating stories about elves, such as \"Thomas the Rhymer\", where a man meets a female elf; \"Tam Lin\", \"The Elfin Knight\", and \"Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight\", in which an Elf-Knight rapes, seduces, or abducts a woman; and \"The Queen of Elfland's Nourice\", a woman is abducted to be a wet-nurse to the elf-queen's baby, but promised that she may return home once the child is weaned.\nScandinavia.\nTerminology.\nIn Scandinavian folklore, a diverse array of humanlike supernatural beings are attested which might be thought of as elves and which might partly originate in medieval Scandinavian beliefs. However, the characteristics and names of these beings have varied widely across time and space, and they cannot be neatly categorised. These beings are sometimes known by words descended directly from the Old Norse \"\u00e1lfr\". However, in the modern languages, traditional terms related to \"\u00e1lfr\" have tended to be replaced with other terms. Things are further complicated by the fact that when referring to the elves of Old Norse mythology, scholars have adopted new forms based directly on the Old Norse word \"\u00e1lfr\". The following table summarises the situation in the main modern standard languages of Scandinavia.\nAppearance and behaviour.\nThe elves of Norse mythology have survived into folklore mainly as females, living in hills and mounds of stones. The Swedish \"\u00e4lvor\" were stunningly beautiful girls who lived in the forest with an elven king.\nThe elves could be seen dancing over meadows, particularly at night and on misty mornings. They left a circle where they had danced, which were called \"\u00e4lvdanser\" (elf dances) or \"\u00e4lvringar\" (elf circles), and to urinate in one was thought to cause venereal diseases. Typically, elf circles were fairy rings consisting of a ring of small mushrooms, but there was also another kind of elf circle. In the words of the local historian Anne Marie Hellstr\u00f6m:\nIf a human watched the dance of the elves, he would discover that even though only a few hours seemed to have passed, many years had passed in the real world. Humans being invited or lured to the elf dance is a common motif transferred from older Scandinavian ballads.\nElves were not exclusively young and beautiful. In the Swedish folktale \"Little Rosa and Long Leda\", an elvish woman (\"\u00e4lvakvinna\") arrives in the end and saves the heroine, Little Rose, on condition that the king's cattle no longer graze on her hill. She is described as a beautiful old woman and by her aspect people saw that she belonged to the \"subterraneans\".\nIn ballads.\nElves have a prominent place in a number of closely related ballads which must have originated in the Middle Ages but are first attested in the early modern period. Many of these ballads are first attested in Karen Brahes Folio, a Danish manuscript from the 1570s, but they circulated widely in Scandinavia and northern Britain. Because they were learned by heart, they sometimes mention elves, even though that term had become archaic in everyday usage. They have therefore played a major role in transmitting traditional ideas about elves in post-medieval cultures. Some of the early modern ballads, indeed, are still quite widely known, whether through school syllabuses or modern folk music. They therefore give people an unusual degree of access to ideas of elves from older traditional culture.\nThe ballads are characterised by sexual encounters between everyday people and humanlike beings referred to in at least some variants as elves (the same characters also appear as mermen, dwarves, and other kinds of supernatural beings). The elves pose a threat to the everyday community by trying to lure people into the elves' world. The most popular example is \"Elveskud\" and its many variants (paralleled in English as \"Clerk Colvill\"), where a woman from the elf world tries to tempt a young knight to join her in dancing, or simply to live among the elves; in some versions he refuses and in some he accepts, but in either case he dies, tragically. As in \"Elveskud\", sometimes the everyday person is a man and the elf a woman, as also in \"Elveh\u00f8j\" (much the same story as \"Elveskud,\" but with a happy ending), \"Herr Magnus og Bj\u00e6rgtrolden\", \"Herr T\u00f8nne af Als\u00f8\", \"Herr B\u00f8smer i elvehjem\", or the Northern British \"Thomas the Rhymer\". Sometimes the everyday person is a woman and the elf is a man, as in the northern British \"Tam Lin\", \"The Elfin Knight\", and \"Lady Isabel and the Elf-Knight\", in which the Elf-Knight bears away Isabel to murder her, or the Scandinavian \"Harpans kraft\". In \"The Queen of Elfland's Nourice\", a woman is abducted to be a wet nurse to the elf-queen's baby, but promised that she may return home once the child is weaned.\nAs causes of illness.\nIn folk stories, Scandinavian elves often play the role of disease spirits. The most common, though also most harmless case was various irritating skin rashes, which were called \"\u00e4lvabl\u00e5st\" (elven puff) and could be cured by a forceful counter-blow (a handy pair of bellows was most useful for this purpose). \"Sk\u00e5lgropar\", a particular kind of petroglyph (pictogram on a rock) found in Scandinavia, were known in older times as \"\u00e4lvkvarnar\" (elven mills), because it was believed elves had used them. One could appease the elves by offering them a treat (preferably butter) placed into an elven mill.\nIn order to protect themselves and their livestock against malevolent elves, Scandinavians could use a so-called Elf cross (\"Alfkors\", \"\u00c4lvkors\" or \"Ellakors\"), which was carved into buildings or other objects. It existed in two shapes, one was a pentagram and it was still frequently used in early 20th-century Sweden as painted or carved onto doors, walls and household utensils in order to protect against elves. The second form was an ordinary cross carved onto a round or oblong silver plate. This second kind of elf cross was worn as a pendant in a necklace and in order to have sufficient magic it had to be forged during three evenings with silver, from nine different sources of inherited silver. In some locations it also had to be on the altar of a church for three consecutive Sundays.\nModern continuations.\nIn Iceland, expression of belief in the \"hulduf\u00f3lk\" (\"hidden people\"), elves that dwell in rock formations, is still relatively common. Even when Icelanders do not explicitly express their belief, they are often reluctant to express disbelief. A 2006 and 2007 study by the University of Iceland's Faculty of Social Sciences revealed that many would not rule out the existence of elves and ghosts, a result similar to a 1974 survey by Erlendur Haraldsson. The lead researcher of the 2006\u20132007 study, Terry Gunnell, stated: \"Icelanders seem much more open to phenomena like dreaming the future, forebodings, ghosts and elves than other nations\". Whether significant numbers of Icelandic people do believe in elves or not, elves are certainly prominent in national discourses. They occur most often in oral narratives and news reporting in which they disrupt house- and road-building. In the analysis of Valdimar Tr. Hafstein, \"narratives about the insurrections of elves demonstrate supernatural sanction against development and against urbanization; that is to say, the supernaturals protect and enforce pastoral values and traditional rural culture. The elves fend off, with more or less success, the attacks and advances of modern technology, palpable in the bulldozer.\" Elves are also prominent, in similar roles, in contemporary Icelandic literature.\nFolk stories told in the nineteenth century about elves are still told in modern Denmark and Sweden, but now feature ethnic minorities in place of elves in an essentially racist discourse. In an ethnically fairly homogeneous medieval countryside, supernatural beings provided the Other through which everyday people created their identities; in cosmopolitan industrial contexts, ethnic minorities or immigrants are used in storytelling to similar effect.\nPost-medieval elite culture.\nEarly modern elite culture.\nEarly modern Europe saw the emergence for the first time of a distinctive elite culture: while the Reformation encouraged new skepticism and opposition to traditional beliefs, subsequent Romanticism encouraged the fetishisation of such beliefs by intellectual elites. The effects of this on writing about elves are most apparent in England and Germany, with developments in each country influencing the other. In Scandinavia, the Romantic movement was also prominent, and literary writing was the main context for continued use of the word \"elf,\" except in fossilised words for illnesses. However, oral traditions about beings like elves remained prominent in Scandinavia into the early twentieth century.\nElves entered early modern elite culture most clearly in the literature of Elizabethan England. Here Edmund Spenser's \"Faerie Queene\" (1590\u2013) used \"fairy\" and \"elf\" interchangeably of human-sized beings, but they are complex, imaginary and allegorical figures. Spenser also presented his own explanation of the origins of the \"Elfe\" and \"Elfin kynd\", claiming that they were created by Prometheus. Likewise, William Shakespeare, in a speech in \"Romeo and Juliet\" (1592) has an \"elf-lock\" (tangled hair) being caused by Queen Mab, who is referred to as \"the fairies' midwife\". Meanwhile, \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\" promoted the idea that elves were diminutive and ethereal. The influence of Shakespeare and Michael Drayton made the use of \"elf\" and \"fairy\" for very small beings the norm, and had a lasting effect seen in fairy tales about elves, collected in the modern period.\nThe Romantic movement.\nEarly modern English notions of elves became influential in eighteenth-century Germany. The Modern German \"Elf\" (m) and \"Elfe\" (f) was introduced as a loan-word from English in the 1740s and was prominent in Christoph Martin Wieland's 1764 translation of \"A Midsummer Night's Dream\".\nAs German Romanticism got underway and writers started to seek authentic folklore, Jacob Grimm rejected \"Elf\" as a recent Anglicism, and promoted the reuse of the old form \"Elb\" (plural \"Elbe\" or \"Elben\"). In the same vein, Johann Gottfried Herder translated the Danish ballad \"Elveskud\" in his 1778 collection of folk songs, \", as \" (\"The Erl-king's Daughter\"; it appears that Herder introduced the term \"Erlk\u00f6nig\" into German through a mis-Germanisation of the Danish word for \"elf\"). This in turn inspired Goethe's poem \"Der Erlk\u00f6nig\". Goethe's poem then took on a life of its own, inspiring the Romantic concept of the Erlking, which was influential on literary images of elves from the nineteenth century on.\nIn Scandinavia too, in the nineteenth century, traditions of elves were adapted to include small, insect-winged fairies. These are often called \"elves\" (\"\u00e4lvor\" in modern Swedish, \"alfer\" in Danish, \"\u00e1lfar\" in Icelandic), although the more formal translation in Danish is \"feer\". Thus, the \"alf\" found in the fairy tale \"The Elf of the Rose\" by Danish author Hans Christian Andersen is so tiny he can have a rose blossom for home, and \"wings that reached from his shoulders to his feet\". Yet Andersen also wrote about \"elvere\" in \"The Elfin Hill\". The elves in this story are more alike those of traditional Danish folklore, who were beautiful females, living in hills and boulders, capable of dancing a man to death. Like the \"huldra\" in Norway and Sweden, they are hollow when seen from the back.\nEnglish and German literary traditions both influenced the British Victorian image of elves, which appeared in illustrations as tiny men and women with pointed ears and stocking caps. An example is Andrew Lang's fairy tale \"Princess Nobody\" (1884), illustrated by Richard Doyle, where fairies are tiny people with butterfly wings, whereas elves are tiny people with red stocking caps. These conceptions remained prominent in twentieth-century children's literature, for example Enid Blyton's The Faraway Tree series, and were influenced by German Romantic literature. Accordingly, in the Brothers Grimm fairy tale \"Die Wichtelm\u00e4nner\" (literally, \"the little men\"), the title protagonists are two tiny naked men who help a shoemaker in his work. Even though \"Wichtelm\u00e4nner\" are akin to beings such as kobolds, dwarves and brownies, the tale was translated into English by Margaret Hunt in 1884 as \"The Elves and the Shoemaker\". This shows how the meanings of \"elf\" had changed, and was in itself influential: the usage is echoed, for example, in the house-elf of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter stories. In his turn, J.\u00a0R.\u00a0R. Tolkien recommended using the older German form \"Elb\" in translations of his works, as recorded in his \"Guide to the Names in The Lord of the Rings\" (1967). \"Elb, Elben\" was consequently introduced in the 1972 German translation of \"The Lord of the Rings\", repopularising the form in German.\nIn popular culture.\nChristmas elf.\nWith industrialisation and mass education, traditional folklore about elves waned, but as the phenomenon of popular culture emerged, elves were reimagined, in large part on the basis of Romantic literary depictions and associated medievalism.\nAs American Christmas traditions crystallized in the nineteenth century, the 1823 poem \"A Visit from St. Nicholas\" (widely known as \"'Twas the Night before Christmas\") characterized St Nicholas himself as \"a right jolly old elf\". However, it was his little helpers, inspired partly by folktales like \"The Elves and the Shoemaker\", who became known as \"Santa's elves\"; the processes through which this came about are not well-understood, but one key figure was a Christmas-related publication by the German-American cartoonist Thomas Nast. Thus in the US, Canada, UK, and Ireland, the modern children's folklore of Santa Claus typically includes small, nimble, green-clad elves with pointy ears, long noses, and pointy hats, as Santa's helpers. They make the toys in a workshop located in the North Pole. The role of elves as Santa's helpers has continued to be popular, as evidenced by the success of the popular Christmas movie \"Elf\".\nFantasy fiction.\nThe fantasy genre in the twentieth century grew out of nineteenth-century Romanticism, in which nineteenth-century scholars such as Andrew Lang and the Grimm brothers collected fairy stories from folklore and in some cases retold them freely.\nA pioneering work of the fantasy genre was \"The King of Elfland's Daughter\", a 1924 novel by Lord Dunsany. The Elves of Middle-earth played a central role in Tolkien's legendarium, notably \"The Hobbit\" and \"The Lord of the Rings\"; this legendarium was enormously influential on subsequent fantasy writing. Tolkien's writing had such influence that in the 1960s and afterwards, elves speaking an elvish language similar to those in Tolkien's novels became staple non-human characters in high fantasy works and in fantasy role-playing games. Tolkien also appears to be the first author to have introduced the notion that elves are immortal. Post-Tolkien fantasy elves (which feature not only in novels but also in role-playing games such as \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\") are often portrayed as being wiser and more beautiful than humans, with sharper senses and perceptions as well. They are said to be gifted in magic, mentally sharp and lovers of nature, art, and song. They are often skilled archers. A hallmark of many fantasy elves is their pointed ears.\nIn works where elves are the main characters, such as \"The Silmarillion\" or Wendy and Richard Pini's comic book series \"Elfquest\", elves exhibit a similar range of behaviour to a human cast, distinguished largely by their superhuman physical powers. However, where narratives are more human-centered, as in \"The Lord of the Rings\", elves tend to sustain their role as powerful, sometimes threatening, outsiders. Despite the obvious fictionality of fantasy novels and games, scholars have found that elves in these works continue to have a subtle role in shaping the real-life identities of their audiences. For example, elves can function to encode real-world racial others in video games, or to influence gender norms through literature.\nEquivalents in non-Germanic traditions.\nBeliefs in humanlike supernatural beings are widespread in human cultures, and many such beings may be referred to as \"elves\" in English.\nEurope.\nElfish beings appear to have been a common characteristic within Indo-European mythologies. In the Celtic-speaking regions of north-west Europe, the beings most similar to elves are generally referred to with the Gaelic term \"Aos S\u00ed\". The equivalent term in modern Welsh is \"Tylwyth Teg\". In the Romance-speaking world, beings comparable to elves are widely known by words derived from Latin \"fata\" ('fate'), which came into English as \"fairy\". This word became partly synonymous with \"elf\" by the early modern period. Other names also abound, however, such as the Sicilian \"Donas de fuera\" ('ladies from outside'), or French \"bonnes dames\" ('good ladies'). In the Finnic-speaking world, the term usually thought most closely equivalent to \"elf\" is \"haltija\" (in Finnish) or \"haldaja\" (Estonian). Meanwhile, an example of an equivalent in the Slavic-speaking world is the \"vila\" (plural \"vile\") of Serbo-Croatian (and, partly, Slovene) folklore. Elves bear some resemblances to the satyrs of Greek mythology, who were also regarded as woodland-dwelling mischief-makers.\nAsia and Oceania.\nSome scholarship draws parallels between the Arabian tradition of \"jinn\" with the elves of medieval Germanic-language cultures. Some of the comparisons are quite precise: for example, the root of the word \"jinn\" was used in medieval Arabic terms for madness and possession in similar ways to the Old English word \"ylfig\", which was derived from \"elf\" and also denoted prophetic states of mind implicitly associated with elfish possession.\nKhmer culture in Cambodia includes the \"Mrenh kongveal\", elfish beings associated with guarding animals.\nIn the animistic precolonial beliefs of the Philippines, the world can be divided into the material world and the spirit world. All objects, animate or inanimate, has a spirit called \"anito\". Non-human \"anito\" are known as \"diwata\", usually euphemistically referred to as \"dili ingon nato\" ('those unlike us'). They inhabit natural features like mountains, forests, old trees, caves, reefs, etc., as well as personify abstract concepts and natural phenomena. They are similar to elves in that they can be helpful or malevolent, but are usually indifferent to mortals. They can be mischievous and cause unintentional harm to humans, but they can also deliberately cause illnesses and misfortunes when disrespected or angered. Spanish colonizers equated them with elf and fairy folklore.\nOrang bunian are supernatural beings in Malaysian, Bruneian and Indonesian folklore, invisible to most humans except those with spiritual sight. While the term is often translated as \"elves\", it literally translates to \"hidden people\" or \"whistling people\". Their appearance is nearly identical to humans dressed in an ancient Southeast Asian style.\nIn M\u0101ori culture, Patupaiarehe are beings similar to European elves and fairies."}
{"id": "9897", "revid": "7903804", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9897", "title": "Evil", "text": "Evil, in a general sense, is defined by what it is not\u2014the opposite or absence of good. It can be an extremely broad concept, although in everyday usage it is often more narrowly used to talk about profound wickedness. It is generally seen as taking multiple possible forms, such as the form of personal moral evil commonly associated with the word, or impersonal natural evil (as in the case of natural disasters or illnesses), and in religious thought, the form of the demonic or supernatural/eternal. While some religions, world views, and philosophies focus on \"good versus evil\", others deny evil's existence and usefulness in describing people.\nEvil can denote profound immorality, but typically not without some basis in the understanding of the human condition, where strife and suffering (cf. Hinduism) are the true roots of evil. In certain religious contexts, evil has been described as a supernatural force. Definitions of evil vary, as does the analysis of its motives. Elements that are commonly associated with personal forms of evil involve unbalanced behavior including anger, revenge, hatred, psychological trauma, expediency, selfishness, ignorance, destruction and neglect.\nIn some forms of thought, evil is also sometimes perceived as the dualistic antagonistic binary opposite to good, in which good should prevail and evil should be defeated. In cultures with Buddhist spiritual influence, both good and evil are perceived as part of an antagonistic duality that itself must be overcome through achieving \"Nirvana\". The ethical questions regarding good and evil are subsumed into three major areas of study: meta-ethics concerning the nature of good and evil, normative ethics concerning how we ought to behave, and applied ethics concerning particular moral issues. While the term is applied to events and conditions without agency, the forms of evil addressed in this article presume one or more evildoers.\nEtymology.\nThe modern English word \"evil\" (Old English ) and its cognates such as the German and Dutch are widely considered to come from a Proto-Germanic reconstructed form of \"*ubilaz\", comparable to the Hittite \"huwapp-\" ultimately from the Proto-Indo-European form and suffixed zero-grade form . Other later Germanic forms include Middle English , , , Old Frisian (adjective and noun), Old Saxon , Old High German , and Gothic .\nThe root meaning of the word is of obscure origin though shown to be akin to modern German \"\" (although \"evil\" is normally translated as \"Das B\u00f6se\") with the basic idea of transgressing.\nChinese moral philosophy.\nAs with Buddhism, in Confucianism or Taoism there is no direct analogue to the way \"good and evil\" are opposed although reference to \"demonic influence\" is common in Chinese folk religion. Confucianism's primary concern is with correct social relationships and the behavior appropriate to the learned or superior man. Thus \"evil\" would correspond to wrong behavior. Still less does it map into Taoism, in spite of the centrality of dualism in that system, but the opposite of the cardinal virtues of Taoism, compassion, moderation, and humility can be inferred to be the analogue of evil in it.\nEuropean philosophy.\nSpinoza.\nBenedict de Spinoza states\nSpinoza assumes a quasi-mathematical style and states these further propositions which he purports to prove or demonstrate from the above definitions in part IV of his \"Ethics\" :\nNietzsche.\nFriedrich Nietzsche, in a rejection of Judeo-Christian morality, addresses this in two works \"Beyond Good and Evil\" and \"On the Genealogy of Morals\" where he essentially says that the natural, functional non-good has been socially transformed into the religious concept of evil by the slave mentality of the weak and oppressed masses who resent their masters (the strong).\nPsychology.\nCarl Jung.\nCarl Jung, in his book \"Answer to Job\" and elsewhere, depicted evil as the \"dark side of God\". People tend to believe evil is something external to them, because they project their shadow onto others. Jung interpreted the story of Jesus as an account of God facing his own shadow.\nPhilip Zimbardo.\nIn 2007, Philip Zimbardo suggested that people may act in evil ways as a result of a collective identity. This hypothesis, based on his previous experience from the Stanford prison experiment, was published in the book \"The Lucifer Effect: Understanding How Good People Turn Evil\".\nReligion.\nProblem of evil and source.\nMost monotheistic religions posit that the singular God is all-powerful, all-knowing, and completely good. The problem of evil asks how the apparent contradiction of these properties and the observed existence of evil in the world might be resolved. Scholars have examined the question of suffering caused by and in both humans and animals, suffering caused by nature (like storms and disease). These religions tend to attribute the source of evil to something other than God, such as demonic beings or human disobedience.\nPolytheistic and non-theistic religions do not have such an apparent contradiction, but many seek to explain or identify the source of evil or suffering. These include concepts of evil as a necessary balancing or enabling force, a consequence of past deeds (karma in Indian religions), or as an illusion, possibly produced by ignorance or failure to achieve enlightenment.\nNon-religious atheism generally accepts evil acts as a feature of human actions arising from intelligent brains shaped by evolution, and suffering from nature as a result of complex natural systems simply following physical laws.\nAbrahamic religions.\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nThe Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith asserts that evil is non-existent and that it is a concept reflecting lack of good, just as cold is the state of no heat, darkness is the state of no light, forgetfulness the lacking of memory, ignorance the lacking of knowledge. All of these are states of lacking and have no real existence.\nThus, evil does not exist and is relative to man. `Abdu'l-Bah\u00e1, son of the founder of the religion, in Some Answered Questions states:\n\"Nevertheless a doubt occurs to the mind\u2014that is, scorpions and serpents are poisonous. Are they good or evil, for they are existing beings? Yes, a scorpion is evil in relation to man; a serpent is evil in relation to man; but in relation to themselves they are not evil, for their poison is their weapon, and by their sting they defend themselves.\"\nThus, evil is more of an intellectual concept than a true reality. Since God is good, and upon creating creation he confirmed it by saying it is Good (Genesis 1:31) evil cannot have a true reality.\nChristianity.\nChristian theology draws its concept of evil from the Old and New Testaments. The Christian Bible exercises \"the dominant influence upon ideas about God and evil in the Western world.\" In the Old Testament, evil is understood to be an opposition to God as well as something unsuitable or inferior such as the leader of the fallen angels Satan In the New Testament the Greek word \"poneros\" is used to indicate unsuitability, while \"kakos\" is used to refer to opposition to God in the human realm. Officially, the Catholic Church extracts its understanding of evil from its canonical antiquity and the Dominican theologian, Thomas Aquinas, who in \"Summa Theologica\" defines evil as the absence or privation of good. French-American theologian Henri Blocher describes evil, when viewed as a theological concept, as an \"unjustifiable reality. In common parlance, evil is 'something' that occurs in the experience that \"ought not to be\".\"\nIn Mormonism, mortal life is viewed as a test of faith, where one's choices are central to the Plan of Salvation. See Agency (LDS Church). Evil is that which keeps one from discovering the nature of God. It is believed that one must choose not to be evil to return to God.\nChristian Science believes that evil arises from a misunderstanding of the goodness of nature, which is understood as being inherently perfect if viewed from the correct (spiritual) perspective. Misunderstanding God's reality leads to incorrect choices, which are termed evil. This has led to the rejection of any separate power being the source of evil, or of God as being the source of evil; instead, the appearance of evil is the result of a mistaken concept of good. Christian Scientists argue that even the most \"evil\" person does not pursue evil for its own sake, but from the mistaken viewpoint that he or she will achieve some kind of good thereby.\nIslam.\nThere is no concept of absolute evil in Islam, as a fundamental universal principle that is independent from and equal with good in a dualistic sense. Although the Quran mentions the biblical forbidden tree, it never refers to it as the 'tree of knowledge of good and evil'. Within Islam, it is considered essential to believe that all comes from God, whether it is perceived as good or bad by individuals; and things that are perceived as \"evil\" or \"bad\" are either natural events (natural disasters or illnesses) or caused by humanity's free will. Much more the behavior of beings with free will, then they disobey God's orders, harming others or putting themselves over God or others, is considered to be evil. Evil doesn't necessarily refer to evil as an ontological or moral category, but often to harm or as the intention and consequence of an action, but also to unlawfull actions.\nUnproductive actions or those who do not produce benefits are also thought of as evil.\nA typical understanding of evil is reflected by Al-Ash`ari founder of Asharism. Accordingly, qualifying something as evil depends on the circumstances of the observer. An event or an action itself is neutral, but it receives its qualification by God. Since God is omnipotent and nothing can exist outside of God's power, God's will determine, whether or not something is evil.\nJudaism.\nIn Judaism, evil is not real, it is per se not part of God's creation, but comes into existence through man's bad actions. Human beings are responsible for their choices, and so have the free will to choose good (life in olam haba) or bad (death in heaven). (Deuteronomy 28:20) Judaism stresses obedience to God's 613 commandments of the Written Torah (see also Tanakh) and the collective body of Jewish religious laws expounded in the Oral Torah and Shulchan Aruch (see also Mishnah and the Talmud). In Judaism, there is no prejudice in one's becoming good or evil at the time of birth, since full responsibility comes with Bar and Bat Mitzvah, when Jewish boys become 13, and girls become 12 years old.\nAncient Egyptian Religion.\nEvil in the religion of ancient Egypt is known as Isfet, \"disorder/violence\". It is the opposite of Maat, \"order\", and embodied by the serpent god Apep, who routinely attempts to kill the sun god Ra and is stopped by nearly every other deity. Isfet is not a primordial force, but the consequence of free will and an individual's struggle against the non-existence embodied by Apep, as evidenced by the fact that it was born from Ra's umbilical cord instead of being recorded in the religion's creation myths.\nIndian religions.\nBuddhism.\nThe primal duality in Buddhism is between suffering and enlightenment, so the good vs. evil splitting has no direct analogue in it. One may infer from the general teachings of the Buddha that the catalogued causes of suffering are what correspond in this belief system to 'evil'.\nPractically this can refer to 1) the three selfish emotions\u2014desire, hate and delusion; and 2) to their expression in physical and verbal actions. Specifically, \"evil\" means whatever harms or obstructs the causes for happiness in this life, a better rebirth, liberation from samsara, and the true and complete enlightenment of a buddha (samyaksambodhi).\n\"What is evil? Killing is evil, lying is evil, slandering is evil, abuse is evil, gossip is evil: envy is evil, hatred is evil, to cling to false doctrine is evil; all these things are evil. And what is the root of evil? Desire is the root of evil, illusion is the root of evil.\" Gautama Siddhartha, the founder of Buddhism, 563\u2013483 BC.\nHinduism.\nIn Hinduism, the concept of Dharma or righteousness clearly divides the world into good and evil, and clearly explains that wars have to be waged sometimes to establish and protect Dharma, this war is called Dharmayuddha. This division of good and evil is of major importance in both the Hindu epics of Ramayana and Mahabharata. The main emphasis in Hinduism is on bad action, rather than bad people. The Hindu holy text, the Bhagavad Gita, speaks of the balance of good and evil. When this balance goes off, divine incarnations come to help to restore this balance.\nSikhism.\nIn adherence to the core principle of spiritual evolution, the Sikh idea of evil changes depending on one's position on the path to liberation. At the beginning stages of spiritual growth, good and evil may seem neatly separated. Once one's spirit evolves to the point where it sees most clearly, the idea of evil vanishes and the truth is revealed. In his writings Guru Arjan explains that, because God is the source of all things, what we believe to be evil must too come from God. And because God is ultimately a source of absolute good, nothing truly evil can originate from God.\nNevertheless, Sikhism, like many other religions, does incorporate a list of \"vices\" from which suffering, corruption, and abject negativity arise. These are known as the Five Thieves, called such due to their propensity to cloud the mind and lead one astray from the prosecution of righteous action. These are:\nOne who gives in to the temptations of the Five Thieves is known as \"Manmukh\", or someone who lives selfishly and without virtue. Inversely, the \"Gurmukh, who thrive in their reverence toward divine knowledge, rise above vice via the practice of the high virtues of Sikhism. These are:\nZoroastrianism.\nIn the originally Persian religion of Zoroastrianism, the world is a battleground between the god Ahura Mazda (also called Ormazd) and the malignant spirit Angra Mainyu (also called Ahriman). The final resolution of the struggle between good and evil was supposed to occur on a day of Judgement, in which all beings that have lived will be led across a bridge of fire, and those who are evil will be cast down forever. In Afghan belief, angels and saints are beings sent to help us achieve the path towards goodness.\nQuestion of a universal definition.\nA fundamental question is whether there is a universal, transcendent definition of evil, or whether one's definition of evil is determined by one's social or cultural background. C. S. Lewis, in \"The Abolition of Man\", maintained that there are certain acts that are universally considered evil, such as rape and murder. However, the rape of women, by men, is found in every society, and there are more societies that see at least some versions of it, such as marital rape or punitive rape, as normative than there are societies that see all rape as non-normative (a crime). In nearly all societies, killing except for defense or duty is seen as murder. Yet the definition of defense and duty varies from one society to another. Stanley Milgram's 1974 experiments were designed to explain how thousands of ordinary, non-deviant, people could have reconciled themselves to a role in the Holocaust. He showed that ordinary humans have the capacity for evil behavior when influenced, manipulated, or pressed into it by authority figures. Social deviance is not uniformly defined across different cultures, and is not, in all circumstances, a necessarily aspect of evil.\nDefining evil is complicated by its multiple, often ambiguous, common usages: evil is used to describe the whole range of suffering, including that caused by nature, and it is also used to describe the full range of human immorality from the \"evil of genocide to the evil of malicious gossip\". It is sometimes thought of as the generic opposite of good. Marcus Singer asserts that these common connotations must be set aside as overgeneralized ideas that don't sufficiently describe the nature of evil.\nIn contemporary philosophy, there are two basic concepts of evil: a broad concept and a narrow concept. A broad concept defines evil simply as any and all pain and suffering: \"any bad state of affairs, wrongful action, or character flaw\". Yet, it is also asserted that evil cannot be correctly understood \"(as some of the utilitarians once thought) [on] a simple hedonic scale on which pleasure appears as a plus, and pain as a minus\". This is because pain is necessary for survival. Renowned orthopedist and missionary to lepers, Dr. Paul Brand explains that leprosy attacks the nerve cells that feel pain resulting in no more pain for the leper, which leads to ever increasing, often catastrophic, damage to the body of the leper. Congenital insensitivity to pain (CIP), also known as congenital analgesia, is a neurological disorder that prevents feeling pain. It \"leads to ...bone fractures, multiple scars, osteomyelitis, joint deformities, and limb amputation... Mental retardation is common. Death from hyperpyrexia occurs within the first 3 years of life in almost 20% of the patients.\" Few with the disorder are able to live into adulthood. Evil cannot be simply defined as all pain and its connected suffering because, as Marcus Singer says: \"If something is really evil, it can't be necessary, and if it is really necessary, it can't be evil\".\nThe narrow concept of evil involves moral condemnation, therefore it is ascribed only to moral agents and their actions. This eliminates natural disasters and animal suffering from consideration as evil: according to Claudia Card, \"When not guided by moral agents, forces of nature are neither \"goods\" nor \"evils\". They just are. Their \"agency\" routinely produces consequences vital to some forms of life and lethal to others\". The narrow definition of evil \"picks out only the most morally despicable sorts of actions, characters, events, etc. \"Evil\" [in this sense] \u2026 is the worst possible term of opprobrium imaginable\u201d. Eve Garrard suggests that evil describes \"particularly horrifying kinds of action which we feel are to be contrasted with more ordinary kinds of wrongdoing, as when for example we might say 'that action wasn't just wrong, it was positively evil'. The implication is that there is a qualitative, and not merely quantitative, difference between evil acts and other wrongful ones; evil acts are not just very bad or wrongful acts, but rather ones possessing some specially horrific quality\". In this context, the concept of evil is one element in a full nexus of moral concepts.\nPhilosophical questions.\nApproaches.\nViews on the nature of evil belong to the branch of philosophy known as ethics\u2014which in modern philosophy is subsumed into three major areas of study:\nUsefulness as a term.\nThere is debate on how useful the term \"evil\" is, since it is often associated with spirits and the devil. Some see the term as useless because they say it lacks any real ability to explain what it names. There is also real danger of the harm that being labeled \"evil\" can do when used in moral, political, and legal contexts. Those who support the usefulness of the term say there is a secular view of evil that offers plausible analyses without reference to the supernatural. Garrard and Russell argue that evil is as useful an explanation as any moral concept. Garrard adds that evil actions result from a particular kind of motivation, such as taking pleasure in the suffering of others, and this distinctive motivation provides a partial explanation even if it does not provide a complete explanation. Most theorists agree use of the term evil can be harmful but disagree over what response that requires. Some argue it is \"more dangerous to ignore evil than to try to understand it\".\nThose who support the usefulness of the term, such as Eve Garrard and David McNaughton, argue that the term evil \"captures a distinct part of our moral phenomenology, specifically, 'collect[ing] together those wrongful actions to which we have ... a response of moral horror'.\" Claudia Card asserts it is only by understanding the nature of evil that we can preserve humanitarian values and prevent evil in the future. If evils are the worst sorts of moral wrongs, social policy should focus limited energy and resources on reducing evil over other wrongs. Card asserts that by categorizing certain actions and practices as evil, we are better able to recognize and guard against responding to evil with more evil which will \"interrupt cycles of hostility generated by past evils\".\nOne school of thought holds that no \"person\" is evil and that only \"acts\" may be properly considered evil. Some theorists define an evil action simply as a kind of action an evil person performs. But just as many theorists believe that an evil character is one who is inclined toward evil acts.\nLuke Russell argues that both evil actions and evil feelings are necessary to identify a person as evil, while Daniel Haybron argues that evil feelings and evil motivations are necessary.\nAmerican psychiatrist M. Scott Peck describes evil as a kinf of personal \"militant ignorance\". According to Peck, an evil person is consistently self-deceiving, deceives others, Psychologically projects his or her evil onto very specific targets,; hates, abuses power, and lies incessantly. Evil people are unable to think from the viewpoint of their victim. Peck considers those he calls evil to be attempting to escape and hide from their own conscience (through self-deception) and views this as being quite distinct from the apparent absence of conscience evident in sociopaths. He also considers that certain institutions may be evil, using the My Lai Massacre to illustrate. By this definition, acts of criminal and state terrorism would also be considered evil.\nNecessity.\nMartin Luther argued that there are cases where a little evil is a positive good. He wrote, \"Seek out the society of your boon companions, drink, play, talk bawdy, and amuse yourself. One must sometimes commit a sin out of hate and contempt for the Devil, so as not to give him the chance to make one scrupulous over mere nothings\u00a0... \"\nAccording to the \"realist\" schools of political philosophy, leaders should be indifferent to good or evil, taking actions based only upon advantage; this approach to politics was put forth most famously by Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, a 16th-century Florentine writer who advised tyrants that \"it is far safer to be feared than loved.\"\nThe international relations theories of realism and neorealism, sometimes called \"realpolitik\" advise politicians to explicitly ban absolute moral and ethical considerations from international politics, and to focus on self-interest, political survival, and power politics, which they hold to be more accurate in explaining a world they view as explicitly amoral and dangerous. Political realists usually justify their perspectives by stating that morals and politics should be separated as two unrelated things, as exerting authority often involves doing something not moral. Machiavelli wrote: \"there will be traits considered good that, if followed, will lead to ruin, while other traits, considered vices which if practiced achieve security and well being for the prince.\"\nAnton LaVey, founder of the Church of Satan, was a materialist and claimed that evil is actually good. He was responding to the common practice of describing sexuality or disbelief as evil, and his claim was that when the word \"evil\" is used to describe the natural pleasures and instincts of men and women or the skepticism of an inquiring mind, the things called and feared as evil are really non-evil and in fact good.\nReferences.\nNotes\nFurther reading"}

{"id": "9901", "revid": "19877", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9901", "title": "Epistle to the Hebrews", "text": "The Epistle to the Hebrews, or Letter to the Hebrews, or in the Greek manuscripts, simply To the Hebrews (\u03a0\u03c1\u1f78\u03c2 \u1f19\u03b2\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2) is one of the books of the New Testament.\nThe text does not mention the name of its author, but was traditionally attributed to Paul the Apostle. However, doubt on Pauline authorship in the Roman Church is reported by Eusebius. Modern biblical scholarship considers its authorship unknown, perhaps written in deliberate imitation of the style of Paul. Although the writer's style reflects some characteristics of Paul's writing, there are some differences.\nScholars of Greek consider its writing to be more polished and eloquent than any other book of the New Testament, and \"the very carefully composed and studied Greek of Hebrews is not Paul's spontaneous, volatile contextual Greek\". The book has earned the reputation of being a masterpiece. It has also been described as an intricate New Testament book. Some scholars believe it was written for Jewish Christians who lived in Jerusalem. Its purpose was to exhort Christians to persevere in the face of persecution. At this time, certain believers were considering turning back to Judaism (the Jewish system of law) to escape being persecuted for accepting Christ as their saviour, now following this system of grace (saved by Jesus' sacrifice on the cross). The theme of the epistle is the doctrine of the person of Christ and his role as mediator between God and humanity.\nAccording to traditional scholarship, the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, following in the footsteps of Paul, argued that Jewish Law, the cornerstone of the beliefs and traditions of the descendants of the founding fathers, had played a legitimate role in the past but was superseded by a new covenant that applies to Gentiles (cf. Rom. 7:1\u20136; Gal. 3:23\u201325; Heb. 8, 10). However, a growing number of scholars point that the terms Gentile, Christian and Christianity are not present in the text and posit that Hebrews was written for a Jewish audience, and is best seen as a debate between Jewish followers of Jesus and mainstream Judaism. In tone, and detail, Hebrews goes beyond Paul and attempts a more complex, nuanced, and openly adversarial definition of the relationship. The epistle opens with an exaltation of Jesus as \"the radiance of God's glory, the express image of his being, and upholding all things by his powerful word\". The epistle presents Jesus with the titles \"pioneer\" or \"forerunner\", \"Son\" and \"Son of God\", \"priest\" and \"high priest\". The epistle casts Jesus as both exalted Son and high priest, a unique dual Christology.\nComposition.\nHebrews uses Old Testament quotations interpreted in light of first-century rabbinical Judaism. New Testament and Second Temple Judaism scholar Eric Mason argues that the conceptual background of the priestly Christology of the Epistle to the Hebrews closely parallels presentations of the messianic priest and Melchizedek in the Qumran scrolls. In both Hebrews and Qumran a priestly figure is discussed in the context of a Davidic figure; in both cases a divine decree appoints the priests to their eschatological duty; both priestly figures offer an eschatological sacrifice of atonement. Although the author of Hebrews was not directly influenced by Qumran's \"Messiah of Aaron\", these and other conceptions did provide \"a precedent... to conceive Jesus similarly as a priest making atonement and eternal intercession in the heavenly sanctuary\".\nAuthorship.\nBy the end of the first century there was no consensus on the author's identity. Clement of Rome, Barnabas, Paul the Apostle, and other names were proposed. Others later suggested Luke the Evangelist, Apollos, or his teacher Priscilla as possible authors.\nIn the 3rd century, Origen wrote of the letter,\nIn the epistle entitled \"To The Hebrews\" the diction does not exhibit the characteristic roughness of speech or phraseology admitted by the Apostle [Paul] himself, the construction of the sentences is closer to the Greek usage, as anyone capable of recognising differences of style would agree. On the other hand the matter of the epistle is wonderful, and quite equal to the Apostle's acknowledged writings: the truth of this would be admitted by anyone who has read the Apostle carefully... If I were asked my personal opinion, I would say that the matter is the Apostle's but the phraseology and construction are those of someone who remembered the Apostle's teaching and wrote his own interpretation of what his master had said. So if any church regards this epistle as Paul's, it should be commended for so doing, for the primitive Church had every justification for handing it down as his. Who wrote the epistle is known to God alone: the accounts that have reached us suggest that it was either Clement, who became Bishop of Rome, or Luke, who wrote the gospel and the Acts. \nIn the 4th century, Jerome and Augustine of Hippo supported Paul's authorship: the Church largely agreed to include Hebrews as the fourteenth letter of Paul, and affirmed this authorship until the Reformation. Scholars argued that in the 13th chapter of Hebrews, Timothy is referred to as a companion. Timothy was Paul's missionary companion in the same way Jesus sent disciples out in pairs. Also, the writer states that he wrote the letter from \"Italy\", which also at the time fits Paul. The difference in style is explained as simply an adjustment to a distinct audience, to the Jewish Christians who were being persecuted and pressured to go back to traditional Judaism.\nMany scholars now believe that the author was one of Paul's pupils or associates, citing stylistic differences between Hebrews and the other Pauline epistles. Recent scholarship has favored the idea that the author was probably a leader of a predominantly Jewish congregation to whom he or she was writing.\nBecause of its anonymity, it had some trouble being accepted as part of the Christian canon, being classed with the Antilegomena. Eventually it was accepted as scripture because of its sound theology, eloquent presentation, and other intrinsic factors. In antiquity, certain circles began to ascribe it to Paul in an attempt to provide the anonymous work an explicit apostolic pedigree.\nThe original King James Version of the Bible titled the work \"The Epistle of Paul the Apostle to the Hebrews\". However, the KJV's attribution to Paul was only a guess, and is currently disputed by recent research. Its vastly different style, different theological focus, different spiritual experience, different Greek vocabulary \u2013 all are believed to make Paul's authorship of Hebrews increasingly indefensible. At present, neither modern scholarship nor church teaching ascribes Hebrews to Paul.\nA.J. Gordon ascribes the authorship of Hebrews to Priscilla, writing that \"It is evident that the Holy Spirit made this woman Priscilla a teacher of teachers\". Later proposed by Adolf von Harnack in 1900, Harnack's reasoning won the support of prominent Bible scholars of the early twentieth century. Harnack believes the letter was written in Rome \u2013 not to the Church, but to the inner circle. In setting forth his evidence for Priscillan authorship, he finds it amazing that the name of the author was blotted out by the earliest tradition. Citing , he says it was written by a person of \"high standing and apostolic teacher of equal rank with Timothy\". If Luke, Clemens, Barnabas, or Apollos had written it, Harnack believes their names would not have been obliterated.\nDonald Guthrie\u2019s commentary \"The Letter to the Hebrews\" (1983) mentions Priscilla by name as a suggested author.\nBelieving the author to have been Priscilla, Ruth Hoppin posits that the name was omitted either to suppress its female authorship, or to protect the letter itself from suppression.\nAlso convinced that Priscilla was the author of Hebrews, Gilbert Bilezikian, professor of biblical studies at Wheaton College, remarks on \"the conspiracy of anonymity in the ancient church,\" and reasons: \"The lack of any firm data concerning the identity of the author in the extant writings of the church suggests a deliberate blackout more than a case of collective loss of memory.\"\nDate.\nThe use of tabernacle terminology in Hebrews has been used to date the epistle before the destruction of the temple, the idea being that knowing about the destruction of both Jerusalem and the temple would have influenced the development of the author's overall argument. Therefore, the most probable date for its composition is the second half of the year 63 or the beginning of 64, according to the \"Catholic Encyclopedia\".\nThe text itself, for example, makes a contrast between the resurrected Christ \"in heaven\" \"who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord\" and the version on earth, where \"there are already priests who offer the gifts prescribed by the law. They serve at a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of what is in heaven.\" (NIV version)\nDespite this, some scholars, such as Harold Attridge and Ellen Aitken, hold to a later date of composition, between 70 and 100 AD.\nAudience.\nScholars have suggested that Hebrews is part of an internal New Testament debate between the extreme Judaizers (who argued that non-Jews must convert to Judaism before they can receive the Holy Spirit of Jesus' new covenant) versus the extreme antinomians (who argued that Jews must reject God's commandments and that Jewish law was no longer in effect). James and Paul represent the moderates of each faction, respectively, and Peter served as moderator.\nIt sets before the Jew the claims of Christianity \u2013 to bring the Jew to the full realization of the relation of Judaism to Christianity, to make clear that Christ has fulfilled those temporary and provisional institutions, and has thus abolished them. This view is commonly referred to as Supersessionism.\nAccording to the theology of supersessionism, the church replaces Israel, and thus the church takes the place of Israel as the people of God. The dominant interpretation in modern Hebrews scholarship has been that the epistle contains an implicit supersessionist claim (that the Levitical sacrifices and the Levitical priests have been replaced/superseded by Christ's sacrifice). Per Bibliowicz, Hebrews scholars may be divided into those that are supportive-sympathetic to the epistle's theological message, those that are critical of the epistle's supersessionary message, and those attempting a middle ground.\nDue to the importance of Hebrews for the formation of future Christian attitudes toward Jews and Judaism, a distinction must be made between the author's intent and the way in which the text was interpreted by future generations. The impact of the deployment and implementation of supersession theology is difficult to convey and grasp. The implementation of this theological claim eventually led to the negation and disenfranchisement of the Jewish followers of Jesus, and later, of all Jews.\nPurpose for writing.\nThose to whom Hebrews is written seem to have begun to doubt whether Jesus could really be the Messiah for whom they were waiting, because they believed the Messiah prophesied in the Hebrew Scriptures was to come as a militant king and destroy the enemies of his people. Jesus, however, came as a mere man who was arrested by the Jewish leaders and who suffered and was crucified by the Romans. And although he was seen resurrected, he still left the earth and his people, who now face persecution rather than victory. The Book of Hebrews solves this problem by arguing that the Hebrew Scriptures also foretold that the Messiah would be a priest (although of a different sort than the traditional Levitical priests) and Jesus came to fulfill this role, as a sacrificial offering to God, to atone for sins. His role of a king is yet to come, and so those who follow him should be patient and not be surprised that they suffer for now.\nSome scholars today believe the document was written to prevent apostasy. Some have interpreted apostasy to mean a number of different things, such as a group of Christians in one sect leaving for another more conservative sect, one of which the author disapproves. Some have seen apostasy as a move from the Christian assembly to pagan ritual. In light of a possibly Jewish-Christian audience, the apostasy in this sense may be in regard to Jewish-Christians leaving the Christian assembly to return to the Jewish synagogue. The author writes, \"Let us hold fast to our confession\". The epistle has been viewed as a long, rhetorical argument for having confidence in the new way to God revealed in Jesus Christ.\nThe book could be argued to affirm special creation. It affirms that God by His Son, Jesus Christ, made the worlds. \"God... hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son... by whom also he made the worlds\". The epistle also emphasizes the importance of faith. \"Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of things which do appear\".\nStyle.\nHebrews is a very consciously \"literary\" document. The purity of its Greek was noted by Clement of Alexandria, according to Eusebius (\"Historia Eccl.\", VI, xiv), and Origen of Alexandria asserted that every competent judge must recognize a great difference between this epistle and those of Paul (Eusebius, VI, xxv).\nThis letter consists of two strands: an expositional or doctrinal strand, and a hortatory or strongly urging strand which punctuates the exposition parenthetically at key points as warnings to the readers. \nHebrews does not fit the form of a traditional Hellenistic epistle, lacking a proper prescript. Modern scholars generally believe this book was originally a sermon or homily, although possibly modified after it was delivered to include the travel plans, greetings and closing. \nHebrews contains many references to the Old Testament \u2013 specifically to its Septuagint text.\nChristology.\nThe \"Epistle to the Hebrews\" is notable for the manner in which it expresses the divine nature of Christ. As A.C. Purdy summarized for \"The Interpreter's Bible\" (1955):\nWe may sum up our author\u2019s Christology negatively by saying that he has nothing to do with the older Hebrew messianic hopes of a coming Son of David, who would be a divinely empowered human leader to bring in the kingdom of God on earth; and that while he still employs the figure of a militant, apocalyptic king... who will come again..., this is not of the essence of his thought about Christ.\nPositively, our author presents Christ as divine in nature, and solves any possible objection to a divine being who participates in human experience, especially in the experience of death, by the priestly analogy. He seems quite unconscious of the logical difficulties of his position proceeding from the assumption that Christ is both divine and human, at least human in experience although hardly in nature.\nMikeal Parsons has commented:\nIf the humanity of Jesus is an important theme for Hebrews, how much more is Jesus\u2019 deity. While this theme of exaltation is asserted \u2018in many and various ways\u2019 we shall content ourselves by considering how the writer addresses this theme by asserting Jesus\u2019 superiority to a) angels, and b) Moses. The first chapter of Hebrews stresses the superiority of the Son to the angels. The very name \u2018Son\u2019 indicates superiority. This exaltation theme, in which the Son is contrasted with the angels (1:4), is expanded in the following string of OT quotations (1:5-13). While some have understood the catena as referring primarily to Christ\u2019s pre-existence, it is more likely that the verses should be understood, \u2018as a Christological hymn which traces the entire Christ event, including the pre-existence, earthly life, and exaltation of Christ\u2019. The overall structure of the catena seems to point to exaltation as the underlying motif... At least it may be concluded that the superiority of the Son is demonstrated by this comparison/contrast with angels.\nPeter Rhea Jones has reminded us that \u2018Moses is not merely one of the figures compared unfavourably to Jesus\u2019; but rather, \u2018Moses and Jesus are yoked throughout the entirety of the epistle\u2019. Allowing that Moses is much more than a \u2018whipping boy\u2019 for the author, the fact remains that the figure Moses is utilized as a basis for Christology. While there are several references to Moses, only two will be needed to demonstrate Jesus\u2019 superiority. The first passage to be considered is Hebrews 3:1-6. D\u2019Angelo and others regard the larger context of this passage (3:1-4:16) to be the superiority of Christ\u2019s message to the Law. While the comparison between Jesus and the angels is based on a number of OT citations, the comparison of Jesus and Moses turns on a single verse, Nu. 12:7. Like the angels (1:14), Moses was a servant who witnessed, as it were, to the Son. In other words, \u2018faithful Sonship is superior to faithful servantship\u2019. The Son is once again exalted. The exaltation theme finds expression in a more opaque way at 11:26. Here in the famous chapter on faith in which Moses is said to count \u2018abuse suffered for the Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt\u2019. The portrait of Moses drawn here is that of a martyr, and a Christian martyr at that. In effect, Moses joins that great cloud of witnesses who looked to Jesus as pioneer and perfecter of faith. Once again, Christ\u2019s superiority is asserted, this time over Moses and the entire Mosaic epoch.\nIn summary, the writer [of Hebrews] stressed the Sonship of Jesus and expressed it in a three-stage Christology of pre-existence, humanity, and exaltation.\nExternal links.\nOnline translations of the Epistle to the Hebrews:\nRelated articles:"}
{"id": "9902", "revid": "1223123", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9902", "title": "Esther", "text": "Esther is described in all versions of the Book of Esther as the Jewish queen of a Persian king Ahasuerus. In the narrative, Ahasuerus seeks a new wife after his queen, Vashti, refuses to obey him, and Esther is chosen for her beauty. The king's chief adviser, Haman, is offended by Esther's cousin and guardian, Mordecai, and gets permission from the king to have all the Jews in the kingdom killed. Esther foils the plan, and wins permission from the king for the Jews to kill their enemies, and they do so. Her story provides a traditional background for Purim, which is celebrated on the date given in the story for when Haman's order was to go into effect, which is the same day that the Jews killed their enemies after the plan was reversed.\nEtymology.\nIt was a common Jewish practice in antiquity, attested especially in the Book of Daniel (1:7) and I Maccabees (2:2-5), to have not only a Hebrew name but also one redolent of pagan connotations. In the Tanakh Esther is given two names: Hadassah/Esther (2:7). Various hypotheses vie for the etymology of the latter. Hebrew \"hadassah\" is apparently the feminine form of the word for myrtle, a plant associated with hope, though it first appears as a name of Esther.\nEarly rabbinical views varied. According to the Bavli (Megillah 13a), Rabbi Nehemiah thought her second name was a heteronym used by Gentiles, based on \u05d0\u05e1\u05ea\u05d4\u05e8 (\"'\u012bst\u0259h\u0103r\"), the morning star Venus, an association preserved by Yalkut Shimoni (1053:7) and in Targum Sheni. Conversely, Rabbi Jehoshua maintained that Esther was her original name, and that she was called Hadassah (myrtle) in Hebrew because she had an (olive-)green complexion. In modern times, the view of the German Assyriologist Peter Jensen that the theonym for the Babylonian goddess Ishtar lay behind Esther gained a general consensus. He also thought that the Hebrew name was to be linked to an Akkadian word meaning 'bride' (\"\u1e2bada\u0161atu\") which happens to be an epithet often attached to the Babylonian goddess. His other speculation, that \"\u1e2bada\u0161atu\" itself also meant myrtle, has no empirical basis in Akkadian texts.\nAbraham Yahuda conjectured in 1946 that, particularly in light of the Persian setting, the first syllable of 'Esther' (\"es-\") must reflect the Persian word for myrtle, \"\u0101s\" ()), and therefore her name was the Persian equivalent of \"Hadassah\" with both meaning myrtle. This required him to hypothesize that behind \"\u0101s\" lay an earlier old Iranian word, *\"a\u00e7a\" (\"as(s)a)\" meaning 'myrtle', which would be reproduced in a conjectural Medic form *\"astra\", preserved in the Hebrew name \u05d0\u05e1\u05ea\u05e8. His premise assumed that the Semitic word was a loanword from old Persian, a highly improbable assumption since the Semitic word is attested long before contact with Persian-speakers.\nIn 1986 Ran Zadok dismissed the etymological correlation between Babylonian Ishtar and Esther on two grounds. One regards the principles governing phonological shifts in Semitic loanwords. The Hebrew form \" 'str\" in Esther cannot represent Akkadian \"I\u0161tar\" for neo-Akkadian borrowings into Aramaic conserve the original \"\u0161\" rather than altering it to 's', as would be the case here were the two linked. Secondly, Ishtar is a theonym, never an anthroponym unless modified significantly. Zadok then ventured an alternative derivation, suggesting that the only plausible etymology would be from the Old Iranian word for 'star' ( (\"set\u0101re\")), usually transcribed as \"stara\", cognate with Greek (\"ast\u00e9r \" as in 'astronomy'), the word Hellenistic Jews used to interprete her name.\nDavid Testen advanced in 1996 a simpler solution than Yasuda's, by suggesting that as a name 'ester' could be a compound term conflating Semitic \"\u0101s\" with the Old Iranian term for a tree (\" d\u0101\u0301ru./drau\"-) to yield 'myrtle tree').\nIn the Bible.\nIn the narrative, King Ahasuerus is drunk at a celebration of the third year of his reign, and orders his queen, Vashti, to appear before him and his guests wearing the royal crown, to display her beauty. When she refuses to appear, he has her banished and seeks a new queen. Beautiful maidens gather together at the harem in the citadel of Susa under the authority of the eunuch Hegai.\nEsther, cousin of Mordecai, was a member of the Jewish community in the Exilic Period who claimed as an ancestor Kish, a Benjamite who had been taken from Jerusalem into captivity. She was the orphaned daughter of Mordecai's uncle, another Benjamite named Abihail. Upon the king's orders Esther is taken to the palace where Hegai prepares her to meet the king. Even as she advances to the highest position of the harem, perfumed with myrrh and allocated certain foods and servants, she is under strict instructions from Mordecai, who meets with her each day, to conceal her Jewish origins. The king falls in love with her and makes her his Queen.\nFollowing Esther's coronation, Mordecai learns of an assassination plot by Bigthan and Teresh to kill King Ahasuerus. Mordecai tells Esther, who tells the king in the name of Mordecai, and he is saved. This act of great service to the king is recorded in the Annals of the Kingdom.\nAfter Mordecai saves the king's life, Haman the Agagite is made Ahasuerus' highest adviser, and orders that everyone bow down to him. When Mordecai (who had stationed himself in the street to advise Esther) refuses to bow to him, Haman pays King Ahasuerus 10,000 Silver Talents for the right to exterminate all of the Jews in Ahasuerus' kingdom. Haman casts lots, Purim, using supernatural means, and sees that the thirteenth day of the Month of Adar is a fortuitous day for the genocide. Using the seal of the king, in the name of the king, Haman sends an order to the provinces of the kingdom to allow the extermination of the Jews on the thirteenth of Adar. When Mordecai learns of this, he tells Esther to reveal to the king that she is Jewish and ask that he repeal the order. Esther hesitates, saying that she could be put to death if she goes to the king without being summoned; nevertheless, Mordecai urges her to try. Esther asks that the entire Jewish community fast and pray for three days before she goes to see the king; Mordecai agrees.\nOn the third day, Esther goes to the courtyard in front of the king's palace, and she is welcomed by the king, who stretches out his sceptre for her to touch, and offers her anything she wants \"up to half of the kingdom\". Esther invites the king and Haman to a banquet she has prepared for the next day. She tells the king she will reveal her request at the banquet. During the banquet, the king repeats his offer again, whereupon Esther invites both the king and Haman to a banquet she is making on the following day as well.\nSeeing that he is in favor with the king and queen, Haman takes counsel from his wife and friends to build a gallows upon which to hang Mordecai; as he is in their good favours, he believes he will be granted his wish to hang Mordecai the very next day. After building the gallows, Haman goes to the palace in the middle of the night to wait for the earliest moment he can see the king.\nThat evening, the king, unable to sleep, asks that the Annals of the Kingdom be read to him so that he will become drowsy. The book miraculously opens to the page telling of Mordecai's great service, and the king asks if he had already received a reward. When his attendants answer in the negative, Ahasuerus is suddenly distracted, and demands to know who is standing in the palace courtyard in the middle of the night. The attendants answer that it is Haman. Ahasuerus invites Haman into his room. Haman, instead of requesting that Mordecai be hanged, is ordered to take Mordecai through the streets of the capital on the Royal Horse wearing the Royal Robes. Haman is also instructed to yell, \"This is what shall be done to the man whom the king wishes to honour!\"\nAfter spending the entire day honoring Mordecai, Haman rushes to Esther's second banquet, where Ahasuerus is already waiting. Ahasuerus repeats his offer to Esther of anything \"up to half of the kingdom\". Esther tells Ahasuerus that while she appreciates the offer, she must put before him a more basic issue: she explains that there is a person plotting to kill her and her entire people, and that this person's intentions are to harm the king and the kingdom. When Ahasuerus asks who this person is, Esther points to Haman and names him. Upon hearing this, an enraged Ahasuerus goes out to the garden to calm down and consider the situation.\nWhile Ahasuerus is in the garden, Haman throws himself at Esther's feet asking for mercy. Upon returning from the garden, the king is further enraged. As it was the custom to eat on reclining couches, it appears to the king as if Haman is attacking Esther. He orders Haman to be removed from his sight. While Haman is being led out, Harvona, a civil servant, tells the king that Haman had built a gallows for Mordecai, \"who had saved the king's life\". In response, the king says \"Hang him (Haman) on it\".\nAfter Haman is put to death, Ahasuerus gives Haman's estate to Esther. Esther tells the king about Mordecai being her relative, and the king makes Mordecai his adviser. When Esther asks the king to revoke the order exterminating the Jews, the king is initially hesitant, saying that an order issued by the king cannot be repealed. Ahasuerus allows Esther and Mordecai to draft another order, with the seal of the king and in the name of the king, to allow the Jewish people to defend themselves and fight with their oppressors on the thirteenth day of Adar.\nOn the thirteenth day of Adar, the same day that Haman had set for them to be killed, the Jews defend themselves in all parts of the kingdom and rest on the fourteenth day of Adar. The fourteenth day of Adar is celebrated with the giving of charity, exchanging foodstuffs, and feasting. In Susa, the Jews of the capital were given another day to kill their oppressors; they rested and celebrated on the fifteenth day of Adar, again giving charity, exchanging foodstuffs, and feasting as well.\nPurim.\nThe Jews established an annual feast, the feast of Purim, in memory of their deliverance. Haman having set the date of the thirteenth of Adar to commence his campaign against the Jews, this determined the date of the festival of Purim.\nHistoricity.\nBecause the text lacks any references to known events, some historians believe that the narrative of \"Esther\" is fictional, and the name Ahasuerus is used to refer to a fictionalized Xerxes I, in order to provide an aetiology for Purim. Some historians additionally argue that, because the Persian kings did not marry outside of seven Persian noble families, it is unlikely that there was a Jewish queen Esther and that in any case the historical Xerxes's queen was Amestris. However, Amestris herself did not descend from these families, and Darius I is also said to have married a woman who did not belong to them. \nThat said, many Jews and Christians believe the story to be a true historical event, especially Persian Jews who have a close relationship to Esther and there are some that say there is evidence of her cousin Mordecai. In 1904, a tablet was discovered in Persepolis, another Persian royal city, stating the name Marduka who was a Persian officials during King Xerxes\u2019 early reign. Scholars consider the name Marduka to be identical to the name Mordecai.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Howard Jr., [An Introduction to the Old Testament Historical Books] Moody Publishers 2007 "}

He referred to the amoeba he observed microscopically as \"Amoeba coli\"; however, it is not clear whether he was using this as a descriptive term or intended it as a formal taxonomic name. The genus \"Entamoeba\" was defined by Casagrandi and Barbagallo for the species \"Entamoeba coli\", which is known to be a commensal organism. L\u00f6sch's organism was renamed \"Entamoeba histolytica\" by Fritz Schaudinn in 1903; he later died, in 1906, from a self-inflicted infection when studying this amoeba. For a time during the first half of the 20th century the entire genus \"Entamoeba\" was transferred to \"Endamoeba\", a genus of amoebas infecting invertebrates about which little is known. This move was reversed by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature in the late 1950s, and \"Entamoeba\" has stayed 'stable' ever since.\nSpecies.\nSeveral species are found in humans and animals. \"Entamoeba histolytica\" is the pathogen responsible for invasive 'amoebiasis' (which includes amoebic dysentery and amoebic liver abscesses). Others such as \"Entamoeba coli\" (not to be confused with \"Escherichia coli\") and \"Entamoeba dispar\" are harmless. With the exception of \"Entamoeba gingivalis\", which lives in the mouth, and \"E. moshkovskii\", which is frequently isolated from river and lake sediments, all \"Entamoeba\" species are found in the intestines of the animals they infect. \"Entamoeba invadens\" is a species that can cause a disease similar to \"E. histolytica\" but in reptiles. In contrast to other species, \"E. invadens\" forms cysts in vitro in the absence of bacteria and is used as a model system to study this aspect of the life cycle. Many other species of \"Entamoeba\" have been described, and it is likely that many others remain to be found.\nStructure.\n\"Entamoeba\" cells are small, with a single nucleus and typically a single lobose pseudopod taking the form of a clear anterior bulge. They have a simple life cycle. The trophozoite (feeding-dividing form) is approximately 10-20 \u03bcm in diameter and feeds primarily on bacteria. It divides by simple binary fission to form two smaller daughter cells. Almost all species form cysts, the stage involved in transmission (the exception is \"Entamoeba gingivalis\"). Depending on the species, these can have one, four or eight nuclei and are variable in size; these characteristics help in species identification.\nClassification.\n\"Entamoeba\" belongs to the Archamoebae, which like many other anaerobic eukaryotes have reduced mitochondria. This group also includes \"Endolimax\" and \"Iodamoeba\", which also live in animal intestines and are similar in appearance to \"Entamoeba\", although this may partly be due to convergence. Also in this group are the free-living amoebo-flagellates of the genus \"Mastigamoeba\" and related genera. Certain other genera of symbiotic amoebae, such as \"Endamoeba\", might prove to be synonyms of \"Entamoeba\" but this is still unclear.\nCulture.\nFission.\nStudying \"Entamoeba invadens\", David Biron of the Weizmann Institute of Science and coworkers found that about one third of the cells are unable to separate unaided and recruit a neighboring amoeba (dubbed the \"midwife\") to complete the fission. He writes:\nThey also reported a similar behavior in \"Dictyostelium\".\nSince \"E. histolytica\" does not form cysts in the absence of bacteria, \"E. invadens\" has become used as a model for encystation studies as it will form cysts under axenic growth conditions, which simplifies analysis. After inducing encystation in \"E. invadens\", DNA replication increases initially and then slows down. On completion of encystation, predominantly tetra-nucleate cysts are formed along with some uni-, bi- and tri-nucleate cysts.\nDifferentiation and cell biology.\nUninucleated trophozoites convert into cysts in a process called encystation. The number of nuclei in the cyst varies from 1 to 8 among species and is one of the characteristics used to tell species apart. Of the species already mentioned, \"Entamoeba coli\" forms cysts with 8 nuclei while the others form tetra-nucleated cysts. Since \"E. histolytica\" does not form cysts \"in vitro\" in the absence of bacteria, it is not possible to study the differentiation process in detail in that species. Instead the differentiation process is studied using \"E. invadens\", a reptilian parasite that causes a very similar disease to \"E. histolytica\" and which can be induced to encyst \"in vitro\". Until recently there was no genetic transfection vector available for this organism and detailed study at the cellular level was not possible. However, recently a transfection vector was developed and the transfection conditions for \"E. invadens\" were optimised which should enhance the research possibilities at the molecular level of the differentiation process.\nMeiosis.\nIn sexually reproducing eukaryotes, homologous recombination (HR) ordinarily occurs during meiosis. The meiosis-specific recombinase, Dmc1, is required for efficient meiotic HR, and Dmc1 is expressed in \"E. histolytica\". The purified Dmc1 from \"E. histolytica\" forms presynaptic filaments and catalyzes ATP-dependent homologous DNA pairing and DNA strand exchange over at least several thousand base pairs. The DNA pairing and strand exchange reactions are enhanced by the eukaryotic meiosis-specific recombination accessory factor (heterodimer) Hop2-Mnd1. These processes are central to meiotic recombination, suggesting that \"E. histolytica\" undergoes meiosis.\nStudies of \"E. invadens\" found that, during the conversion from the tetraploid uninucleate trophozoite to the tetranucleate cyst, homologous recombination is enhanced. Expression of genes with functions related to the major steps of meiotic recombination also increased during encystations. These findings in \"E. invadens\", combined with evidence from studies of \"E. histolytica\" indicate the presence of meiosis in the \"Entamoeba\"."}

It is controlled by The Football Association (FA), the governing body for football in England, which is affiliated with UEFA and comes under the global jurisdiction of world football's governing body FIFA. Also known as \"The Three Lions\", England competes in the three major international tournaments contested by European nations; the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA European Championship and the UEFA Nations League. England is one of only eight nations to have been crowned world champions, having won the 1966 World Cup.\nEngland is the joint oldest national team in football. They played in the world's first international football match in 1872, against Scotland. England's home ground is Wembley Stadium, London, and their training headquarters is at St George's Park, Burton upon Trent. The team's manager is Gareth Southgate.\nSince first entering the tournament in 1950, England has qualified for the FIFA World Cup 15 times. They won the 1966 World Cup, when they also hosted the finals, and finished fourth in both 1990 and 2018. Since first entering in 1964, England has never won the UEFA European Championship, with their best performances being third-place finishes in 1968 and 1996, the latter as hosts. England, as a constituent country of the United Kingdom, is not a member of the International Olympic Committee and therefore the national team does not compete at the Olympic Games.\nHistory.\nEarly years.\nThe England national football team is the joint-oldest in the world; it was formed at the same time as Scotland. A representative match between England and Scotland was played on 5 March 1870, having been organised by the Football Association. A return fixture was organised by representatives of Scottish football teams on 30 November 1872. This match, played at Hamilton Crescent in Scotland, is viewed as the first official international football match, because the two teams were independently selected and operated, rather than being the work of a single football association. Over the next 40 years, England played exclusively with the other three Home Nations\u2014Scotland, Wales and Ireland\u2014in the British Home Championship.\nAt first, England had no permanent home stadium. They joined FIFA in 1906 and played their first games against countries other than the Home Nations on a tour of Central Europe in 1908. Wembley Stadium was opened in 1923 and became their home ground. The relationship between England and FIFA became strained, and this resulted in their departure from FIFA in 1928, before they rejoined in 1946. As a result, they did not compete in a World Cup until 1950, in which they were beaten in a 1\u20130 defeat by the United States, failing to get past the first round in one of the most embarrassing defeats in the team's history.\nTheir first defeat on home soil to a foreign team was a 2\u20130 loss to Ireland, on 21 September 1949 at Goodison Park. A 6\u20133 loss in 1953 to Hungary, was their second defeat by a foreign team at Wembley. In the return match in Budapest, Hungary won 7\u20131. This stands as England's largest ever defeat. After the game, a bewildered Syd Owen said, \"it was like playing men from outer space\". In the 1954 FIFA World Cup, England reached the quarter-finals for the first time, and lost 4\u20132 to reigning champions Uruguay.\nWalter Winterbottom and Alf Ramsey.\nAlthough Walter Winterbottom was appointed as England's first full-time manager in 1946, the team was still picked by a committee until Alf Ramsey took over in 1963. The 1966 FIFA World Cup was hosted in England and Ramsey guided England to victory with a 4\u20132 win against West Germany after extra time in the final, during which Geoff Hurst scored a hat-trick. In UEFA Euro 1968, the team reached the semi-finals for the first time, being eliminated by Yugoslavia.\nEngland qualified automatically for the 1970 FIFA World Cup in Mexico as reigning champions, and reached the quarter-finals, where they were knocked out by West Germany. England had been 2\u20130 up, but were eventually beaten 3\u20132 after extra time. They then failed to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, leading to Ramsey's dismissal by the F.A.\nDon Revie, Ron Greenwood and Bobby Robson.\nFollowing Ramsey's dismissal, Joe Mercer took immediate temporary charge of England for a seven-match spell until Don Revie was appointed as new permanent manager in 1974. Under Revie, the team underperformed and failed to qualify for either UEFA Euro 1976 or the 1978 FIFA World Cup. Revie resigned in 1977 and was replaced by Ron Greenwood, under whom performances improved and the team managed to qualify for the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain (the first time competitive tournament qualification achieved since 1962); however, despite not losing a game, they were eliminated at the second group stage.\nBobby Robson managed England from 1982 to 1990. Although the team failed to qualify for UEFA Euro 1984, they reached the quarter-finals of the 1986 FIFA World Cup, losing 2\u20131 to Argentina in a game made famous by two highly contrasting goals scored by Maradona - the first being blatantly knocked in by his hand, prompting his \"Hand of God\" remark, the second being an outstandingly skilful individual goal, involving high speed dribbling past several opponents. England striker Gary Lineker finished as the tournament's top scorer with six goals.\nEngland went on to lose every match at UEFA Euro 1988. They next achieved their second best result in the 1990 FIFA World Cup by finishing fourth\u00a0\u2013 losing again to West Germany after a closely contested semi-final finishing 1\u20131 after extra time, then 3\u20134 in England's first penalty shoot-out. Despite losing to Italy in the third place play-off, the members of the England team were given bronze medals identical to the Italians'. Due to the team's good performance at the tournament against general expectations, and the emotional nature of the narrow defeat to West Germany, the team were welcomed home as heroes and thousands of people lined the streets for an open-top bus parade.\nGraham Taylor, Terry Venables, Glenn Hoddle and Kevin Keegan.\nThe 1990s saw four England managers follow Robson, each in the role for a relatively brief period. Graham Taylor was Robson's immediate successor. England failed to win any matches at UEFA Euro 1992, drawing with tournament winners Denmark and later with France, before being eliminated by host nation Sweden. The team then failed to qualify for the 1994 FIFA World Cup after losing a controversial game against the Netherlands in Rotterdam, which resulted in Taylor's resignation amid much newspaper criticism of his tactics.\nBetween 1994 and 1996, Terry Venables managed the team. At UEFA Euro 1996, held in England, they equalled their best performance at a European Championship, reaching the semi-finals as they did in 1968, before exiting via another penalty shoot-out loss to Germany. England striker Alan Shearer was the tournament's top scorer with five goals. Venables resigned following investigations into his personal financial activities.\nVenables' successor, Glenn Hoddle, similarly left the job for non-footballing reasons after coaching the team in the 1998 FIFA World Cup\u00a0\u2014 in which England were eliminated in the second round again by Argentina and again on penalties (after a 2\u20132 draw). Following Hoddle's departure, Howard Wilkinson took over as caretaker manager for two matches. Kevin Keegan was then appointed as new permanent manager and took England to UEFA Euro 2000, but the team exited in the group stage and he unexpectedly resigned shortly afterwards.\nSven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson, Steve McClaren and Fabio Capello.\nPeter Taylor was appointed as caretaker manager for one match, before Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson took charge between 2001 and 2006, and was the team's first non-English manager. He guided England to the quarter-finals of the 2002 FIFA World Cup, UEFA Euro 2004 and the 2006 FIFA World Cup. England lost only five competitive matches during his entire tenure, and rose to number four in the world ranking under his guidance. Eriksson's contract was extended by the FA by two years, to include UEFA Euro 2008, but was terminated by them after the 2006 World Cup.\nSteve McClaren was then appointed as manager, but after failing to qualify for Euro 2008 he was sacked on 22 November 2007 after 18 matches in charge. The following month, he was replaced by a second foreign manager, Italian Fabio Capello, whose previous experience included successful spells at Juventus and Real Madrid. England won all but one of their qualifying games for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, but at the tournament itself, England drew their opening two games; this led to questions about the team's spirit, tactics and ability to handle pressure. They progressed to the next round, however, where they were beaten 4\u20131 by Germany, their heaviest defeat in a World Cup finals tournament match. In February 2012, Capello resigned from his role as England manager, following a disagreement with the FA over their request to remove John Terry from team captaincy after accusations of racial abuse concerning the player.\nRoy Hodgson, Sam Allardyce and Gareth Southgate.\nFollowing Capello's departure, Stuart Pearce was appointed as caretaker manager for one match, after which in May 2012, Roy Hodgson was announced as the new manager, just six weeks before UEFA Euro 2012. England managed to finish top of their group, but exited the Championships in the quarter-finals via a penalty shoot-out, against Italy. In the 2014 FIFA World Cup, England were eliminated at the group stage for the first time since the 1958 World Cup, and the first time at a major tournament since Euro 2000. England qualified unbeaten for UEFA Euro 2016, but were ultimately eliminated in the Round of 16, losing 2\u20131 to Iceland. Hodgson resigned as manager June 2016, and just under a month later was replaced by Sam Allardyce. However, after only 67 days in charge, Allardyce resigned from his managerial post by mutual agreement, after an alleged breach of FA rules, making him the shortest serving permanent England manager. Allardyce's sole match as England manager was a 1\u20130 victory over Slovakia, however this also makes him the only permanent England manager ever to leave with a 100% win rate.\nGareth Southgate, then the coach of the England under-21 team, was put in temporary charge of the national team until November 2016, before being given the position on a permanent basis. Under Southgate, England qualified comfortably for the 2018 FIFA World Cup and came second in their group at the tournament. They defeated Colombia on penalties in the first knock-out round, and then beat Sweden 2\u20130 in the quarter-final to reach only their third World Cup semi-final. In the semi-final, they were beaten 2\u20131 in extra time by Croatia and then were beaten by Belgium for a second time, 2\u20130, in the third place match. England striker Harry Kane finished the tournament as top scorer with six goals.\nOn 14 November 2019, England played their 1000th International match, defeating Montenegro 7\u20130 at Wembley in a UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying match.\nTeam image.\nColours.\nEngland's traditional home colours are white shirts, navy blue shorts and white or black socks. The team has periodically worn an all-white kit.\nAlthough England's first away kits were blue, England's traditional away colours are red shirts, white shorts and red socks. In 1996, England's away kit was changed to grey shirts, shorts and socks. This kit was only worn three times, including against Germany in the semi-final of Euro 1996 but the deviation from the traditional red was unpopular with supporters and the England away kit remained red until 2011, when a navy blue away kit was introduced. The away kit is also sometimes worn during home matches, when a new edition has been released to promote it.\nEngland have occasionally had a third kit. At the 1970 World Cup England wore a third kit with pale blue shirts, shorts and socks against Czechoslovakia. They had a kit similar to Brazil's, with yellow shirts, yellow socks and blue shorts which they wore in the summer of 1973. For the World Cup in 1986 England had a third kit of pale blue, imitating that worn in Mexico 16 years before and England retained pale blue third kits until 1992, but they were rarely used.\nUmbro first agreed to manufacture the kit in 1954 and since then has supplied most of the kits, the exceptions being from 1959 to 1965 with Bukta and 1974\u20131984 with Admiral. Nike purchased Umbro in 2008 and took over as kit supplier in 2013 following their sale of the Umbro brand.\nCrest.\nThe motif of the England national football team has three lions \"passant guardant\", the emblem of King Richard I, who reigned from 1189 to 1199. In 1872, English players wore white jerseys emblazoned with the three lions crest of the Football Association. The lions, often blue, have had minor changes to colour and appearance. Initially topped by a crown, this was removed in 1949 when the FA was given an official coat of arms by the College of Arms; this introduced ten Tudor roses, one for each of the regional branches of the FA. Since 2003, England top their logo with a star to recognise their World Cup win in 1966; this was first embroidered onto the left sleeve of the home kit, and a year later was moved to its current position, first on the away shirt.\nHome stadium.\nFor the first 50 years of their existence, England played their home matches all around the country. They initially used cricket grounds before later moving on to football club stadiums. The original Empire Stadium was built in Wembley, London, for the British Empire Exhibition.\nEngland played their first match at the stadium in 1924 against Scotland and for the next 27 years Wembley was used as a venue for matches against Scotland only. The stadium later became known simply as Wembley Stadium and it became England's permanent home stadium during the 1950s. In October 2000, the stadium closed its doors, ending with a defeat.\nThis stadium was demolished during the period of 2002\u20132003, and work began to completely rebuild it. During this time, England played at venues across the country, though by the time of the 2006 World Cup qualification, this had largely settled down to having Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium as the primary venue, with Newcastle United's St. James' Park used on occasions when Old Trafford was unavailable.\nThey returned to the new Wembley Stadium in March 2007. The stadium is now owned by the Football Association, via its subsidiary Wembley National Stadium Limited.\nMedia coverage.\nAll England matches are broadcast with full commentary on talkSPORT and BBC Radio 5 Live. From the 2008\u201309 season until the 2017\u201318 season, England's home and away qualifiers, and friendlies both home and away were broadcast live on ITV Sport (often with the exception of STV, the ITV franchisee in central and northern Scotland). England's away qualifiers for the 2010 World Cup were shown on Setanta Sports until that company's collapse. As a result of Setanta Sports's demise, England's World Cup qualifier in Ukraine on 10 October 2009 was shown in the United Kingdom on a pay-per-view basis via the internet only. This one-off event was the first time an England game had been screened in such a way. The number of subscribers, paying between \u00a34.99 and \u00a311.99 each, was estimated at between 250,000 and 300,000 and the total number of viewers at around 500,000. In 2018, Sky Sports broadcast the England Nations League and in-season friendlies, until 2021 and ITV Sport broadcast the European Qualifiers for Euro-World Cups and pre-tournament friendlies (after the Nations League group matches end), until 2022.\nPlayers.\nCurrent squad.\nThe following 24 players were named to the squad for the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification fixtures against San Marino, Albania and Poland on 25, 28 and 31 March 2021.\n\"Caps and goals are correct as of 31 March 2021 after the match against Poland.\"\nRecent call-ups.\nThe following players have also been called up to the England squad within the last twelve months.\nINJ Withdrew due to injury\nPRE Preliminary squad / standby\nRET Retired from the national team\nSUS Serving suspension\nWD Player withdrew from the squad due to non-injury issue.\nResults and fixtures.\nThe following is a list of match results in the last 12 months, as well as any future matches that have been scheduled.\n2021.\n\u00b0 On 17 March 2020, UEFA announced that UEFA Euro 2020 would be postponed by twelve months with proposed new dates 11 June to 11 July 2021.\nPlayer records.\nMost capped players.\nPlayers with an equal number of caps are ranked in chronological order of reaching the milestone.\nCompetitive record.\n\"For the all-time record of the national team against opposing nations, see the team's all-time record page\"\nFIFA World Cup.\nEngland first appeared at the 1950 FIFA World Cup, and have subsequently qualified for a total of 15 FIFA World Cup finals tournaments, tied for sixth best by number of appearances. They are also tied for sixth by number of wins, alongside Spain. The national team is one of eight national teams to have won at least one FIFA World Cup title. The England team won their first and only World Cup title in 1966. The tournament was played on home soil, and England defeated West Germany 4\u20132 in the final. In 1990, England finished in fourth place, losing 2\u20131 to host nation Italy in the third place play-off, after losing on penalties to champions West Germany in the semi-final. They also finished in fourth place in 2018, after losing 2\u20130 to Belgium in the third place play-off and 2\u20131 to Croatia in the semi-final after extra time. The team also reached the quarter-final stage in 1954, 1962, 1970, 1986, 2002 and 2006.\nEngland failed to qualify for the World Cup in 1974, 1978 and 1994. The team's earliest exit in the finals tournament was its elimination in the first round in 1950, 1958 and, most recently, the 2014 FIFA World Cup. This was after being defeated in both their opening two matches for the first time, against Italy and Uruguay in Group D. In 1950, four teams remained after the first round, in 1958 eight teams remained and in 2014 sixteen teams remained. In 2010, England suffered its most resounding World Cup defeat, 4\u20131 to Germany, in the Round of 16 stage. This came after drawing with the United States and Algeria, and defeating Slovenia 1\u20130 in the group stage.\nUEFA European Championship.\nEngland's greatest achievements at the UEFA European Championship have been to finish in third place, in 1968 and 1996. England hosted Euro 96, and have qualified for ten UEFA European Championship finals tournaments, tied for fourth best by number of appearances. The team has also reached the quarter-final on two recent occasions, in 2004 and 2012.\nThe team's worst result in the competition was a first-round elimination in 1980, 1988, 1992 and 2000. The team did not enter in 1960, and failed to qualify for the finals in 1964, 1972, 1976, 1984 and 2008.\nFIFA Rankings.\n\"Last update was on 21 December 2020.\" \nSource:\n Best Ranking\u00a0\u00a0 Worst Ranking\u00a0\u00a0 Best Mover\u00a0\u00a0 Worst Mover\u00a0\u00a0\nHonours.\nMajor:\nRegional:\nOther:\nExhibition Tournaments:"}

It is in the extreme southwest of the Greater St. Louis metro area. As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 10,189. Since 1971, Eureka has been known as the home of the amusement park Six Flags St. Louis.\nHistory.\nThe village of Eureka was platted in 1858 along the route of the Pacific Railroad. By 1890, the village consisted of about 100 homes. According to the Eureka, railroad workers, while clearing the way for the track and the next railroad camp, saw Eureka, level land with little to clear, and declared, \"Eureka!\" Greek meaning \"I have found it.\" Thus, Eureka was founded. In 1898, Eureka became home to the St. Louis Children's Industrial Farm, established to give children from St. Louis tenement neighborhoods a chance to experience life in a rural setting. It later became Camp Wyman (now part of Wyman Center) and is one of the oldest camps in the United States. Eureka was incorporated as a fourth-class city on April 7, 1954.\nCity of Allenton.\nThe railroad town of Allenton is a former community on U.S. Route 66 located (now) at the junction of Interstate 44 and Business Loop 44 in western St. Louis County. In 1985, it was annexed by the city of Eureka. The town is currently rural, with adjacent farmland and forested Ozark ridges. This community was declared blighted by St. Louis County in 1973.\nGeography.\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land, and is water.\nDemographics.\n2010 census.\nAs of the 2010 census, there were 10,189 people, 3,474 households, and 2,758 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 3,683 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 94.9% White, 0.8% African American, 0.2% Native American, 1.9% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 0.3% from other races, and 1.7% from two or more races.

Equations of state are useful in describing the properties of fluids, mixtures of fluids, solids, and the interior of stars.\nOverview.\nAt present, there is no single equation of state that accurately predicts the properties of all substances under all conditions. An example of an equation of state correlates densities of gases and liquids to temperatures and pressures, known as the ideal gas law, which is roughly accurate for weakly polar gases at low pressures and moderate temperatures. This equation becomes increasingly inaccurate at higher pressures and lower temperatures, and fails to predict condensation from a gas to a liquid.\nAnother common use is in modeling the interior of stars, including neutron stars, dense matter (quark\u2013gluon plasmas) and radiation fields. A related concept is the perfect fluid equation of state used in cosmology.\nEquations of state can also describe solids, including the transition of solids from one crystalline state to another.\nIn a practical context, equations of state are instrumental for PVT calculations in process engineering problems, such as petroleum gas/liquid equilibrium calculations. A successful PVT model based on a fitted equation of state can be helpful to determine the state of the flow regime, the parameters for handling the reservoir fluids, and pipe sizing.\nMeasurements of equation-of-state parameters, especially at high pressures, can be made using lasers.\nHistorical.\nBoyle's law (1662).\nBoyle's Law was perhaps the first expression of an equation of state. In 1662, the Irish physicist and chemist Robert Boyle performed a series of experiments employing a J-shaped glass tube, which was sealed on one end. Mercury was added to the tube, trapping a fixed quantity of air in the short, sealed end of the tube. Then the volume of gas was measured as additional mercury was added to the tube. The pressure of the gas could be determined by the difference between the mercury level in the short end of the tube and that in the long, open end. Through these experiments, Boyle noted that the gas volume varied inversely with the pressure. In mathematical form, this can be stated as:\nThe above relationship has also been attributed to Edme Mariotte and is sometimes referred to as Mariotte's law. However, Mariotte's work was not published until 1676.\nCharles's law or Law of Charles and Gay-Lussac (1787).\nIn 1787 the French physicist Jacques Charles found that oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, and air expand to roughly the same extent over the same 80-kelvin interval. Later, in 1802, Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac published results of similar experiments, indicating a linear relationship between volume and temperature (Charles's Law):\nDalton's law of partial pressures (1801).\nDalton's Law of partial pressure states that the pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the pressures of all of the constituent gases alone.\nMathematically, this can be represented for \"n\" species as:\nThe ideal gas law (1834).\nIn 1834, \u00c9mile Clapeyron combined Boyle's Law and Charles' law into the first statement of the \"ideal gas law\". Initially, the law was formulated as \"pVm\" = \"R\"(\"TC\" + 267) (with temperature expressed in degrees Celsius), where \"R\" is the gas constant. However, later work revealed that the number should actually be closer to 273.2, and then the Celsius scale was defined with 0\u00b0C = 273.15K, giving:\nVan der Waals equation of state (1873).\nIn 1873, J. D. van der Waals introduced the first equation of state derived by the assumption of a finite volume occupied by the constituent molecules. His new formula revolutionized the study of equations of state, and was most famously continued via the Redlich\u2013Kwong equation of state and the Soave modification of Redlich-Kwong.\nGeneral form of an equation of state.\nFor a given amount of substance contained in a system, the temperature, volume, and pressure are not independent quantities; they are connected by a relationship of the general form\nAn equation used to model this relationship is called an equation of state. In the following sections major equations of state are described, and the variables used here are defined as follows. Any consistent set of units may be used, although SI units are preferred. Absolute temperature refers to use of the Kelvin (K) or Rankine (\u00b0R) temperature scales, with zero being absolute zero.\nClassical ideal gas law.\nThe classical ideal gas law may be written\nIn the form shown above, the equation of state is thus\nIf the calorically perfect gas approximation is used, then the ideal gas law may also be expressed as follows\nwhere formula_19 is the density, formula_20 is the adiabatic index (ratio of specific heats), formula_21 is the internal energy per unit mass (the \"specific internal energy\"), formula_22 is the specific heat at constant volume, and formula_23 is the specific heat at constant pressure.\nQuantum ideal gas law.\nSince for atomic and molecular gases, the classical ideal gas law is well suited in most cases, let us describe the equation of state for elementary particles with mass formula_24 and spin formula_25 that takes into account of quantum effects. In the following, the upper sign will always correspond to Fermi-Dirac statistics and the lower sign to Bose\u2013Einstein statistics. The equation of state of such gases with formula_26 particles occupying a volume formula_27 with temperature formula_28 and pressure formula_29 is given by\nwhere formula_31 is the Boltzmann constant and formula_32 the chemical potential is given by the following implicit function\nIn the limiting case where formula_34, this equation of state will reduce to that of the classical ideal gas. It can be shown that the above equation of state in the limit formula_34 reduces to\nWith a fixed number density formula_37, decreasing the temperature causes in Fermi gas, a increase in the value for pressure from its classical value implying an effective repulsion between particles (this is an apparent repulsion due to quantum exchange effects not because of actual interactions between particles since in ideal gas, interactional forces are neglected) and in Bose gas, a decrease in pressure from its classical value implying an effective attraction.\nCubic equations of state.\nCubic equations of state are called such because they can be rewritten as a cubic function of formula_38.\nVan der Waals equation of state.\nThe Van der Waals equation of state may be written:\nwhere formula_38 is molar volume. The substance-specific constants formula_41 and formula_42 can be calculated from the critical properties formula_43, formula_44, and formula_45 (noting that formula_45 is the molar volume at the critical point) as:\nAlso written as\nProposed in 1873, the van der Waals equation of state was one of the first to perform markedly better than the ideal gas law. In this landmark equation formula_41 is called the attraction parameter and formula_42 the repulsion parameter or the effective molecular volume. While the equation is definitely superior to the ideal gas law and does predict the formation of a liquid phase, the agreement with experimental data is limited for conditions where the liquid forms. While the van der Waals equation is commonly referenced in text-books and papers for historical reasons, it is now obsolete. Other modern equations of only slightly greater complexity are much more accurate.\nThe van der Waals equation may be considered as the ideal gas law, \"improved\" due to two independent reasons:\nWith the reduced state variables, i.e. formula_61, formula_62 and formula_63, the reduced form of the Van der Waals equation can be formulated:\nThe benefit of this form is that for given formula_65 and formula_66, the reduced volume of the liquid and gas can be calculated directly using Cardano's method for the reduced cubic form:\nFor formula_68 and formula_69, the system is in a state of vapor\u2013liquid equilibrium. The reduced cubic equation of state yields in that case 3 solutions. The largest and the lowest solution are the gas and liquid reduced volume.\nRedlich-Kwong equation of state.\nIntroduced in 1949, the Redlich-Kwong equation of state was a considerable improvement over other equations of the time. It is still of interest primarily due to its relatively simple form. While superior to the van der Waals equation of state, it performs poorly with respect to the liquid phase and thus cannot be used for accurately calculating vapor\u2013liquid equilibria. However, it can be used in conjunction with separate liquid-phase correlations for this purpose.\nThe Redlich-Kwong equation is adequate for calculation of gas phase properties when the ratio of the pressure to the critical pressure (reduced pressure) is less than about one-half of the ratio of the temperature to the critical temperature (reduced temperature):\nSoave modification of Redlich-Kwong.\nWhere \"\u03c9\" is the acentric factor for the species.\nThis formulation for formula_77 is due to Graboski and Daubert. The original formulation from Soave is:\nfor hydrogen:\nWe can also write it in the polynomial form, with:\nthen we have:\nwhere formula_83 is the universal gas constant and \"Z\"=\"PV\"/(\"RT\") is the compressibility factor.\nIn 1972 G. Soave replaced the 1/ term of the Redlich-Kwong equation with a function \"\u03b1\"(\"T\",\"\u03c9\") involving the temperature and the acentric factor (the resulting equation is also known as the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state; SRK EOS). The \"\u03b1\" function was devised to fit the vapor pressure data of hydrocarbons and the equation does fairly well for these materials.\nNote especially that this replacement changes the definition of \"a\" slightly, as the formula_44 is now to the second power.\nVolume translation of Peneloux et al. (1982).\nThe SRK EOS may be written as\nwhere\nwhere formula_77 and other parts of the SRK EOS is defined in the SRK EOS section.\nA downside of the SRK EOS, and other cubic EOS, is that the liquid molar volume is significantly less accurate than the gas molar volume. Peneloux et alios (1982) proposed a simple correction for this by introducing a volume translation\nwhere formula_89 is an additional fluid component parameter that translates the molar volume slightly. On the liquid branch of the EOS, a small change in molar volume corresponds to a large change in pressure. On the gas branch of the EOS, a small change in molar volume corresponds to a much smaller change in pressure than for the liquid branch. Thus, the perturbation of the molar gas volume is small. Unfortunately, there are two versions that occur in science and industry.\nIn the first version only formula_90 is translated,\n and the EOS becomes\nIn the second version both formula_90 and formula_93 are translated, or the translation of formula_90 is followed by a renaming of the composite parameter . This gives\nThe c-parameter of a fluid mixture is calculated by\nThe c-parameter of the individual fluid components in a petroleum gas and oil can be estimated by the correlation\nwhere the Rackett compressibility factor formula_98 can be estimated by\nA nice feature with the volume translation method of Peneloux et al. (1982) is that it does not affect the vapor-liquid equilibrium calculations. This method of volume translation can also be applied to other cubic EOSs if the c-parameter correlation is adjusted to match the selected EOS.\nPeng\u2013Robinson equation of state.\nIn polynomial form:\nwhere formula_104 is the acentric factor of the species, formula_83 is the universal gas constant and formula_106 is compressibility factor.\nThe Peng\u2013Robinson equation of state (PR EOS) was developed in 1976 at The University of Alberta by Ding-Yu Peng and Donald Robinson in order to satisfy the following goals:\nFor the most part the Peng\u2013Robinson equation exhibits performance similar to the Soave equation, although it is generally superior in predicting the liquid densities of many materials, especially nonpolar ones. The departure functions of the Peng\u2013Robinson equation are given on a separate article.\nThe analytic values of its characteristic constants are:\nPeng\u2013Robinson-Stryjek-Vera equations of state.\nPRSV1.\nA modification to the attraction term in the Peng\u2013Robinson equation of state published by Stryjek and Vera in 1986 (PRSV) significantly improved the model's accuracy by introducing an adjustable pure component parameter and by modifying the polynomial fit of the acentric factor.\nThe modification is:\nwhere formula_111 is an adjustable pure component parameter. Stryjek and Vera published pure component parameters for many compounds of industrial interest in their original journal article. At reduced temperatures above 0.7, they recommend to set formula_112 and simply use formula_113. For alcohols and water the value of formula_114 may be used up to the critical temperature and set to zero at higher temperatures.\nPRSV2.\nA subsequent modification published in 1986 (PRSV2) further improved the model's accuracy by introducing two additional pure component parameters to the previous attraction term modification.\nThe modification is:\nwhere formula_111, formula_117, and formula_118 are adjustable pure component parameters.\nPRSV2 is particularly advantageous for VLE calculations. While PRSV1 does offer an advantage over the Peng\u2013Robinson model for describing thermodynamic behavior, it is still not accurate enough, in general, for phase equilibrium calculations. The highly non-linear behavior of phase-equilibrium calculation methods tends to amplify what would otherwise be acceptably small errors. It is therefore recommended that PRSV2 be used for equilibrium calculations when applying these models to a design. However, once the equilibrium state has been determined, the phase specific thermodynamic values at equilibrium may be determined by one of several simpler models with a reasonable degree of accuracy.\nOne thing to note is that in the PRSV equation, the parameter fit is done in a particular temperature range which is usually below the critical temperature. Above the critical temperature, the PRSV alpha function tends to diverge and become arbitrarily large instead of tending towards 0. Because of this, alternate equations for alpha should be employed above the critical point. This is especially important for systems containing hydrogen which is often found at temperatures far above its critical point. Several alternate formulations have been proposed. Some well known ones are by Twu et al or by Mathias and Copeman.\nPeng-Robinson-Babalola equation of state (PRB).\nBabalola modified the Peng\u2013Robinson Equation of state as:\nformula_119\nThe attractive force parameter \u2018a\u2019, which was considered to be a constant with respect to pressure in Peng\u2013Robinson EOS. The modification, in which parameter \u2018a\u2019 was treated as a variable with respect to pressure for multicomponent multi-phase high density reservoir systems was to improve accuracy in the prediction of properties of complex reservoir fluids for PVT modeling. The variation was represented with a linear equation where a1 and a2 represent the slope and the intercept respectively of the straight line obtained when values of parameter \u2018a\u2019 are plotted against pressure.\nThis modification increases the accuracy of Peng\u2013Robinson equation of state for heavier fluids particularly at pressure ranges (&gt;30MPa) and eliminates the need for tuning the original Peng-Robinson equation of state. Values for a\nElliott, Suresh, Donohue equation of state.\nThe Elliott, Suresh, and Donohue (ESD) equation of state was proposed in 1990. The equation seeks to correct a shortcoming in the Peng\u2013Robinson EOS in that there was an inaccuracy in the van der Waals repulsive term. The EOS accounts for the effect of the shape of a non-polar molecule and can be extended to polymers with the addition of an extra term (not shown). The EOS itself was developed through modeling computer simulations and should capture the essential physics of the size, shape, and hydrogen bonding.\nwhere:\nand\nwhere\nThe characteristic size parameter is related to the shape parameter formula_89 through\nwhere\nNoting the relationships between Boltzmann's constant and the Universal gas constant, and observing that the number of molecules can be expressed in terms of Avogadro's number and the molar mass, the reduced number density formula_127 can be expressed in terms of the molar volume as\nThe shape parameter formula_138 appearing in the Attraction term and the term formula_139 are given by\nwhere formula_142 is the depth of the square-well potential and is given by\nThe model can be extended to associating components and mixtures of nonassociating components. Details are in the paper by J.R. Elliott, Jr. \"et al.\" (1990).\nCubic-Plus-Association.\nThe Cubic-Plus-Association (CPA) equation of state combines the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation with an association term from Wertheim theory. The development of the equation began in 1995 as a research project that was funded by Shell, and in 1996 an article was published which presented the CPA equation of state.\nIn the association term formula_153 is the mole fraction of molecules not bonded at site A.\nNon-cubic equations of state.\nDieterici equation of state.\nwhere \"a\" is associated with the interaction between molecules and \"b\" takes into account the finite size of the molecules, similar to the Van der Waals equation.\nThe reduced coordinates are:\nVirial equations of state.\nVirial equation of state.\nAlthough usually not the most convenient equation of state, the virial equation is important because it can be derived directly from statistical mechanics. This equation is also called the Kamerlingh Onnes equation. If appropriate assumptions are made about the mathematical form of intermolecular forces, theoretical expressions can be developed for each of the coefficients. \"A\" is the first virial coefficient, which has a constant value of 1 and makes the statement that when volume is large, all fluids behave like ideal gases. The second virial coefficient \"B\" corresponds to interactions between pairs of molecules, \"C\" to triplets, and so on. Accuracy can be increased indefinitely by considering higher order terms. The coefficients \"B\", \"C\", \"D\", etc. are functions of temperature only.\nOne of the most accurate equations of state is that from Benedict-Webb-Rubin-Starling shown next. It was very close to a virial equation of state. If the exponential term in it is expanded to two Taylor terms, a virial equation can be derived:\nNote that in this virial equation, the fourth and fifth virial terms are zero. The second virial coefficient is monotonically decreasing as temperature is lowered. The third virial coefficient is monotonically increasing as temperature is lowered.\nThe BWR equation of state.\nwhere\nValues of the various parameters for 15 substances can be found in \nLee-Kesler equation of state.\nThe Lee-Kesler equation of state is based on the corresponding states principle, and is a modification of the BWR equation of state.\nSAFT equations of state.\nStatistical associating fluid theory (SAFT) equations of state predict the effect of molecular size and shape and hydrogen bonding on fluid properties and phase behavior. The SAFT equation of state was developed using statistical mechanical methods (in particular perturbation theory) to describe the interactions between molecules in a system. The idea of a SAFT equation of state was first proposed by Chapman et al. in 1988 and 1989. Many different versions of the SAFT equation of state have been proposed, but all use the same chain and association terms derived by Chapman. SAFT equations of state represent molecules as chains of typically spherical particles that interact with one another through short range repulsion, long range attraction, and hydrogen bonding between specific sites. One popular version of the SAFT equation of state includes the effect of chain length on the shielding of the dispersion interactions between molecules (PC-SAFT). In general, SAFT equations give more accurate results than traditional cubic equations of state, especially for systems containing liquids or solids.\nMultiparameter equations of state.\nHelmholtz Function form.\nMultiparameter equations of state (MEOS) can be used to represent pure fluids with high accuracy, in both the liquid and gaseous states. MEOS's represent the Helmholtz function of the fluid as the sum of ideal gas and residual terms. Both terms are explicit in reduced temperature and reduced density - thus:\nwhere:\nThe reduced density and temperature are typically, though not always, the critical values for the pure fluid.\nOther thermodynamic functions can be derived from the MEOS by using appropriate derivatives of the Helmholtz function; hence, because integration of the MEOS is not required, there are few restrictions as to the functional form of the ideal or residual terms. Typical MEOS use upwards of 50 fluid specific parameters, but are able to represent the fluid's properties with high accuracy. MEOS are available currently for about 50 of the most common industrial fluids including refrigerants. The IAPWS95 reference equation of state for water is also an MEOS. Mixture models for MEOS exist, as well.\nOne example of such an equation of state is the form proposed by Span and Wagner.\nThis is a somewhat simpler form that is intended to be used more in technical applications. Reference equations of state require a higher accuracy and use a more complicated form with more terms.\nOther equations of state of interest.\nStiffened equation of state.\nWhen considering water under very high pressures, in situations such as underwater nuclear explosions, sonic shock lithotripsy, and sonoluminescence, the stiffened equation of state is often used:\nwhere formula_164 is the internal energy per unit mass, formula_165 is an empirically determined constant typically taken to be about 6.1, and formula_166 is another constant, representing the molecular attraction between water molecules. The magnitude of the correction is about 2 gigapascals (20,000 atmospheres).\nThe equation is stated in this form because the speed of sound in water is given by formula_167.\nThus water behaves as though it is an ideal gas that is \"already\" under about 20,000 atmospheres (2\u00a0GPa) pressure, and explains why water is commonly assumed to be incompressible: when the external pressure changes from 1 atmosphere to 2 atmospheres (100\u00a0kPa to 200\u00a0kPa), the water behaves as an ideal gas would when changing from 20,001 to 20,002 atmospheres (2000.1\u00a0MPa to 2000.2\u00a0MPa).\nThis equation mispredicts the specific heat capacity of water but few simple alternatives are available for severely nonisentropic processes such as strong shocks.\nUltrarelativistic equation of state.\nAn ultrarelativistic fluid has equation of state\nwhere formula_29 is the pressure, formula_170 is the mass density, and formula_171 is the speed of sound.\nIdeal Bose equation of state.\nThe equation of state for an ideal Bose gas is\nwhere \u03b1 is an exponent specific to the system (e.g. in the absence of a potential field, \u03b1 = 3/2), \"z\" is exp(\"\u03bc\"/\"kT\") where \"\u03bc\" is the chemical potential, Li is the polylogarithm, \u03b6 is the Riemann zeta function, and \"T\"\"c\" is the critical temperature at which a Bose\u2013Einstein condensate begins to form.\nJones\u2013Wilkins\u2013Lee equation of state for explosives (JWL equation).\nThe equation of state from Jones\u2013Wilkins\u2013Lee is used to describe the detonation products of explosives.\nThe ratio formula_174 is defined by using formula_175 = density of the explosive (solid part) and formula_176 = density of the detonation products. The parameters formula_177, formula_178, formula_179, formula_180 and formula_181 are given by several references. In addition, the initial density (solid part) formula_182, speed of detonation formula_183, Chapman\u2013Jouguet pressure formula_184 and the chemical energy of the explosive formula_185 are given in such references. These parameters are obtained by fitting the JWL-EOS to experimental results. Typical parameters for some explosives are listed in the table below.\nEquations of state for solids and liquids.\nCommon abbreviations: formula_186"}

The title commonly used in English is a Latin transliteration of the Greek translation of the Hebrew word \u05e7\u05b9\u05d4\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05ea (\"Kohelet\", \"Koheleth\", \"Qoheleth\" or \"Qohelet\"). An unnamed author introduces \"Kohelet\" as the son of David () and does not use his own voice again until the final verses (12:9\u201314), where he gives his own thoughts and summarises the statements of \"Kohelet\"; the main body of the text is ascribed to Kohelet himself. \nKohelet proclaims that all human actions are \"hevel\", \"vapor\" or \"breath\", meaning \"insubstantial\", \"vain\", or \"futile\", since the lives of both wise and foolish people all end in death. While Kohelet clearly endorses wisdom as a means for a well-lived earthly life, he is unable to ascribe eternal meaning to it. In light of this perceived senselessness, he suggests that human beings should enjoy the simple pleasures of daily life, such as eating, drinking, and taking enjoyment in one's work, which are gifts from the hand of God. The book concludes with the injunction to \"Fear God and keep his commandments; for that is the whole duty of everyone. Since every deed will God bring to judgment, for every hidden act, be it good or evil\".\nTitle.\n\"Ecclesiastes\" is a phonetic transliteration of the Greek word \u1f18\u03ba\u03ba\u03bb\u03b7\u03c3\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03c2 (\"Ekklesiastes\"), which in the Septuagint translates the Hebrew name of its stated author, Kohelet (\u05e7\u05b9\u05d4\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05ea). The Greek word derives from \"ekklesia\" (assembly) as the Hebrew word derives from \"kahal\" (assembly), but while the Greek word means 'member of an assembly', the meaning of the original Hebrew word it translates is less certain. As Strong's concordance mentions, it is a female active participle of the verb \"kahal\" in its simple (Qal) paradigm, a form not used elsewhere in the Bible and which is sometimes understood as active or passive depending on the verb, so that Kohelet would mean '(female) assembler' in the active case (recorded as such by Strong's concordance), and '(female) assembled, member of an assembly' in the passive case (as per the Septuagint translators). According to the majority understanding today, the word is a more general (mishkal \u05e7\u05d5\u05b9\u05d8\u05b6\u05dc\u05b6\u05ea) form rather than a literal participle, and the intended meaning of Kohelet in the text is 'someone speaking before an assembly', hence 'Teacher' or 'Preacher'.\nStructure.\nEcclesiastes is presented as biography of \"Kohelet\" or \"Qoheleth\"; his story is framed by the voice of the narrator, who refers to Kohelet in the third person, praises his wisdom, but reminds the reader that wisdom has its limitations and is not man's main concern. Kohelet reports what he planned, did, experienced and thought, but his journey to knowledge is, in the end, incomplete; the reader is not only to hear Kohelet's wisdom, but to observe his journey towards understanding and acceptance of life's frustrations and uncertainties: the journey itself is important.\nFew of the many attempts to uncover an underlying structure to Ecclesiastes have met with widespread acceptance; among them, the following is one of the more influential:\nDespite the acceptance by some of this structure, there have been many scathing criticisms, such as that of Fox: \"[Addison G. Wright's] proposed structure has no more effect on interpretation than a ghost in the attic. A literary or rhetorical structure should not merely 'be there'; it must \"do\" something. It should guide readers in recognizing and remembering the author's train of thought.\" \nVerse 1:1 is a superscription, the ancient equivalent of a title page: it introduces the book as \"the words of Kohelet, son of David, king in Jerusalem.\"\nMost, though not all, modern commentators regard the epilogue (12:9\u201314) as an addition by a later scribe. Some have identified certain other statements as further additions intended to make the book more religiously orthodox (e.g., the affirmations of God's justice and the need for piety).\nIt has been proposed that the text is composed of three distinct voices. The first belongs to Qoheleth as the prophet, the \"true voice of wisdom\" which speaks in the first person, recounting wisdom through his own experience. The second voice belongs to Qoheleth as the king of Jerusalem, who is more didactic and thus speaks primarily in second-person imperative statements. The third voice is that of the epilogist, who speaks proverbially in the third person. The epilogist is most identified seen in the book's first and final verses. Ecclesiastes should then be read as a dialogue between these voices, Kyle R. Greenwood suggests.\nSummary.\nThe ten-verse introduction in verses 1:2\u201311 are the words of the frame narrator; they set the mood for what is to follow. Kohelet's message is that all is meaningless.\nAfter the introduction come the words of Kohelet. As king he has experienced everything and done everything, but nothing is ultimately reliable. Death levels all. The only good is to partake of life in the present, for enjoyment is from the hand of God. Everything is ordered in time and people are subject to time in contrast to God's eternal character. The world is filled with injustice, which only God will adjudicate. God and humans do not belong in the same realm and it is therefore necessary to have a right attitude before God. People should enjoy, but should not be greedy; no-one knows what is good for humanity; righteousness and wisdom escape us. Kohelet reflects on the limits of human power: all people face death, and death is better than life, but we should enjoy life when we can. The world is full of risk: he gives advice on living with risk, both political and economic. Mortals should take pleasure when they can, for a time may come when no one can. Kohelet's words finish with imagery of nature languishing and humanity marching to the grave.\nThe frame narrator returns with an epilogue: the words of the wise are hard, but they are applied as the shepherd applies goads and pricks to his flock. The ending of the book sums up its message: \"Fear God and keep his commandments for God will bring every deed to judgement.\" Some scholars suggest 12:13-14 were an addition by a more orthodox author than the original writer; others think it is likely the work of the original author. \nComposition.\nTitle, date and author.\nThe book takes its name from the Greek \"ekklesiastes\", a translation of the title by which the central figure refers to himself: \"Kohelet\", meaning something like \"one who convenes or addresses an assembly\". According to rabbinic tradition, Ecclesiastes was written by Solomon in his old age (an alternative tradition that \"Hezekiah and his colleagues wrote Isaiah, Proverbs, the Song of Songs and Ecclesiastes\" probably means simply that the book was edited under Hezekiah), but critical scholars have long rejected the idea of a pre-exilic origin. The presence of Persian loan-words and Aramaisms points to a date no earlier than about 450 BCE, while the latest possible date for its composition is 180 BCE, when the Jewish writer Ben Sira quotes from it. The dispute as to whether Ecclesiastes belongs to the Persian or the Hellenistic periods (i.e., the earlier or later part of this period) revolves around the degree of Hellenization (influence of Greek culture and thought) present in the book. Scholars arguing for a Persian date (c. 450\u2013330 BCE) hold that there is a complete lack of Greek influence; those who argue for a Hellenistic date (c. 330\u2013180 BCE) argue that it shows internal evidence of Greek thought and social setting.\nAlso unresolved is whether the author and narrator of Kohelet are one and the same person. Ecclesiastes regularly switches between third-person quotations of Kohelet and first-person reflections on Kohelet's words, which would indicate the book was written as a commentary on Kohelet's parables rather than a personally-authored repository of his sayings. Some scholars have argued that the third-person narrative structure is an artificial literary device along the lines of Uncle Remus, although the description of the Kohelet in 12:8\u201314 seems to favour a historical person whose thoughts are presented by the narrator. The question, however, has no theological importance, and one scholar (Roland Murphy) has commented that Kohelet himself would have regarded the time and ingenuity put into interpreting his book as \"one more example of the futility of human effort\".\nGenre and setting.\nEcclesiastes has taken its literary form from the Middle Eastern tradition of the fictional autobiography, in which a character, often a king, relates his experiences and draws lessons from them, often self-critical: Kohelet likewise identifies himself as a king, speaks of his search for wisdom, relates his conclusions, and recognises his limitations. It belongs to the category of wisdom literature, the body of biblical writings which give advice on life, together with reflections on its problems and meanings\u2014other examples include the Book of Job, Proverbs, and some of the Psalms. Ecclesiastes differs from the other biblical Wisdom books in being deeply skeptical of the usefulness of Wisdom itself. Ecclesiastes in turn influenced the deuterocanonical works, Wisdom of Solomon and Sirach, both of which contain vocal rejections of the Ecclesiastical philosophy of futility.\nWisdom was a popular genre in the ancient world, where it was cultivated in scribal circles and directed towards young men who would take up careers in high officialdom and royal courts; there is strong evidence that some of these books, or at least sayings and teachings, were translated into Hebrew and influenced the Book of Proverbs, and the author of Ecclesiastes was probably familiar with examples from Egypt and Mesopotamia. He may also have been influenced by Greek philosophy, specifically the schools of Stoicism, which held that all things are fated, and Epicureanism, which held that happiness was best pursued through the quiet cultivation of life's simpler pleasures.\nCanonicity.\nThe presence of Ecclesiastes in the Bible is something of a puzzle, as the common themes of the Hebrew canon\u2014a God who reveals and redeems, who elects and cares for a chosen people\u2014are absent from it, which suggests that Kohelet had lost his faith in his old age. Understanding the book was a topic of the earliest recorded discussions (the hypothetical Council of Jamnia in the 1st century CE). One argument advanced at that time was that the name of Solomon carried enough authority to ensure its inclusion; however, other works which appeared with Solomon's name were excluded despite being more orthodox than Ecclesiastes. Another was that the words of the epilogue, in which the reader is told to fear God and keep his commands, made it orthodox; but all later attempts to find anything in the rest of the book that would reflect this orthodoxy have failed. A modern suggestion treats the book as a dialogue in which different statements belong to different voices, with Kohelet himself answering and refuting unorthodox opinions, but there are no explicit markers for this in the book, as there are (for example) in the Book of Job. Yet another suggestion is that Ecclesiastes is simply the most extreme example of a tradition of skepticism, but none of the proposed examples match Ecclesiastes for a sustained denial of faith and doubt in the goodness of God. \"In short, we do not know why or how this book found its way into such esteemed company\", summarizes Martin A. Shields in his 2006 book \"The End of Wisdom: A Reappraisal of the Historical and Canonical Function of Ecclesiastes\".\nThemes.\nScholars disagree about the themes of Ecclesiastes: whether it is positive and life-affirming, or deeply pessimistic; whether it is coherent or incoherent, insightful or confused, orthodox or heterodox; whether the ultimate message of the book is to copy Kohelet, the wise man, or to avoid his errors. At times Kohelet raises deep questions; he \"doubted every aspect of religion, from the very ideal of righteousness, to the by now traditional idea of divine justice for individuals\". Some passages of Ecclesiastes seem to contradict other portions of the Old Testament, and even itself. The Talmud even suggests that the rabbis considered censoring Ecclesiastes due to its seeming contradictions. One suggestion for resolving the contradictions is to read the book as the record of Kohelet's quest for knowledge: opposing judgments (e.g., \"the dead are better off than the living\" (4:2) vs. \"a living dog is better off than a dead lion\" (9:4) are therefore provisional, and it is only at the conclusion that the verdict is delivered (11\u201312:7). On this reading, Kohelet's sayings are goads, designed to provoke dialogue and reflection in his readers, rather than to reach premature and self-assured conclusions.\nThe subjects of Ecclesiastes are the pain and frustration engendered by observing and meditating on the distortions and inequities pervading the world, the uselessness of human deeds, and the limitations of wisdom and righteousness. The phrase \"under the sun\" appears twenty-nine times in connection with these observations; all this coexists with a firm belief in God, whose power, justice and unpredictability are sovereign. History and nature move in cycles, so that all events are predetermined and unchangeable, and life has no meaning or purpose: the wise man and the man who does not study wisdom will both die and be forgotten: man should be reverent (\"Fear God\"), but in this life it is best to simply enjoy God's gifts.\nJudaism.\nIn Judaism, Ecclesiastes is read either on Shemini Atzeret (by Yemenites, Italians, some Sepharadim, and the mediaeval French Jewish rite) or on the Shabbat of the Intermediate Days of Sukkot (by Ashkenazim). If there is no Intermediate Sabbath of Sukkot, Ashkenazim too read it on Shemini Atzeret (or, in Israel, on the first Shabbat of Sukkot). It is read on Sukkot as a reminder not to get too caught up in the festivities of the holiday, and to carry over the happiness of Sukkot to the rest of the year by telling the listeners that, without God, life is meaningless.\nThe final poem of Kohelet has been interpreted in the Targum, Talmud and Midrash, and by the rabbis Rashi, Rashbam and ibn Ezra, as an allegory of old age.\nCatholicism.\nEcclesiastes has been cited in the writings of past and current Catholic Church leaders. For example, doctors of the Church have cited Ecclesiastes. St. Augustine of Hippo cited Ecclesiastes in Book XX of \"City of God\". Saint Jerome wrote a commentary on Ecclesiastes. St. Thomas Aquinas cited Ecclesiastes (\"The number of fools is infinite.\") in his \"Summa Theologica\".\nThe twentieth-century Catholic theologian and cardinal-elect Hans Urs von Balthasar discusses Ecclesiastes in his work on theological aesthetics, \"The Glory of the Lord\". He describes Qoheleth as \"a critical transcendentalist \"avant la lettre\"\", whose God is distant from the world, and whose \"kairos\" is a \"form of time which is itself empty of meaning\". For Balthasar, the role of Ecclesiastes in the Biblical canon is to represent the \"final dance on the part of wisdom, [the] conclusion of the ways of man\", a logical end-point to the unfolding of human wisdom in the Old Testament that paves the way for the advent of the New.\nThe book continues to be cited by recent popes, including Pope John Paul II and Pope Francis. Pope John Paul II, in his general audience of October 20, 2004, called the author of Ecclesiastes \"an ancient biblical sage\" whose description of death \"makes frantic clinging to earthly things completely pointless.\" Pope Francis cited Ecclesiastes on his address on September 9, 2014. Speaking of vain people, he said, \"How many Christians live for appearances? Their life seems like a soap bubble.\"\nInfluence on Western literature.\nEcclesiastes has had a deep influence on Western literature. It contains several phrases that have resonated in British and American culture, such as \"eat, drink and be merry\", \"nothing new under the sun\", \"a time to be born and a time to die\", and \"vanity of vanities; all is vanity\". American novelist Thomas Wolfe wrote: \"[O]f all I have ever seen or learned, that book seems to me the noblest, the wisest, and the most powerful expression of man's life upon this earth\u2014and also the highest flower of poetry, eloquence, and truth. I am not given to dogmatic judgments in the matter of literary creation, but if I had to make one I could say that Ecclesiastes is the greatest single piece of writing I have ever known, and the wisdom expressed in it the most lasting and profound.\""}
{"id": "9911", "revid": "1023435717", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9911", "title": "Ezekiel", "text": "Ezekiel (; \"Y\u0115\u1e25ezq\u0113\u02bel\" ; in the Septuagint written in \"Iezeki\u1e17l\" ) is the central protagonist of the Book of Ezekiel in the Hebrew Bible.\nIn Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, Ezekiel is acknowledged as a Hebrew prophet. In Judaism and Christianity, he is also viewed as the 6th-century BCE author of the Book of Ezekiel, which reveals prophecies regarding the destruction of Jerusalem, and the restoration to the land of Israel.\nLife.\nThe author of the Book of Ezekiel presents himself as Ezekiel, the son of Buzzi, born into a priestly (kohen) lineage. Apart from identifying himself, the author gives a date for the first divine encounter which he presents: \"in the thirtieth year\". If this is a reference to Ezekiel's age at the time, he was born around 622 BCE, about the time of Josiah's reforms, and shortly after the call of Jeremiah to a prophetic ministry around 626 BCE. Ezekiel's \"thirtieth year\" is given as five years after the exile of Judah's king Jehoiachin by the Babylonians. The Aramaic Targum on Ezekiel 1:1, however, as well as the 2nd-century rabbinic work \"Seder Olam Rabba\" (chapter 26), take a different approach, where they both say that Ezekiel's vision came \"in the thirtieth year after Josiah was presented with a Book of the Law discovered in the Temple\".\nAccording to Jewish tradition, Ezekiel did not write his own book, the Book of Ezekiel, but rather his prophecies were collected and written by the Men of the Great Assembly. Josephus claims that Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia's armies exiled three thousand Jews from Judah, after deposing King Jehoiakim in 598 BCE.\nThe name Ezekiel means \"God Strengthens.\"\nLiving in Babylon.\nAccording to the Bible, Ezekiel and his wife lived during the Babylonian captivity on the banks of the Chebar River, in Tel Abib, with other exiles from Judah. There is no mention of him having any offspring.\nProphetic career.\nEzekiel describes his calling to be a prophet by going into great detail about his encounter with God and four \"living creatures\" with four wheels that stayed beside the creatures. For the next five years he incessantly prophesied and acted out the destruction of Jerusalem and its temple, which was met with some opposition. However, Ezekiel and his contemporaries like Jeremiah, another prophet who was living in Jerusalem at that time, witnessed the fulfillment of their prophecies with the siege of Jerusalem by the Babylonians. On the hypothesis that the \"thirtieth year\" of refers to Ezekiel's age, Ezekiel was fifty years old when he had his final vision. On the basis of dates given in the Book of Ezekiel, his span of prophecies can be calculated to have occurred over the course of about 22 years. The last recorded prophecy of Ezekiel dates to April 570 BCE.\nWorld views.\nJewish tradition.\nEzekiel, like Jeremiah, is said by Talmud and Midrash to have been a descendant of Joshua by his marriage with the proselyte and former prostitute Rahab. Some statements found in rabbinic literature posit that Ezekiel was the son of Jeremiah, who was (also) called \"Buzi\" because he was despised by the Jews.\nEzekiel was said to be already active as a prophet while in the Land of Israel, and he retained this gift when he was exiled with Jehoiachin and the nobles of the country to Babylon.\nRava states in the Babylonian Talmud that although Ezekiel describes the appearance of the throne of God (Merkabah), this is not because he had seen more than the prophet Isaiah, but rather because the latter was more accustomed to such visions; for the relation of the two prophets is that of a courtier to a peasant, the latter of whom would always describe a royal court more floridly than the former, to whom such things would be familiar. Ezekiel, like all the other prophets, has beheld only a blurred reflection of the divine majesty, just as a poor mirror reflects objects only imperfectly.\nAccording to the midrash \"Canticles Rabbah\", it was Ezekiel whom the three pious men, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah (also called Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the Bible) asked for advice as to whether they should resist Nebuchadnezzar's command and choose death by fire rather than worship his idol. At first God revealed to the prophet that they could not hope for a miraculous rescue; whereupon the prophet was greatly grieved, since these three men constituted the \"remnant of Judah\". But after they had left the house of the prophet, fully determined to sacrifice their lives to God, Ezekiel received this revelation: \"Thou dost believe indeed that I will abandon them. That shall not happen; but do thou let them carry out their intention according to their pious dictates, and tell them nothing\".\nChristianity.\nEzekiel is commemorated as a saint in the liturgical calendar of the Eastern Orthodox Church\u2014and those Eastern Catholic Churches which follow the Byzantine Rite\u2014on July 21 (for those churches which use the traditional Julian Calendar, July 21 falls on August 5 of the modern Gregorian Calendar). Ezekiel is commemorated on August 28 on the Calendar of Saints of the Armenian Apostolic Church, and on April 10 in the Roman Martyrology.\nCertain Lutheran churches also celebrate his commemoration on July 21.\nSaint Bonaventure interpreted Ezekiel's statement about the \"closed gate\" as a prophecy of the Incarnation: the \"gate\" signifying the Virgin Mary and the \"prince\" referring to Jesus. This is one of the readings at Vespers on Great Feasts of the Theotokos in the Eastern Orthodox and Byzantine Catholic Churches. This imagery is also found in the traditional Catholic Christmas hymn \"Gaudete\" and in a saying by Bonaventure, quoted by Alphonsus Maria de' Liguori: \"No one can enter Heaven unless by Mary, as though through a door.\" The imagery provides the basis for the concept that God gave Mary to humanity as the \"Gate of Heaven\" (thence the dedication of churches and convents to the Porta Coeli), an idea also laid out in the \"Salve Regina\" (Hail Holy Queen) prayer.\nJohn B. Taylor credits the subject with imparting the Biblical understanding of the nature of God.\nIslamic tradition.\nEzekiel is recognized as a prophet in Islamic tradition. Although not mentioned in the Qur'an by the name, Muslim scholars, both classical and modern have included Ezekiel in lists of the prophets of Islam.\nThe Qur'an mentions a prophet called Zul-Kifl. This prophet is sometimes identified with Ezekiel although Zul-Kifl's identity is disputed. Carsten Niebuhr, in his \"Reisebeschreibung nach Arabian\", says he visited Al Kifl in Iraq, midway between Najaf and Hilla and said \"Kifl\" was the Arabic form of \"Ezekiel\". He further explained in his book that Ezekiel's Tomb was present in Al Kifl and that the Jews came to it on pilgrimage. The name \"Zul-Kifl\" or more correctly \"Dh\u016b l-Kifl\" () would mean \"Possessor of the Double\" or \"Possesor of the Fold\" ( \"dh\u016b\" \"possessor of, owner of\" and \"al-kifl\" \"double, folded\"). Some Islamic scholars have likened Ezekiel's mission to the description of Dhul-Kifl. When the exile, monarchy, and state were annihilated, a political and national life was no longer possible. In the absence of a worldly foundation it became necessary to build a spiritual one and Ezekiel performed this mission by observing the signs of the time and deducing his doctrines from them. In conformity with the two parts of his book, his personality and his preaching are alike twofold. Aside from the possible identification of Zul-Kifl with Ezekiel, Muslims have viewed Ezekiel as a prophet, regardless of his identification with Zul-Kifl.\nEzekiel appears in all Muslim collections of \"Stories of the Prophets\". Muslim exegesis further lists Ezekiel's father as Buzi (\"Budhi\") and Ezekiel is given the title \"ibn al-\u2018aj\u016bz\", denoting \"son of the old (man)\", as his parents are supposed to have been very old when he was born. A tradition, which resembles that of Hannah and Samuel in the Hebrew Bible, states that Ezekiel's mother prayed to God in old age for the birth of an offspring and was given Ezekiel as a gift from God.\nTomb.\nThe tomb of Ezekiel is a structure located in modern-day south Iraq near Kefil, believed to be the final resting place of Ezekiel. It has been a place of pilgrimage to both Muslims and Jews alike. After the Jewish exodus from Iraq, Jewish activity in the tomb ceased, although a disused synagogue remains in place.\nA tomb in the Ergani province of Diyarbakir, Turkey is also believed to be the resting place of prophet Ezekiel. It is located 5\u00a0km from the city centre on a hill, revered and visited by the local Muslims, called \"Makam Da\u011f\u0131\"."}

First published in the specification for the application binary interface (ABI) of the Unix operating system version named System V Release 4 (SVR4), and later in the Tool Interface Standard, it was quickly accepted among different vendors of Unix systems. In 1999, it was chosen as the standard binary file format for Unix and Unix-like systems on x86 processors by the 86open project.\nBy design, the ELF format is flexible, extensible, and cross-platform. For instance it supports different endiannesses and address sizes so it does not exclude any particular central processing unit (CPU) or instruction set architecture. This has allowed it to be adopted by many different operating systems on many different hardware platforms.\nFile layout.\nEach ELF file is made up of one ELF header, followed by file data. The data can include:\nThe segments contain information that is needed for run time execution of the file, while sections contain important data for linking and relocation. Any byte in the entire file can be owned by one section at most, and orphan bytes can occur which are unowned by any section.\nFile header.\nThe ELF header defines whether to use 32-bit or 64-bit addresses. The header contains three fields that are affected by this setting and offset other fields that follow them. The ELF header is 52 or 64 bytes long for 32-bit and 64-bit binaries respectively.\nProgram header.\nThe program header table tells the system how to create a process image. It is found at file offset , and consists of entries, each with size . The layout is slightly different in 32-bit ELF vs 64-bit ELF, because the are in a different structure location for alignment reasons. Each entry is structured as:\nApplications.\nUnix-like systems.\nThe ELF format has replaced older executable formats in various environments.\nIt has replaced a.out and COFF formats in Unix-like operating systems:\nNon-Unix adoption.\nELF has also seen some adoption in non-Unix operating systems, such as:\nGame consoles.\nSome game consoles also use ELF:\nPowerPC.\nOther (operating) systems running on PowerPC that use ELF:\nMobile phones.\nSome operating systems for mobile phones and mobile devices use ELF:\nSome phones can run ELF files through the use of a patch that adds assembly code to the main firmware, which is a feature known as \"ELFPack\" in the underground modding culture. The ELF file format is also used with the Atmel AVR (8-bit), AVR32\nand with Texas Instruments MSP430 microcontroller architectures. Some implementations of Open Firmware can also load ELF files, most notably Apple's implementation used in almost all PowerPC machines the company produced.\nSpecifications.\nThe Linux Standard Base (LSB) supplements some of the above specifications for architectures in which it is specified. For example, that is the case for the System V ABI, AMD64 Supplement.\n86open.\n86open was a project to form consensus on a common binary file format for Unix and Unix-like operating systems on the common PC compatible x86 architecture, to encourage software developers to port to the architecture. The initial idea was to standardize on a small subset of Spec 1170, a predecessor of the Single UNIX Specification, and the GNU C Library (glibc) to enable unmodified binaries to run on the x86 Unix-like operating systems. The project was originally designated \"Spec 150\".\nThe format eventually chosen was ELF, specifically the Linux implementation of ELF, after it had turned out to be a \"de facto\" standard supported by all involved vendors and operating systems.\nThe group began email discussions in 1997 and first met together at the Santa Cruz Operation offices on August 22, 1997.\nThe steering committee was Marc Ewing, Dion Johnson, Evan Leibovitch, Bruce Perens, Andrew Roach, Bryan Wayne Sparks and Linus Torvalds. Other people on the project were Keith Bostic, Chuck Cranor, Michael Davidson, Chris G. Demetriou, Ulrich Drepper, Don Dugger, Steve Ginzburg, Jon \"maddog\" Hall, Ron Holt, Jordan Hubbard, Dave Jensen, Kean Johnston, Andrew Josey, Robert Lipe, Bela Lubkin, Tim Marsland, Greg Page, Ronald Joe Record, Tim Ruckle, Joel Silverstein, Chia-pi Tien, and Erik Troan. Operating systems and companies represented were BeOS, BSDI, FreeBSD, Intel, Linux, NetBSD, SCO and SunSoft.\nThe project progressed and in mid-1998, SCO began developing lxrun, an open-source compatibility layer able to run Linux binaries on OpenServer, UnixWare, and Solaris. SCO announced official support of lxrun at LinuxWorld in March 1999. Sun Microsystems began officially supporting lxrun for Solaris in early 1999, and later moved to integrated support of the Linux binary format via Solaris Containers for Linux Applications.\nWith the BSDs having long supported Linux binaries (through a compatibility layer) and the main x86 Unix vendors having added support for the format, the project decided that Linux ELF was the format chosen by the industry and \"declare[d] itself dissolved\" on July 25, 1999.\nFatELF: universal binaries for Linux.\nFatELF is an ELF binary-format extension that adds fat binary capabilities. It is aimed for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. Additionally to the CPU architecture abstraction (byte order, word size, CPU instruction set etc.), there is the potential advantage of software-platform abstraction e.g., binaries which support multiple kernel ABI versions. , FatELF has not been integrated into the mainline Linux Kernel."}

Launched in 1958, Explorer 1 was the first spacecraft of the United States to achieve orbit. Over 90 space missions have been launched since. Starting with Explorer 6, it has been operated by NASA, with regular collaboration with a variety of other institutions, including many international partners.\nLaunchers for the Explorers Program have included Jupiter C (Juno I), Juno II, various Thor, Scout, Delta and Pegasus rockets, and Falcon 9.\nCurrently, the program has three classes: Medium-Class Explorers (MIDEX), Small Explorers (SMEX), and University-Class Explorers (UNEX), with select Missions of Opportunity operated with other agencies.\nHistory.\nEarly Explorer Satellites.\nThe Explorers Program began as a U.S. Army proposal (Project Orbiter) to place a \"civilian\" artificial satellite into orbit during the International Geophysical Year. Although that proposal was rejected in favor of the U.S. Navy's Project Vanguard, which made the first sub-orbital flight Vanguard TV0 in December 1956, the Soviet Union's launch of Sputnik 1 on October 4, 1957 (and the resulting \"Sputnik crisis\") and the failure of the Vanguard 1 launch attempt resulted in the Army program being funded to match the Soviet space achievements. Explorer 1 was launched on the Juno-I on January 31, 1958, becoming the first U.S. satellite, as well as discovering the Van Allen radiation belt.\nFour follow-up satellites of the Explorer series were launched by the Juno I rocket in 1958, of which Explorer 3 and Explorer 4 were successful, while Explorer 2 and Explorer 5 failed to reach orbit. The Juno-1 vehicle was replaced by the Juno II in 1959.\nContinuation of the Explorers program.\nWith the establishment of NASA in 1958, the Explorers Program was transferred to NASA from the US Army. \nNASA continued to use the name for an ongoing series of relatively small space missions, typically an artificial satellite with a specific science focus. Explorer 6 in 1959 was the first scientific satellite under the project direction of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center.\nThe Interplanetary Monitoring Platform (IMP) was launched in 1963, and involved a network of eleven Explorer satellites designed to collect data on space radiation in support of the Apollo program. The IMP program was a major step forward in spacecraft electronics design, as it was the first space program to use integrated circuit (IC) chips and MOSFETs (MOS transistors). The IMP A (Explorer 18) in 1963 was the first spacecraft to use IC chips, and the IMP D (Explorer 33) in 1966 was the first to use MOSFETs.\nOver the following two decades, NASA has launched over 50 Explorer missions, some in conjunction to military programs, usually of an exploratory or survey nature or had specific objectives not requiring the capabilities of a major space observatory. Explorer satellites have made many important discoveries on: Earth's magnetosphere and the shape of its gravity field; the solar wind; properties of micrometeoroids raining down on the Earth; ultraviolet, cosmic and X-rays from the Solar System and beyond; ionospheric physics; Solar plasma; solar energetic particles; and atmospheric physics. These missions have also investigated air density, radio astronomy, geodesy, and gamma-ray astronomy.\nWith drops in NASA's budget, Explorer missions became infrequent in the early 1980s.\nSMEX, MIDEX, and Student Explorer programs.\nIn 1988, the Small Explorer (SMEX) class was established with a focus on frequent flight opportunities for highly focused and relatively inexpensive space science missions in the disciplines of astrophysics and space physics. The first three SMEX missions were chosen in April 1989 out of 51 candidates, and launched in 1992, 1996 and 1998. The second set of two missions were announced in September 1994 and launched in 1998 and 1999.\nIn the mid 1990s, NASA initiated the Medium-class Explorer (MIDEX) to enable more frequent flights. These are larger than SMEX missions and were to be launched aboard a new kind of medium-light class launch vehicle. This new launch vehicle was not developed and instead, these missions were flown on a modified Delta II rocket. The first announcement opportunity for MIDEX was issued in March 1995, and the first launch under this new class was FUSE in 1999.\nIn May 1994, NASA started the Student Explorer Demonstration Initiative (STEDI) pilot program, to demonstrate that high-quality space science can be carried out with small, low-cost missions. Of the three selected missions, SNOE was launched in 1998 and TERRIERS in 1999, but the latter failed after launch. The STEDI program was terminated in 2001. Later, NASA established the University-Class Explorers (UNEX) program for much cheaper missions, which is regarded as a successor to STEDI.\nThe Explorer missions were at first managed by the Small Explorer Project Office at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). In early 1999, that office was closed and with the announcement of opportunity for the third set of SMEX missions NASA converted the SMEX class so that each mission was managed by its Principal Investigator, with oversight by the GSFC Explorers Project. The Explorers Program Office at Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, provides management of the many operational scientific exploration missions that are characterized by relatively moderate costs and small to medium-sized missions that are capable of being built, tested, and launched in a short time interval compared to larger observatories like NASA's Great Observatories.\nExcluding the launches, the MIDEX class has a current mission cap cost of in 2018, with future MIDEX missions being capped at $350 million. The cost cap for SMEX missions in 2017 was $165 million. UNEX missions are capped at $15 million. A sub-project called Missions of Opportunity (MO) has funded science instruments or hardware components of onboard non-NASA space missions, and have a total NASA cost cap of $70 million.\nClasses.\nSmall Explorers (SMEX).\nThe Small Explorers class was implemented in 1989 specifically to fund space exploration missions that cost no more than . The missions are managed by the Explorers Project at the Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC).\nThe first set of three SMEX missions were launched between 1992 and 1998. The second set of two missions were launched in 1998 and 1999. These early missions were managed by the Small Explorer Project Office at Goddard Space Flight Center. In early 1999, that office was closed and with the announcement of opportunity for the third set of SMEX missions NASA converted the program so that each mission was managed by its Principal Investigator, with oversight by the GSFC Explorers Project.\nNASA funded a competitive study of five candidate heliophysics Small Explorers missions for flight in 2022. The proposals were Mechanisms of Energetic Mass Ejection \u2013 eXplorer (MEME-X), Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI), Multi-Slit Solar Explorer (MUSE), Tandem Reconnection and Cusp Electrodynamics Reconnaissance Satellites (TRACERS), and Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere (PUNCH). In June 2019 NASA selected TRACERS and PUNCH for flight.\nMissions of Opportunity (MO).\nMissions of Opportunity (MO) are investigations characterized by being part of a non-NASA space mission of any size and having a total NASA cost of under $55 million. These missions are conducted on a no-exchange-of-funds basis with the organization sponsoring the mission. NASA solicits proposals for Missions of Opportunity on SMEX, MIDEX and UNEX investigations.\nLaunched spacecraft.\nExplorers name numbers can be found in the NSSDC master catalog, typically assigned to each spacecraft in a mission. These numbers were not officially assigned until after 1975.\nCancelled missions.\nMany missions are proposed, but not selected. For example, in 2011, the Explorers Program received 22 full missions solicitations, 20 Missions of Opportunity, and 8 USPI. Sometimes mission are only partially developed but must be stopped for financial, technological, or bureaucratic reasons. Some missions failed upon reaching orbit including WIRE and TERRIERS.\nExamples of missions that were not developed or cancelled were:\nRecent examples of conclusions of launched missions, cancelled due to budgetary constraints:\nLaunch statistics.\nNumber of launches per decade: "}

{"id": "9920", "revid": "41804510", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9920", "title": "Electronic oscillator", "text": "An electronic oscillator is an electronic circuit that produces a periodic, oscillating electronic signal, often a sine wave or a square wave or a triangle wave. Oscillators convert direct current (DC) from a power supply to an alternating current (AC) signal. They are widely used in many electronic devices ranging from simplest clock generators to digital instruments (like calculators) and complex computers and peripherals etc. Common examples of signals generated by oscillators include signals broadcast by radio and television transmitters, clock signals that regulate computers and quartz clocks, and the sounds produced by electronic beepers and video games. \nOscillators are often characterized by the frequency of their output signal:\nIn AC power supplies, an oscillator that produces AC power from a DC supply is usually called an inverter. Before the advent of diode-based rectifiers, an electromechanical device that similarly converted AC power to DC was called a converter, though the term is now used more commonly to refer to DC-DC buck converters.\nThere are two main types of electronic oscillator\u00a0\u2013 the linear or harmonic oscillator and the nonlinear or relaxation oscillator.\nCrystal oscillators are ubiquitous in modern electronics and produce frequencies from 32\u00a0kHz to over 150\u00a0MHz, with 32\u00a0kHz crystals commonplace in time keeping and the higher frequencies commonplace in clock generation and RF applications. \nHarmonic oscillators.\nThe harmonic, or \"linear\", oscillator produces a sinusoidal output. There are two types:\nFeedback oscillator.\nThe most common form of linear oscillator is an electronic amplifier such as a transistor or operational amplifier connected in a feedback loop with its output fed back into its input through a frequency selective electronic filter to provide positive feedback. When the power supply to the amplifier is switched on initially, electronic noise in the circuit provides a non-zero signal to get oscillations started. The noise travels around the loop and is amplified and filtered until very quickly it converges on a sine wave at a single frequency.\nFeedback oscillator circuits can be classified according to the type of frequency selective filter they use in the feedback loop:\nNegative-resistance oscillator.\nIn addition to the feedback oscillators described above, which use two-port amplifying active elements such as transistors and operational amplifiers, linear oscillators can also be built using one-port (two terminal) devices with negative resistance, such as magnetron tubes, tunnel diodes, IMPATT diodes and Gunn diodes. Negative-resistance oscillators are usually used at high frequencies in the microwave range and above, since at these frequencies feedback oscillators perform poorly due to excessive phase shift in the feedback path.\nIn negative-resistance oscillators, a resonant circuit, such as an LC circuit, crystal, or cavity resonator, is connected across a device with negative differential resistance, and a DC bias voltage is applied to supply energy. A resonant circuit by itself is \"almost\" an oscillator; it can store energy in the form of electronic oscillations if excited, but because it has electrical resistance and other losses the oscillations are damped and decay to zero. The negative resistance of the active device cancels the (positive) internal loss resistance in the resonator, in effect creating a resonator with no damping, which generates spontaneous continuous oscillations at its resonant frequency.\nThe negative-resistance oscillator model is not limited to one-port devices like diodes; feedback oscillator circuits with two-port amplifying devices such as transistors and tubes also have negative resistance. At high frequencies, three terminal devices such as transistors and FETs are also used in negative resistance oscillators. At high frequencies these devices do not need a feedback loop, but with certain loads applied to one port can become unstable at the other port and show negative resistance due to internal feedback. The negative resistance port is connected to a tuned circuit or resonant cavity, causing them to oscillate. High-frequency oscillators in general are designed using negative-resistance techniques.\nSome of the many harmonic oscillator circuits are listed below:\nRelaxation oscillator.\nA nonlinear or relaxation oscillator produces a non-sinusoidal output, such as a square, sawtooth or triangle wave. It consists of an energy-storing element (a capacitor or, more rarely, an inductor) and a nonlinear switching device (a latch, Schmitt trigger, or negative-resistance element) connected in a feedback loop. The switching device periodically charges and discharges the energy stored in the storage element thus causing abrupt changes in the output waveform.\nSquare-wave relaxation oscillators are used to provide the clock signal for sequential logic circuits such as timers and counters, although crystal oscillators are often preferred for their greater stability. Triangle-wave or sawtooth oscillators are used in the timebase circuits that generate the horizontal deflection signals for cathode ray tubes in analogue oscilloscopes and television sets. They are also used in voltage-controlled oscillators (VCOs), inverters and switching power supplies, dual-slope analog to digital converters (ADCs), and in function generators to generate square and triangle waves for testing equipment. In general, relaxation oscillators are used at lower frequencies and have poorer frequency stability than linear oscillators.\nRing oscillators are built of a ring of active delay stages. Generally the ring has an odd number of inverting stages, so that there is no single stable state for the internal ring voltages. Instead, a single transition propagates endlessly around the ring.\nSome of the more common relaxation oscillator circuits are listed below:\nVoltage-controlled oscillator (VCO).\nAn oscillator can be designed so that the oscillation frequency can be varied over some range by an input voltage or current. These voltage controlled oscillators are widely used in phase-locked loops, in which the oscillator's frequency can be locked to the frequency of another oscillator. These are ubiquitous in modern communications circuits, used in filters, modulators, demodulators, and forming the basis of frequency synthesizer circuits which are used to tune radios and televisions.\nRadio frequency VCOs are usually made by adding a varactor diode to the tuned circuit or resonator in an oscillator circuit. Changing the DC voltage across the varactor changes its capacitance, which changes the resonant frequency of the tuned circuit. Voltage controlled relaxation oscillators can be constructed by charging and discharging the energy storage capacitor with a voltage controlled current source. Increasing the input voltage increases the rate of charging the capacitor, decreasing the time between switching events.\nHistory.\nThe first practical oscillators were based on electric arcs, which were used for lighting in the 19th century. The current through an arc light is unstable due to its negative resistance, and often breaks into spontaneous oscillations, causing the arc to make hissing, humming or howling sounds which had been noticed by Humphry Davy in 1821, Benjamin Silliman in 1822, Auguste Arthur de la Rive in 1846, and David Edward Hughes in 1878. Ernst Lecher in 1888 showed that the current through an electric arc could be oscillatory. An oscillator was built by Elihu Thomson in 1892 by placing an LC tuned circuit in parallel with an electric arc and included a magnetic blowout. Independently, in the same year, George Francis FitzGerald realized that if the damping resistance in a resonant circuit could be made zero or negative, the circuit would produce oscillations, and, unsuccessfully, tried to build a negative resistance oscillator with a dynamo, what would now be called a parametric oscillator. The arc oscillator was rediscovered and popularized by William Duddell in 1900. Duddell, a student at London Technical College, was investigating the hissing arc effect. He attached an LC circuit (tuned circuit) to the electrodes of an arc lamp, and the negative resistance of the arc excited oscillation in the tuned circuit. Some of the energy was radiated as sound waves by the arc, producing a musical tone. Duddell demonstrated his oscillator before the London Institute of Electrical Engineers by sequentially connecting different tuned circuits across the arc to play the national anthem \"God Save the Queen\". Duddell's \"singing arc\" did not generate frequencies above the audio range. In 1902 Danish physicists Valdemar Poulsen and P. O. Pederson were able to increase the frequency produced into the radio range by operating the arc in a hydrogen atmosphere with a magnetic field, inventing the Poulsen arc radio transmitter, the first continuous wave radio transmitter, which was used through the 1920s.\nThe vacuum-tube feedback oscillator was invented around 1912, when it was discovered that feedback (\"regeneration\") in the recently invented audion vacuum tube could produce oscillations. At least six researchers independently made this discovery, although not all of them can be said to have a role in the invention of the oscillator. In the summer of 1912, Edwin Armstrong observed oscillations in audion radio receiver circuits and went on to use positive feedback in his invention of the regenerative receiver. Austrian Alexander Meissner independently discovered positive feedback and invented oscillators in March 1913. Irving Langmuir at General Electric observed feedback in 1913. Fritz Lowenstein may have preceded the others with a crude oscillator in late 1911. In Britain, H. J. Round patented amplifying and oscillating circuits in 1913. In August 1912, Lee De Forest, the inventor of the audion, had also observed oscillations in his amplifiers, but he didn't understand the significance and tried to eliminate it until he read Armstrong's patents in 1914, which he promptly challenged. Armstrong and De Forest fought a protracted legal battle over the rights to the \"regenerative\" oscillator circuit which has been called \"the most complicated patent litigation in the history of radio\". De Forest ultimately won before the Supreme Court in 1934 on technical grounds, but most sources regard Armstrong's claim as the stronger one.\nThe first and most widely used relaxation oscillator circuit, the astable multivibrator, was invented in 1917 by French engineers Henri Abraham and Eugene Bloch. They called their cross-coupled, dual-vacuum-tube circuit a \"multivibrateur\", because the square-wave signal it produced was rich in harmonics, compared to the sinusoidal signal of other vacuum-tube oscillators.\nVacuum-tube feedback oscillators became the basis of radio transmission by 1920. However, the triode vacuum tube oscillator performed poorly above 300\u00a0MHz because of interelectrode capacitance. To reach higher frequencies, new \"transit time\" (velocity modulation) vacuum tubes were developed, in which electrons traveled in \"bunches\" through the tube. The first of these was the Barkhausen\u2013Kurz oscillator (1920), the first tube to produce power in the UHF range. The most important and widely used were the klystron (R. and S. Varian, 1937) and the cavity magnetron (J. Randall and H. Boot, 1940).\nMathematical conditions for feedback oscillations, now called the Barkhausen criterion, were derived by Heinrich Georg Barkhausen in 1921. The first analysis of a nonlinear electronic oscillator model, the Van der Pol oscillator, was done by Balthasar van der Pol in 1927. He showed that the stability of the oscillations (limit cycles) in actual oscillators was due to the nonlinearity of the amplifying device. He originated the term \"relaxation oscillation\" and was first to distinguish between linear and relaxation oscillators. Further advances in mathematical analysis of oscillation were made by Hendrik Wade Bode and Harry Nyquist in the 1930s. In 1969 K. Kurokawa derived necessary and sufficient conditions for oscillation in negative-resistance circuits, which form the basis of modern microwave oscillator design."}
{"id": "9922", "revid": "13514090", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9922", "title": "Societas Europaea", "text": "A societas Europaea ( ; \"European society\" or \"company\"; plural: ; abbr. SE) is a public company registered in accordance with the corporate law of the European Union (EU), introduced in 2004 with the Council Regulation on the Statute for a European Company. Such a company may more easily transfer to or merge with companies in other member states.\nAs of April 2018, more than 3,000 registrations have been reported, including the following nine components (18%) of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index of leading eurozone companies (excluding the SE designation): Airbus, Allianz, BASF, E.ON, Fresenius, LVMH Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton (and its parent company Dior), SAP, Schneider Electric and Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield.\nNational law continues to supplement the basic rules in the Regulation on formation and mergers. The European Company Regulation is complemented by an Employee Involvement Directive which manages the rules for participation by employees on the company's board of directors. There is also a statute allowing European Cooperative Societies.\nMain provisions.\nFormation.\nThe Statute provides four ways of forming a European limited company:\nFormation by merger is available only to public limited companies from different member states. Formation of an SE holding company is available to public and private limited companies with their registered offices in different member states or having subsidiaries or branches in member states other than that of their registered office. Formation of a joint subsidiary is available under the same circumstances to any legal entities governed by public or private law.\nMinimum capital.\nThe SE must have a minimum subscribed capital of \u20ac120,000 as per article 4(2) of the directive, subject to the provision that where a member state requires a larger capital for companies exercising certain types of activities, the same requirement will also apply to an SE with its registered office in that member state (article 4(3)).\nRegistered office.\nThe registered office of the SE designated in the statutes must be the place where it has its central administration, that is to say its true centre of operations. The SE may transfer its registered office within the European Economic Area without dissolving the company in one member state in order to form a new one in another member state; however, such a transfer is subject to the provisions of 8 which require, inter alia, the drawing up of a transfer proposal, a report justifying the legal and economic aspects of the transfer and the issuing, by the competent authority in the member state in which the SE is registered, of a certificate attesting to the completion of the required acts and formalities.\nLaws applicable.\nThe order of precedence of the laws applicable to the SE is clarified.\nRegistration and liquidation.\nThe registration and completion of the liquidation of an SE must be disclosed for information purposes in the Official Journal of the European Communities. Every SE must be registered in the State where it has its registered office, in a register designated by the law of that State.\nStatutes.\nThe Statutes of the SE must provide as governing bodies the annual general meeting of shareholders and either a management board and a supervisory board (two-tier system) or an administrative board (single-tier system). Under the two-tier system the SE is managed by a management board. The member or members of the management board have the power to represent the company in dealings with third parties and in legal proceedings. They are appointed and removed by the supervisory board. No person may be a member of both the management board and the supervisory board of the same company at the same time. But the supervisory board may appoint one of its members to exercise the functions of a member of the management board in the event of absence through holidays. During such a period the function of the person concerned as a member of the supervisory board shall be suspended. Under the single-tier system, the SE is managed by an administrative board. The member or members of the administrative board have the power to represent the company in dealings with third parties and in legal proceedings. Under the single-tier system the administrative board may delegate the power of management to one or more of its members.\nThe following operations require the authorization of the supervisory board or the deliberation of the administrative board:\nAnnual accounts.\nThe SE must draw up annual accounts comprising the balance sheet, the profit and loss account, and the notes to the accounts, and an annual report giving a fair view of the company's business and of its position; consolidated accounts may also be required.\nTaxation.\nIn tax matters, the SE is treated the same as any other multinational, i.e., it is subject to the tax regime of the national legislation applicable to the company and its subsidiaries. SEs are subject to taxes and charges in all member states where their administrative centres are situated. Thus, their tax status is not perfect as there is still no adequate harmonization at European level.\nWinding-up.\nWinding-up, liquidation, insolvency, and suspension of payments are in large measure to be governed by national law. When an SE transfers its registered office outside the Community, or in any other manner no longer complies with requirements of article 7, the member state must take appropriate measures to ensure compliance or take necessary measures to ensure that the SE is liquidated.\nStatus of the legislation and implementation.\nCouncil Regulation (EC) No 2157/2001 of 8 October 2001 on the Statute for a European company (SE).\nCouncil Directive 2001/86/EC of 8 October 2001 supplementing the Statute for a European company with regard to the involvement of employees.\nSee also: Europa's collection of press releases, regulations, directives and FAQs on the European Company Statute.\nUnited Kingdom.\nFollowing the withdrawal of the UK from the European Union, any SE registered in the United Kingdom converted to a United Kingdom \"Societas\" and UK Societas replaced SE in its name.\nEmployee participation.\nThe regulation is complemented by the Council Directive supplementing the Statute for a European Company with regard to the involvement of employees (informally \"Council Directive on Employee Participation\"), adopted 8 October 2001. The directive establishes rules on worker involvement in the management of the SE.\nEU member states differ in the degree of worker involvement in corporate management. In Germany, most large corporations are required to allow employees to elect a certain percentage of seats on the supervisory board. Other member states, such as the UK, have no such requirement, and furthermore in these states such practices are largely unknown and considered a threat to the rights of management.\nThese differing traditions of worker involvement have held back the adoption of the Statute for over a decade. States without worker involvement provisions were afraid that the SE might lead to having such provisions being imposed on their companies; and states with those provisions were afraid they might lead to those provisions being circumvented.\nA compromise, contained in the Directive, was worked out as follows: worker involvement provisions in the SE will be decided upon by negotiations between employees and management before the creation of the SE. If agreement cannot be reached, provisions contained in the Directive will apply. The Directive provides for worker involvement in the SE if a minimum percentage of employees from the entities coming together to form the SE enjoyed worker involvement provisions. The Directive permits member states to not implement these default worker involvement provisions in their national law, but then an SE cannot be created in that member state if the provisions in the Directive would apply and negotiations between workers and management are unsuccessful.\nDefinition.\nDefinition of employee participation: it does not mean participation in day-to-day decisions, which are a matter for the management, but participation in the supervision and strategic development of the company.\nEmployment contracts and pensions.\nEmployment contracts and pensions are not covered by the Directive. With regard to occupational pension schemes, the SE is covered by the provisions laid down in the proposal for a directive on institutions for occupational schemes, presented by the Commission in October 2000, in particular in connection with the possibility of introducing a single pension scheme for all their employees in the European Union.\nDevelopment.\nTwo approaches have been attempted to solve the problems cited above. One approach is to harmonize the company law of the member states. This approach has had some successes, but after thirty years only limited progress has been made. It is difficult to harmonize widely different regulatory systems, especially when they reflect different national attitudes to issues such as worker involvement in the management of the company.\nThe other approach is to construct a whole new system of EU company law, that co-exists with the individual company laws of the member states. Companies would have the choice of operating either under national regulations or under the EU-wide system. However, this approach has been only somewhat more effective than the harmonization approach: while states are not as concerned about having foreign traditions of corporate governance imposed on their companies, which the harmonization approach could well entail; they also wish to ensure that the EU-wide system would be palatable to the traditions of their national companies, so that they will not be put at a disadvantage compared to the other member states.\nThe European Company Statute represents a step in this direction, albeit a limited one. While it establishes some common EU rules on the SE, these rules are incomplete, and the holes in the rules are to be filled in using the law of the member state in which the SE is registered. This has been due to the difficulties of agreeing on common European rules on these issues.\nRegistrations.\nAs of 11 April 2018, 3,015 registrations have been made. In terms of registrations, the Czech Republic is vastly overrepresented, accounting for 79% of all \"Societates Europaeae\" as of December 2015. 9 of the 50 constituents of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index of leading eurozone companies are as of December 2015 \"Societates Europaeae\".\nAnnual registrations by member state are presented in the following chart:\nRegistrations of new \"societates\" are to be published in the \"Official Journal of the European Union\". There is no official union-wide register of \"societates\", as they are registered in the nation in which their corporate seats are located. \"worker-participation.eu\" does however maintain a database of current and planned registrations.

{"id": "9924", "revid": "9784415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9924", "title": "Electronic mixer", "text": "An electronic mixer is a device that combines two or more electrical or electronic signals into one or two composite output signals. There are two basic circuits that both use the term \"mixer\", but they are very different types of circuits: additive mixers and multiplicative mixers. Additive mixers are also known as \"analog adders\" to distinguish from the related digital adder circuits.\nSimple additive mixers use Kirchhoff's circuit laws to add the currents of two or more signals together, and this terminology (\"mixer\") is only used in the realm of audio electronics where audio mixers are used to add together audio signals such as voice signals, music signals, and sound effects.\nMultiplicative mixers multiply together two time-varying input signals instantaneously (instant-by-instant). If the two input signals are both sinusoids of specified frequencies f1 and f2, then the output of the mixer will contain two new sinusoids that have the sum f1 + f2 frequency and the difference frequency absolute value |f1 - f2|.\nAny nonlinear electronic block driven by two signals with frequencies f1 and f2 would generate intermodulation (mixing) products. A multiplier (which is a nonlinear device) will generate ideally only the sum and difference frequencies, whereas an arbitrary nonlinear block will also generate signals at 2\u00b7f1-3\u00b7f2, etc. Therefore, normal nonlinear amplifiers or just single diodes have been used as mixers, instead of a more complex multiplier. A multiplier usually has the advantage of rejecting \u2013 at least partly \u2013 undesired higher-order intermodulations and larger conversion gain.\nAdditive mixers.\nAdditive mixers add two or more signals, giving out a composite signal that contains the frequency components of each of the source signals. The simplest additive mixers are resistor networks, and thus purely passive, while more complex matrix mixers employ active components such as buffer amplifiers for impedance matching and better isolation.\nMultiplicative mixers.\nAn ideal multiplicative mixer produces an output signal equal to the product of the two input signals. In communications, a multiplicative mixer is often used together with an oscillator to modulate signal frequencies. A multiplicative mixer can be coupled with a filter to either up-convert or down-convert an input signal frequency, but they are more commonly used to down-convert to a lower frequency to allow for simpler filter designs, as done in superheterodyne receivers. In many typical circuits, the single output signal actually contains multiple waveforms, namely those at the sum and difference of the two input frequencies and harmonic waveforms. The output signal may be obtained by removing the other signal components with a filter.\u00ed\nMathematical treatment.\nThe received signal can be represented as\nand that of the local oscillator can be represented as\nFor simplicity, assume that the output \"I\" of the detector is proportional to the square of the amplitude:\nThe output has high frequency (formula_9, formula_10 and formula_11) and constant components. In heterodyne detection, the high frequency components and usually the constant components are filtered out, leaving the intermediate (beat) frequency at formula_12. The amplitude of this last component is proportional to the amplitude of the signal radiation. With appropriate signal analysis the phase of the signal can be recovered as well.\nIf formula_13 is equal to formula_14 then the beat component is a recovered version of the original signal, with the amplitude equal to the product of formula_15 and formula_16; that is, the received signal is amplified by mixing with the local oscillator. This is the basis for a Direct conversion receiver.\nImplementations.\nMultiplicative mixers have been implemented in many ways. The most popular are Gilbert cell mixers, diode mixers, diode ring mixers (ring modulation) and switching mixers. Diode mixers take advantage of the non-linearity of diode devices to produce the desired multiplication in the squared term. They are very inefficient as most of the power output is in other unwanted terms which need filtering out. Inexpensive AM radios still use diode mixers.\nElectronic mixers are usually made with transistors and/or diodes arranged in a balanced circuit or even a double-balanced circuit. They are readily manufactured as monolithic integrated circuits or hybrid integrated circuits. They are designed for a wide variety of frequency ranges, and they are mass-produced to tight tolerances by the hundreds of thousands, making them relatively cheap.\nDouble-balanced mixers are very widely used in microwave communications, satellite communications, ultrahigh frequency (UHF) communications transmitters, radio receivers, and radar systems.\nGilbert cell mixers are an arrangement of transistors that multiplies the two signals.\nSwitching mixers use arrays of field-effect transistors or vacuum tubes. These are used as electronic switches, to alternate the signal direction. They are controlled by the signal being mixed. They are especially popular with digitally controlled radios. Switching mixers pass more power and usually insert less distortion than Gilbert cell mixers."}

He is famous for his paradoxes.\nLife.\nEubulides was a pupil of Euclid of Megara, the founder of the Megarian school. He was a contemporary of Aristotle, against whom he wrote with great bitterness. He taught logic to Demosthenes, and he is also said to have taught Apollonius Cronus, the teacher of Diodorus Cronus, and the historian Euphantus. He may have been the author of a book about Diogenes of Sinope.\nParadoxes of Eubulides.\nEubulides is most famous for inventing the forms of seven famous paradoxes, some of which, however, are also ascribed to Diodorus Cronus:\nThe first paradox (the Liar) is probably the most famous, and is similar to the famous paradox of Epimenides the Cretan. The second, third and fourth paradoxes are variants of a single paradox and relate to the problem of what it means to \"know\" something and the identity of objects involved in an affirmation (compare the masked-man fallacy). The fifth and sixth paradoxes are also a single paradox and is usually thought to relate to the vagueness of language. The final paradox attacks presumptions involved in a proposition, and is related to the syllogistic fallacy.\nThese paradoxes were very well known in ancient times, some are alluded to by Eubulides' contemporary Aristotle and even partially by Plato. Aulus Gellius mentions how the discussion of such paradoxes was considered (for him) after-dinner entertainment at the Saturnalia, but Seneca, on the other hand, considered them a waste of time: \"Not to know them does no harm, and mastering them does no good.\""}
{"id": "9926", "revid": "20931057", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9926", "title": "ETA (separatist group)", "text": "ETA, an acronym for Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (\"Basque Homeland and Liberty\" or \"Basque Country and Freedom\"), was an armed Basque nationalist and separatist organization in the Basque Country (in northern Spain and southwestern France). The group was founded in 1959 and later evolved from a group promoting traditional Basque culture to a paramilitary group engaged in a violent campaign of bombing, assassinations and kidnappings in the Southern Basque Country and throughout Spanish territory. Its goal was gaining independence for the Basque Country. ETA was the main group within the Basque National Liberation Movement and was the most important Basque participant in the Basque conflict.\nBetween 1968 and 2010, it killed 829 people (including 340 civilians) and injured thousands more. ETA was classified as a terrorist group by Spain, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and the European Union. This convention was followed by a plurality of domestic and international media, which also referred to the group as terrorists. There are more than 260 imprisoned former members of the group in Spain, France, and other countries.\nETA declared ceasefires in 1989, 1996, 1998 and 2006. On 5 September 2010, ETA declared a new ceasefire that remained in force, and on 20 October 2011, ETA announced a \"definitive cessation of its armed activity\". On 24 November 2012, it was reported that the group was ready to negotiate a \"definitive end\" to its operations and disband completely. The group announced on 7 April 2017 that it had given up all its weapons and explosives. On 2 May 2018, ETA made public a letter dated to 16 April 2018 according to which it had \"completely dissolved all its structures and ended its political initiative\".\nETA's motto was (\"Keep up on both\"), referring to the two figures in its symbol, a snake (representing politics) wrapped around an axe (representing armed struggle).\nStructure.\nETA changed its internal structure on several occasions, commonly for security reasons. The group used to have a very hierarchical organization with a leading figure at the top, delegating into three substructures: the logistical, military and political sections. Reports from Spanish and French police point towards significant changes in ETA's structures in its later years. ETA divided the three substructures into a total of eleven. The change was a response to captures, and possible infiltration, by the different law enforcement agencies. ETA intended to disperse its members and reduce the effects of detentions.\nThe leading committee comprised 7 to 11 individuals, and ETA's internal documentation referred to it as Zuba, an abbreviation of \"Zuzendaritza Batzordea\" (directorial committee). There was another committee named \"Zuba-hits\" that functioned as an advisory committee. The eleven different substructures were: logistics, politics, international relations with fraternal organisations, military operations, reserves, prisoner support, expropriation, information, recruitment, negotiation, and treasury.\nETA's armed operations were organized in different \"tales\" (groups or commandos), generally composed of three to five members, whose objective was to conduct attacks in a specific geographic zone. The \"tales\" were coordinated by the \"c\u00fapula Militar\" (\"military cupola\"). To supply the \"tales\", support groups maintained safe houses and \"zulos\" (small rooms concealed in forests, garrets or underground, used to store arms, explosives or, sometimes, kidnapped people; the Basque word \"zulo\" literally means \"hole\"). The small cellars used to hide the people kidnapped are named by ETA and ETA's supporters \"people's jails\". The most common \"commandos\" were itinerant, not linked to any specific area, and thus were more difficult to capture.\nAmong its members, ETA distinguished between \"legales/legal\" (\"legal ones\"), those members who did not have police records and lived apparently normal lives; \"liberators\" (\"liberated\") members known to the police that were on ETA's payroll and working full-time for ETA; and \"apoyos\" (\"support\") who just gave occasional help and logistics support to the group when required.\nThere were also imprisoned members of the group, serving time scattered across Spain and France, that sometimes still had significant influence inside the organisation; and finally the \"quemados\" (\"burnt out\"), members freed after having been imprisoned or those that were suspected by the group of being under police vigilance. In the past, there was also the figure of the deportees, expelled by the French government to remote countries where they lived freely. ETA's internal bulletin was named \"Zutabe\" (\"Column\"), replacing the earlier one (1962) \"Zutik\" (\"Standing\").\nETA also promoted the \"kale borroka\" (\"street fight\"), that is, violent acts against public transportation, political parties' offices or cultural buildings, destruction of private property of politicians, police, military, bank offices, journalists, council members, and anyone voicing criticism against ETA. Tactics included threats, graffiti of political mottoes, and rioting, usually using Molotov cocktails. These groups were mostly made up of young people, who were directed through youth organisations (such as Jarrai, Haika and Segi). Many members of ETA started their collaboration with the group as participants in the \"kale borroka\".\nPolitical support.\nThe former political party Batasuna, disbanded in 2003, pursued the same political goals as ETA and did not condemn ETA's use of violence. Formerly known as Euskal Herritarrok and \"Herri Batasuna\", it was banned by the Spanish Supreme Court as an anti-democratic organisation following the Political Parties Law (\"Ley de Partidos Pol\u00edticos\"). It generally received 10% to 20% of the vote in the Basque Autonomous Community.\nBatasuna's political status was controversial. It was considered to be the political wing of ETA. Moreover, after the investigations on the nature of the relationship between Batasuna and ETA by Judge Baltasar Garz\u00f3n, who suspended the activities of the political organisation and ordered police to shut down its headquarters, the Supreme Court of Spain finally declared Batasuna illegal on 18 March 2003. The court considered proven that Batasuna had links with ETA and that it constituted in fact part of ETA's structure. In 2003, the Constitutional Tribunal upheld the legality of the law.\nHowever, the party itself denied being the political wing of ETA, although double membership \u2013 simultaneous or alternative \u2013 between Batasuna and ETA was often recorded, such as with the cases of prominent Batasuna leaders like Josu Ternera, Arnaldo Otegi, Jon Salaberria and others.\nThe Spanish Cortes (the Spanish Parliament) began the process of declaring the party illegal in August 2002 by issuing a bill entitled the \"Ley de Partidos Pol\u00edticos\" which bars political parties that use violence to achieve political goals, promote hatred against different groups or seek to destroy the democratic system. The bill passed the Cortes with a 304 to 16 vote. Many within the Basque nationalistic movement strongly disputed the Law, which they considered too draconian or even unconstitutional; alleging that any party could be made illegal almost by choice, simply for not clearly stating their opposition to an attack.\nDefenders of the law argued that the \"Ley de Partidos\" did not necessarily require responses to individual acts of violence, but rather a declaration of principles explicitly rejecting violence as a means of achieving political goals. Defenders also argued that the ban of a political party is subject to judicial process, with all the guarantees of the State of Law. Batasuna had failed to produce such a statement. other political parties linked to organizations such as \"Partido Comunista de Espa\u00f1a (reconstituted)\" have also been declared illegal, and Acci\u00f3n Nacionalista Vasca and Communist Party of the Basque Lands (EHAK/PCTV, \"Euskal Herrialdeetako Alderdi Komunista/Partido Comunista de las Tierras Vascas\") was declared illegal in September 2008.\nA new party called Aukera Guztiak \"(All the Options)\" was formed expressly for the elections to the Basque Parliament of April 2005. Its supporters claimed no heritage from Batasuna, asserting that they aimed to allow Basque citizens to freely express their political ideas, even those of independence. On the matter of political violence, Aukera Guztiak stated their right not to condemn some kinds of violence more than others if they did not see fit (in this regard, the Basque National Liberation Movement (MLNV) regards present police actions as violence, torture and state terrorism). Nevertheless, most of their members and certainly most of their leadership were former Batasuna supporters or affiliates. The Spanish Supreme Court unanimously considered the party to be a successor to Batasuna and declared a ban on it.\nAfter Aukera Guztiak had been banned, and less than two weeks before the election, another political group appeared born from an earlier schism from Herri Batasuna, the Communist Party of the Basque Lands (EHAK/PCTV, \"Euskal Herrialdeetako Alderdi Komunista/Partido Comunista de las Tierras Vascas\"), a formerly unknown political party which had no representation in the Autonomous Basque Parliament. EHAK announced that they would apply the votes they obtained to sustain the political programme of the now-banned Aukera Guztiak platform.\nThis move left no time for the Spanish courts to investigate EHAK in compliance with the \"Ley de Partidos\" before the elections were held. The bulk of Batasuna supporters voted in this election for PCTV. It obtained 9 seats of 75 (12.44% of votes) in the Basque Parliament.\nThe election of EHAK representatives eventually allowed the programme of the now-illegal Batasuna to continue being represented without having condemned violence as required by the \"Ley de Partidos\".\nIn February 2011, Sortu, a party described as \"the new Batasuna\", was launched. Unlike predecessor parties, Sortu explicitly rejects politically motivated violence, including that of ETA. However, on 23 March 2011, the Spanish Supreme Court banned Sortu from registering as a political party on the grounds that it was linked to ETA.\nSocial support.\nThe Spanish transition to democracy from 1975 on and ETA's progressive radicalisation had resulted in a steady loss of support, which became especially apparent at the time of their 1997 kidnapping and countdown assassination of Miguel \u00c1ngel Blanco. Their loss of sympathisers had been reflected in an erosion of support for the political parties identified with them. In the 1998 Basque parliament elections Euskal Herritarrok, formerly Batasuna, polled 17.7% of the votes. However, by 2001 the party's support had fallen to 10.0%. There were also concerns that Spain's \"judicial offensive\" against alleged ETA supporters (two Basque political parties and one NGO were banned in September 2008) constituted a threat to human rights. Strong evidence was seen that a legal network had grown so wide as to lead to the arrest of numerous innocent people. According to Amnesty International, torture was still \"persistent\", though not \"systematic\". Inroads could be undermined by judicial short-cuts and abuses of human rights.\nOpinion polls.\nThe Euskobarometro, the survey carried out by the Universidad del Pa\u00eds Vasco (University of the Basque Country), asking about the views of ETA within the Basque population, obtained these results in May 2009: 64% rejected ETA totally, 13% identified themselves as former ETA sympathisers who no longer support the group. Another 10% agreed with ETA's ends, but not their means. 3% said that their attitude towards ETA was mainly one of fear, 3% expressed indifference and 3% were undecided or did not answer. About 3% gave ETA \"justified, with criticism\" support (supporting the group but criticising some of their actions) and only 1% gave ETA total support. Even within Batasuna voters, at least 48% rejected ETA's violence.\nA poll taken by the Basque Autonomous Government in December 2006 during ETA's \"permanent\" ceasefire showed that 88% of the Basques thought that all political parties needed to launch a dialogue, including a debate on the political framework for the Basque Country (86%). 69% support the idea of ratifying the results of this hypothetical multiparty dialogue through a referendum. This poll also reveals that the hope of a peaceful resolution to the issue of the constitutional status of the Basque region has fallen to 78% (from 90% in April).\nThese polls did not cover Navarre, where support for Basque nationalist electoral options is weaker (around 25% of the population); or the Northern Basque Country, where support is even weaker (around 15% of the population).\nHistory.\nDuring Franco's dictatorship.\nETA grew out of a student group called Ekin, founded in the early 1950s, which published a magazine and undertook direct action. ETA was founded on 31 July 1959 as Euskadi Ta Askatasuna (\"Basque Homeland and Liberty\" or \"Basque Country and Freedom\") by students frustrated by the moderate stance of the Basque Nationalist Party. (Originally, the name for the organisation used the word \"Aberri\" instead of \"Euskadi\", creating the acronym \"ATA\". However, in some Basque dialects, \"ata\" means \"duck\", so the name was changed.)\nETA held their first assembly in Bayonne, France, in 1962, during which a \"declaration of principles\" was formulated and following which a structure of activist cells was developed. Subsequently, Marxist and third-worldist perspectives developed within ETA, becoming the basis for a political programme set out in Federico Krutwig's 1963 book \"Vasconia\", which is considered to be the defining text of the movement. In contrast to previous Basque nationalist platforms, Krutwig's vision was anti-religious and based upon language and culture rather than race. ETA's third and fourth assemblies, held in 1964 and 1965, adopted an anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist position, seeing nationalism and the class struggle as intrinsically connected.\nSome sources attributed the 1960 bombing of the Amara station in Donostia-San Sebastian (which killed a 22-month-old child) to ETA, but statistics published by the Spanish Ministry of the Interior have always showed that ETA's first victim was killed in 1968. The 1960 attack was claimed by the Portuguese and Galician left-wing group Directorio Revolucionario Ib\u00e9rico de Liberaci\u00f3n (DRIL) (together with four other very similar bombings committed that same day across Spain, all of them attributed to DRIL), and the attribution to ETA has been considered to be unfounded by researchers. Police documents dating from 1961, released in 2013, show that the DRIL was indeed the author of the bombing. A more recent study by the \"Memorial de V\u00edctimas del Terrorismo\" based on the analysis of police diligences at the time reached the same conclusion, naming Guillermo Santoro, member of DRIL, as the author of the attack. \nETA's first killing occurred on 7 June 1968, when Guardia Civil member Jos\u00e9 Pardines Arcay was shot dead after he tried to halt ETA member Txabi Etxebarrieta during a routine road check. Etxebarrieta was chased down and killed as he tried to flee. This led to retaliation in the form of the first planned ETA assassination: that of Melit\u00f3n Manzanas, chief of the secret police in San Sebasti\u00e1n and associated with a long record of tortures inflicted on detainees in his custody. In December 1970, several members of ETA were condemned to death in the Burgos trials (\"Proceso de Burgos\"), but international pressure resulted in their sentences being commuted (a process which, however, had by that time already been applied to some other members of ETA).\nIn early December 1970, ETA kidnapped the German consul in San Sebastian, Eugen Beilh, to exchange him for the Burgos defendants. He was released unharmed on 24 December.\nNationalists who refused to follow the tenets of Marxism\u2013Leninism and who sought to create a united front appeared as ETA-V, but lacked the support to challenge ETA.\nThe most significant assassination performed by ETA during Franco's dictatorship was Operaci\u00f3n Ogro, the December 1973 bomb assassination in Madrid of Admiral Luis Carrero Blanco, Franco's chosen successor and president of the government (a position roughly equivalent to being a prime minister). The assassination had been planned for months and was executed by placing a bomb in a tunnel dug below the street where Carrero Blanco's car passed every day. The bomb blew up beneath the politician's car and left a massive crater in the road.\nFor some in the Spanish opposition, Carrero Blanco's assassination, i.e., the elimination of Franco's chosen successor was an instrumental step for the subsequent re-establishment of democracy. The government responded with new anti-terrorism laws which gave police greater powers and empowered military tribunals to pass death sentences against those found guilty. However, the last use of capital punishment in Spain when two ETA members were executed in September 1975, eight weeks before Franco's death, sparked massive domestic and international protests against the Spanish government.\nDuring the transition.\nDuring the Spanish transition to democracy which began following Franco's death, ETA split into two separate groups: ETA political-military or ETA(pm), and ETA military or ETA(m).\nBoth ETA(m) and ETA(pm) refused offers of amnesty, and instead pursued and intensified their violent struggle. The years 1978\u20131980 were to prove ETA's most deadly, with 68, 76, and 98 fatalities, respectively.\nDuring the Franco dictatorship, ETA was able to take advantage of tolerance by the French government, which allowed its members to move freely through French territory, believing that in this manner they were contributing to the end of Franco's regime. There is much controversy over the degree to which this policy of \"sanctuary\" continued even after the transition to democracy, but it is generally agreed that later the French authorities collaborated closely with the Spanish government against ETA.\nIn the 1980s, ETA(pm) accepted the Spanish government's offer of individual pardons to all ETA prisoners, even those who had committed violent crimes, who publicly abandoned the policy of violence. This caused a new division in ETA(pm) between the seventh and eighth assemblies. ETA VII accepted this partial amnesty granted by the now democratic Spanish government and integrated into the political party \"Euskadiko Ezkerra\" (\"Left of the Basque Country\").\nETA VIII, after a brief period of independent activity, eventually integrated into ETA(m). With no factions existing anymore, ETA(m) reclaimed the original name of Euskadi Ta Askatasuna.\nGAL.\nDuring the 1980s a \"dirty war\" ensued using the Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberaci\u00f3n (GAL, \"Antiterrorist Liberation Groups\"), a paramilitary group which billed themselves as counter-terrorist, active between 1983 and 1987. The GAL committed assassinations, kidnappings and torture, not only of ETA members but of civilians supposedly related to those, some of whom turned out to have nothing to do with ETA. 27 people were killed by GAL. GAL activities were a follow-up of similar dirty war actions by death squads, actively supported by members of Spanish security forces and secret services, using names such as active from 1975 to 1981. They were responsible for the killing of about 48 people.\nOne consequence of GAL's activities in France was the decision in 1984 by interior minister Pierre Joxe to permit the extradition of ETA suspects to Spain. Reaching this decision had taken 25 years and was critical in curbing ETA's capabilities by denial of previously safe territory in France.\nThe airing of the state-sponsored \"dirty war\" scheme and the imprisonment of officials responsible for GAL in the early 1990s led to a political scandal in Spain. The group's connections with the state were unveiled by the Spanish journal , with an investigative series leading to the GAL plot being discovered and a national trial initiated. As a consequence, the group's attacks since the revelation have generally been dubbed state terrorism.\nIn 1997 the Spanish court finished its trial, which resulted in convictions and imprisonment of several individuals related to the GAL, including civil servants and politicians up to the highest levels of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE) government, such as former Homeland Minister Jos\u00e9 Barrionuevo. Premier Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez was quoted as saying that the constitutional state has to defend itself \"even in the sewers\" (), something which, for some, indicated at least his knowledge of the scheme. However, his involvement with the GAL could never be proven.\nThese events marked the end of the armed \"counter-terrorist\" period in Spain and no major cases of foul play on the part of the Spanish government after 1987 (when GAL ceased to operate) have been proven in courts.\nHuman rights.\nAccording to the radical nationalist group, Euskal Memoria, between 1960 and 2010 there were 465 deaths in the Basque Country due to (primarily Spanish) \"state violence\". This figure is considerably higher than those given elsewhere, which are usually between 250 and 300. Critics of ETA cite only 56 members of that organisation killed by state forces since 1975.\nETA members and supporters routinely claim torture at the hands of Spanish police forces. While these claims are hard to verify, some convictions were based on confessions while prisoners were held incommunicado and without access to a lawyer of their choice, for a maximum of five days. These confessions were routinely repudiated by the defendants during trials as having been extracted under torture. There were some successful prosecutions of proven tortures during the \"dirty war\" period of the mid-1980s, although the penalties have been considered by Amnesty International as unjustifiably light and lenient with co-conspirators and enablers.\nIn this regard, Amnesty International showed concern for the continuous disregard of the recommendations issued by the agency to prevent the alleged abuses from possibly taking place. Also in this regard, ETA's manuals were found instructing its members and supporters to claim routinely that they had been tortured while detained. Unai Romano's case was very controversial: pictures of him with a symmetrically swollen face of uncertain aetiology were published after his incommunicado period leading to claims of police abuse and torture. Martxelo Otamendi, the ex-director of the Basque newspaper , decided to bring charges in September 2008 against the Spanish Government in the European Court of Human Rights for \"not inspecting properly\" cases tainted by torture.\nAs a result of ETA's violence, threats and killings of journalists, Reporters Without Borders included Spain in all six editions of its annual watchlist on press freedom up to 2006. Thus, the NGO included ETA in its watchlist \"Predators of Press Freedom\".\nUnder democracy.\nETA performed their first car bomb assassination in Madrid in September 1985, resulting in one death (American citizen Eugene Kent Brown, employee of Johnson &amp; Johnson) and sixteen injuries; the Plaza Rep\u00fablica Dominicana bombing in July 1986 killed 12 members of the Guardia Civil and injured 50; on 19 June 1987, the Hipercor bombing was an attack in a shopping centre in Barcelona, killing 21 and injuring 45; in the last case, entire families were killed. The horror caused then was so striking that ETA felt compelled to issue a communiqu\u00e9 stating that they had given warning of the Hipercor bomb, but that the police had declined to evacuate the area. The police said that the warning came only a few minutes before the bomb exploded. \nIn 1986 (known in English as Association for Peace in the Basque Country) was founded; they began to convene silent demonstrations in communities throughout the Basque Country the day after any violent killing, whether by ETA or by GAL. These were the first systematic demonstrations in the Basque Country against political violence. Also in 1986, in Ordizia, ETA gunned down Mar\u00eda Dolores Katarain, known as \"Yoyes\", while she was walking with her infant son. Yoyes was a former member of ETA who had abandoned the armed struggle and rejoined civil society: they accused her of \"desertion\" because of her taking advantage of the Spanish reinsertion policy which granted amnesty to those prisoners who publicly renounced political violence (see below).\nOn 12 January 1988, all Basque political parties except ETA-affiliated Herri Batasuna signed the Ajuria-Enea pact with the intent of ending ETA's violence. Weeks later on 28 January, ETA announced a 60-day \"ceasefire\", later prolonged several times. Negotiations known as the (\"Algiers Table\") took place between the ETA representative Eugenio Etxebeste (\"Antxon\") and the then PSOE government of Spain, but no successful conclusion was reached, and ETA eventually resumed the use of violence.\nDuring this period, the Spanish government had a policy referred to as \"reinsertion\", under which imprisoned ETA members whom the government believed had genuinely abandoned violence could be freed and allowed to rejoin society. Claiming a need to prevent ETA from coercively impeding this reinsertion, the PSOE government decided that imprisoned ETA members, who previously had all been imprisoned within the Basque Country, would instead be dispersed to prisons throughout Spain, some as far from their families as in the Salto del Negro prison in the Canary Islands. France has taken a similar approach.\nIn the event, the only clear effect of this policy was to incite social protest, especially from nationalists and families of the prisoners, claiming cruelty of separating family members from the insurgents. Much of the protest against this policy runs under the slogan (\"Basque prisoners to the Basque Country\"; by \"Basque prisoners\" only ETA members are meant). It has to be noted that almost in any Spanish jail there is a group of ETA prisoners, as the number of ETA prisoners makes it difficult to disperse them.\n\"/\" (\"Pro-Amnesty Managing Assemblies\", currently illegal), later (\"Freedom\") and (\"The Family Members\"), provided support for prisoners and families. The Basque Government and several Nationalist town halls granted money on humanitarian reasons for relatives to visit prisoners. The long road trips have caused accidental deaths that are protested against by Nationalist Prisoner's Family supporters.\nDuring the ETA ceasefire of the late 1990s, the PSOE government brought the prisoners on the islands and in Africa back to the mainland. Since the end of the ceasefire, ETA prisoners have not been sent back to overseas prisons. Some Basque authorities have established grants for the expenses of visiting families.\nAnother Spanish \"counter-terrorist\" law puts suspected terrorist cases under the central tribunal in Madrid, due to the threats by the group over the Basque courts. Under Article 509 suspected terrorists are subject to being held incommunicado for up to thirteen days, during which they have no contact with the outside world other than through the court-appointed lawyer, including informing their family of their arrest, consultation with private lawyers or examination by a physician other than the coroners. In comparison, the habeas corpus term for other suspects is three days.\nIn 1992, ETA's three top leaders\u2014\"military\" leader Francisco Mujika Garmendia (\"Pakito\"), political leader Jos\u00e9 Luis Alvarez Santacristina (\"Txelis\") and logistical leader Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Arregi Erostarbe (\"Fiti\"), often referred to collectively as the \"c\u00fapula\" of ETA or as the Artapalo collective\u2014were arrested in the northern Basque town of Bidart, which led to changes in ETA's leadership and direction.\nAfter a two-month truce, ETA adopted even more radical positions. The principal consequence of the change appears to have been the creation of the \"Y Groups\", formed by young militants of ETA parallel groups (generally minors), dedicated to so-called \u2014street struggle\u2014and whose activities included burning buses, street lamps, benches, ATMs, and garbage containers, and throwing Molotov cocktails. The appearance of these groups was attributed by many to the supposed weakness of ETA, which obliged them to resort to minors to maintain or augment their impact on society after arrests of leading militants, including the \"cupola\". ETA also began to menace leaders of other parties besides rival Basque nationalist parties.\nIn 1995, the armed group again launched a peace proposal. The so-called \"Democratic Alternative\" replaced the earlier KAS Alternative as a minimum proposal for the establishment of Euskal Herria. The Democratic Alternative offered the cessation of all armed ETA activity if the Spanish government would recognize the Basque people as having sovereignty over Basque territory, the right to self-determination, and that it freed all ETA members in prison. The Spanish government ultimately rejected this peace offer as it would go against the Spanish Constitution of 1978. Changing the constitution was not considered.\nAlso in 1995 was a failed ETA car bombing attempt directed against Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar, a conservative politician who was the leader of the then-opposition (PP) and was shortly after elected to the presidency of the government; there was also an abortive attempt in Majorca on the life of King Juan Carlos\u00a0I. Still, the act with the largest social impact came the following year. On 10 July 1997, PP council member Miguel \u00c1ngel Blanco was kidnapped in the Basque town of Ermua, with the separatist group threatening to assassinate him unless the Spanish government met ETA's demand of starting to bring all ETA's inmates to prisons of the Basque Country within two days after the kidnapping.\nThis demand was not met by the Spanish government and after three days Miguel \u00c1ngel Blanco was found shot dead when the deadline expired. More than six million people took out to the streets to demand his liberation, with massive demonstrations occurring as much in the Basque regions as elsewhere in Spain, chanting cries of \"Assassins\" and \"Basques yes, ETA no\". This response came to be known as the \"Spirit of Ermua\".\nLater acts of violence included the 6 November 2001 car bomb in Madrid which injured 65 people, and attacks on football stadiums and tourist destinations throughout Spain.\nThe 11 September 2001 attacks in the US appeared to have dealt a hard blow to ETA, owing to the worldwide toughening of \"anti-terrorist\" measures (such as the freezing of bank accounts), the increase in international policy coordination, and the end of the toleration some countries had, up until then, extended to ETA. Additionally, in 2002 the Basque nationalist youth movement, \"Jarrai\", was outlawed and the law of parties was changed outlawing Herri Batasuna, the \"political arm\" of ETA (although even before the change in law, Batasuna had been largely paralysed and under judicial investigation by judge Baltasar Garz\u00f3n).\nWith ever-increasing frequency, attempted ETA actions were frustrated by Spanish security forces.\nOn 24 December 2003, in San Sebasti\u00e1n and in Hernani, National Police arrested two ETA members who had left dynamite in a railroad car prepared to explode in Chamart\u00edn Station in Madrid. On 1 March 2004, in a place between Alcal\u00e1 de Henares and Madrid, a light truck with 536\u00a0kg of explosives was discovered by the Guardia Civil.\nETA was initially blamed for the 2004 Madrid bombings by the outgoing government and large sections of the press. However, the group denied responsibility and Islamic fundamentalists from Morocco were eventually convicted. The judicial investigation currently states that there is no relationship between ETA and the Madrid bombings.\n2006 ceasefire declaration and subsequent discontinuation.\nIn the context of negotiation with the Spanish government, ETA declared what it described as a \"truce\" several times since its creation.\nOn 22 March 2006, ETA sent a DVD message to the Basque Network Euskal Irrati-Telebista and the journals \"Gara\" and \"Berria\" with a communiqu\u00e9 from the group announcing what it called a \"permanent ceasefire\" that was broadcast over Spanish TV.\nTalks with the group were then officially opened by Spanish \"Presidente del Gobierno\" Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero.\nThese took place all over 2006, not free from incidents such as an ETA cell stealing some 300 handguns, ammunition and spare parts in France in October 2006. or a series of warnings made by ETA such as the one of 23 September, when masked ETA militants declared that the group would \"keep taking up arms\" until achieving \"independence and socialism in the Basque country\", which were regarded by some as a way to increase pressure on the talks, by others as a tactic to reinforce ETA's position in the negotiations.\nFinally, on 30 December 2006 ETA detonated a van bomb after three confusing warning calls, in a parking building at the Madrid Barajas international airport. The explosion caused the collapse of the building and killed two Ecuadorian immigrants who were napping inside their cars in the parking building. At 6:00\u00a0pm, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero released a statement stating that the \"peace process\" had been discontinued.\n2008 to present.\nIn January 2008, ETA stated that its call for independence is similar to that of the Kosovo status and Scotland. In the week of 8 September 2008, two Basque political parties were banned by a Spanish court for their secretive links to ETA. In another case in the same week, 21 people were convicted whose work on behalf of ETA prisoners actually belied secretive links to the armed separatists themselves. ETA reacted to these actions by placing three major car bombs in less than 24 hours in northern Spain.\nIn April 2009 Jurdan Martitegi was arrested, making him the fourth consecutive ETA military chief to be captured within a single year, an unprecedented police record, further weakening the group. Violence surged in the middle of 2009, with several ETA attacks leaving three people dead and dozens injured around Spain.\nThe Basque newspaper \"Gara\" published an article that suggested that ETA member Jon Anza could have been killed and buried by Spanish police in April 2009. The central prosecutor in the French town of Bayonne, Anne Kayanakis, announced, as the official version, that the autopsy carried out on the body of Jon Anza \u2013 a suspected member of the armed Basque group ETA, missing since April 2009 \u2013 revealed no signs of having been beaten, wounded or shot, which should rule out any suspicions that he died from unnatural causes. Nevertheless, that very magistrate denied the demand of the family asking for the presence of a family doctor during the autopsy. After this, Jon Anza's family members asked for a second autopsy to be carried out.\nIn December 2009, Spain raised its terror alert after warning that ETA could be planning major attacks or high-profile kidnappings during Spain's European Union presidency. The next day, after being asked by the opposition, Alfredo P\u00e9rez Rubalcaba said that warning was part of a strategy.\n2010 ceasefire.\nOn 5 September 2010, ETA declared a new ceasefire, its third after two previous ceasefires were ended by the group. A spokesperson speaking on a video announcing the ceasefire said the group wished to use \"peaceful, democratic means\" to achieve its aims, though it was not specified whether the ceasefire was considered permanent by the group. ETA claimed that it had decided to initiate a ceasefire several months before the announcement. In the part of the video, the spokesperson said that the group was \"prepared today as yesterday to agree to the minimum democratic conditions necessary to put in motion a democratic process if the Spanish government is willing\".\nThe announcement was met with a mixed reaction; Basque nationalist politicians responded positively and said that the Spanish and international governments should do the same, while the Spanish interior counsellor of Basque, Rodolfo Ares, said that the committee did not go far enough. He said that he considered ETA's statement \"absolutely insufficient\" because it did not commit to a complete termination of what Ares considered \"terrorist activity\" by the group.\n2011 permanent ceasefire and cessation of armed activity.\nOn 10 January 2011, ETA declared that their September 2010 ceasefire would be permanent and verifiable by international observers. Observers urged caution, pointing out that ETA had broken permanent ceasefires in the past, whereas Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero (who left office in December 2011) demanded that ETA declare that it had given up violence once and for all. After the declaration, Spanish press started speculating of a possible Real IRA-type split within ETA, with hardliners forming a new more violent offshoot led by \"Dienteputo\".\nOn 21 October 2011, ETA announced a cessation of armed activity via video clip sent to media outlets following the Donostia-San Sebasti\u00e1n International Peace Conference, which was attended by former UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, former Taoiseach of Ireland Bertie Ahern, former Prime Minister of Norway Gro Harlem Brundtland (an international leader in sustainable development and public health), former Interior Minister of France Pierre Joxe, president of Sinn F\u00e9in Gerry Adams (a Teachta D\u00e1la in D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann), and British diplomat Jonathan Powell, who served as the first Downing Street Chief of Staff.\nThey all signed a final declaration that was supported also by former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair, the former US president and 2002 Nobel Peace Prize winner Jimmy Carter, and the former US senator and former US Special Envoy for Middle East Peace George J. Mitchell. The meeting did not include Spanish or French government representatives.\nThe day after the ceasefire, in a contribution piece to \"The New York Times\", Tony Blair indicated that lessons in dealing with paramilitary separatist groups can be learned from how the Spanish administration handled ETA. Blair wrote, \"governments must firmly defend themselves, their principles and their people against terrorists. This requires good police and intelligence work as well as political determination. [However], firm security pressure on terrorists must be coupled with offering them a way out when they realize that they cannot win by violence. Terrorist groups are rarely defeated by military means alone\". Blair also suggested that Spain would need to discuss weapon decommissioning, peace strategies, reparations for victims, and security with ETA, as Britain discussed with the Provisional IRA.\nETA has declared ceasefires many times before, most significantly in 1999 and 2006, but the Spanish government and media outlets expressed particularly hopeful opinions regarding the permanence of this proclamation. Spanish premier Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero described the move as \"a victory for democracy, law and reason\". Additionally, the effort of security and intelligence forces in Spain and France are cited by politicians as the primary instruments responsible for the weakening of ETA. The optimism may come as a surprise considering ETA's failure to renounce the independence movement, which has been one of the Spanish government's requirements.\nLess optimistically, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of the centre-right People's Party expressed the need to push for the full dissolution of ETA. The People's Party has emphasized the obligation of the state to refuse negotiations with separatist movements since former Prime Minister Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Aznar was in office. Aznar was responsible for banning media outlets seen as subversive to the state and Batasuna, the political party of ETA. Additionally, in preparation for his party's manifesto, on 30 October 2011, Rajoy declared that the People's Party would not negotiate with ETA under threats of violence nor announcements of the group's termination, but would instead focus party efforts on remembering and honouring victims of separatist violence.\nThis event may not alter the goals of the Basque separatist movement but will change the method of the fight for a more autonomous state. Negotiations with the newly elected administration may prove difficult with the return to the centre-right People's Party, which is replacing Socialist control, due to pressure from within the party to refuse all ETA negotiations.\nIn September 2016, French police stated that they did not believe ETA had made progress in giving up arms. In March 2017, well-known French-Basque activist was quoted as having told \"Le Monde\", \"ETA has made us responsible for the disarmament of its arsenal, and by the afternoon of 8 April, ETA will be completely unarmed.\" On 7 April, the BBC reported that ETA would disarm \"tomorrow\", including a photo of a stamped ETA letter attesting to this. The French police found 3.5 tonnes of weapons on 8 April, the following day, at the caches handed over by ETA.\nETA, for its part, issued a statement endorsing the 2017 Catalan independence referendum.\nEnd of political activity.\nIn a letter to online newspaper \"El Diario\", published on 2 May 2018, ETA formally announced that it had \"completely dissolved all its structures and ended its political initiative\" on 16 April 2018.\nVictims, tactics and attacks.\nVictims.\nETA's targets expanded from military or police-related personnel and their families to a wider array, which included the following:\nTactics.\nETA's tactics included:\nActivity.\nWith its attacks against what they considered \"enemies of the Basque people\", ETA killed over 820 people since 1968, including more than 340 civilians. It maimed hundreds more and kidnapped dozens.\nIts ability to inflict violence had declined steadily since the group was at its strongest during the late 1970s and 1980 (when it killed 92 people in a single year). After decreasing peaks in the fatal casualties in 1987 and 1991, 2000 was the last year when ETA killed more than 20 in a single year. After 2002, the yearly number of ETA's fatal casualties was reduced to single digits.\nSimilarly, over the 1990s and, especially, during the 2000s, fluid cooperation between the French and Spanish police, state-of-the-art tracking devices and techniques and, apparently, police infiltration allowed increasingly repeating blows to ETA's leadership and structure (between May 2008 and April 2009 no less than four consecutive \"military chiefs\" were arrested).\nETA operated mainly in Spain, particularly in the Basque Country, Navarre, and (to a lesser degree) Madrid, Barcelona, and the tourist areas of the Spanish Mediterranean coast. To date, about 65% of ETA's killings were committed in the Basque Country, followed by Madrid with roughly 15%. Navarre and Catalonia also registered significant numbers.\nActions in France usually consisted of assaults on arsenals or military industries to steal weapons or explosives; these were usually stored in large quantities in hide-outs located in the French Basque Country rather than Spain. The French judge Laurence Le Vert was threatened by ETA and a plot arguably aiming to assassinate her was unveiled. Only very rarely have ETA members engaged in shootings with the French Gendarmerie. This often occurred mainly when members of the group were confronted at checkpoints.\nDespite this, on 1 December 2007 ETA killed two Spanish Civil Guards on counter-terrorist surveillance duties in Capbreton, Landes, France. This was its first killing after it ended its 2006 declaration of \"permanent ceasefire\" and the first killing committed by ETA in France of a Spanish police agent since 1976, when they kidnapped, tortured and assassinated two Spanish inspectors in Hendaye.\nFinancing.\nIn 2007, police reports pointed out that, after the serious blows suffered by ETA and its political counterparts during the 2000s, its budget would have been adjusted to \u20ac2,000,000 annually.\nAlthough ETA used robbery as a means of financing its activities in its early days, it was accused both of arms trafficking and of benefiting economically from its political counterpart Batasuna. Extortion was ETA's main source of funds.\nBasque nationalist context.\nETA was considered to form part of what is informally known as the Basque National Liberation Movement, a movement born much after ETA's creation. This loose term refers to a range of political organizations that are ideologically similar, comprising several distinct organizations that promote a type of leftist Basque nationalism that is often referred to by the Basque-language term \"Ezker Abertzalea\" (Nationalist Left). Other groups typically considered to belong to this independentist movement are the political party Batasuna, the nationalist youth organization Segi, the labour union Langile Abertzaleen Batzordeak (LAB), and Askatasuna among others. There are often strong interconnections between these groups, double or even triple membership are not infrequent.\nThere are Basque nationalist parties with similar goals as those of ETA (namely, independence) but who openly reject their violent means. They are: EAJ-PNV, Eusko Alkartasuna, Aralar and, in the French Basque country, Abertzaleen Batasuna. Also, many left-wing parties, such as Ezker Batua, Batzarre and some sectors of the EAJ-PNV party, also support self-determination but are not in favour of independence.\nFrench role.\nHistorically, members of ETA took refuge in France, particularly the French Basque Country. The leadership typically chose to live in France for security reasons, where police pressure was much less than in Spain. Accordingly, ETA's tactical approach had been to downplay the issue of independence of the French Basque country so as to get French acquiescence for their activities. The French government quietly tolerated the group, especially during Franco's regime, when ETA members could face the death penalty in Spain. In the 1980s, the advent of the GAL still hindered counter-terrorist cooperation between France and Spain, with the French government considering ETA a Spanish domestic problem. At the time, ETA members often travelled between the two countries using the French sanctuary as a base of operations.\nWith the disbanding of the GAL, the French government changed its position on the matter and in the 1990s initiated the ongoing period of active cooperation with the Spanish government against ETA, including fast-track transfers of detainees to Spanish tribunals that are regarded as fully compliant with European Union legislation on human rights and the legal representation of detainees. Virtually all of the highest ranks within ETA \u2013including their successive \"military\", \"political\" or finances chiefs \u2013 have been captured in French territory, from where they had been plotting their activities after having crossed the border from Spain.\nIn response to the new situation, ETA carried out attacks against French policemen and made threats to some French judges and prosecutors. This implied a change from the group's previous low-profile in the French Basque Country, which successive ETA leaders had used to discreetly manage their activities in Spain.\nGovernment response.\nETA considered its prisoners political prisoners. Until 2003, ETA consequently forbade them to ask penal authorities for progression to \"tercer grado\" (a form of open prison that allows single-day or weekend furloughs) or parole. Before that date, those who did so were menaced and expelled from the group. Some were assassinated by ETA for leaving the group and going through reinsertion programs.\nThe Spanish Government passed the \"Ley de Partidos Pol\u00edticos\". This is a law barring political parties that support violence and do not condemn terrorist actions or are involved with terrorist groups.&lt;ref name=\"Ley 6/2002\"&gt;Ley Org\u00e1nica 6/2002, de 27 de Junio, de Partidos Pol\u00edticos. Noticias.juridicas.com (21 January 2011). Retrieved on 30 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The law resulted in the banning of Herri Batasuna and its successor parties unless they explicitly condemned terrorist actions and, at times, imprisoning or trying some of its leaders who have been indicted for cooperation with ETA.\nJudge Baltasar Garz\u00f3n initiated a judicial procedure (coded as \"18/98\"), aimed towards the support structure of ETA. This procedure started in 1998 with the preventive closure of the newspaper \"Egin\" (and its associated radio-station \"Egin Irratia\"), accused of being linked to ETA, and temporary imprisoning the editor of its \"investigative unit\", Pepe Rei, under similar accusations. In August 1999 Judge Baltasar Garz\u00f3n authorized the reopening of the newspaper and the radio, but they could not reopen due to economic difficulties.\nJudicial procedure 18/98 has many ramifications, including the following:\nIn 2007, indicted members of the youth movements Haika, Segi and Jarrai were found guilty of a crime of connivance with terrorism.\nIn May 2008, leading ETA figures were arrested in Bordeaux, France. Francisco Javier L\u00f3pez Pe\u00f1a, also known as 'Thierry,' had been on the run for twenty years before his arrest. A final total of arrests brought in six people, including ETA members and supporters, including the ex-Mayor of Andoain, Jos\u00e9 Antonio Barandiar\u00e1n, who is rumoured to have led police to 'Thierry'. The Spanish Interior Ministry claimed the relevance of the arrests would come in time with the investigation. Furthermore, the Interior Minister said that those members of ETA now arrested had ordered the latest attacks and that senior ETA member Francisco Javier L\u00f3pez Pe\u00f1a was \"not just another arrest because he is, in all probability, the man who has most political and military weight in the terrorist group.\"\nAfter Lopez Pena's arrest, along with the Basque referendum being put on hold, police work has been on the rise. On 22 July 2008, Spanish police dismantled the most active cell of ETA by detaining nine suspected members of the group. Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said about the arrests: \"We can't say this is the only ETA unit but it was the most active, most dynamic and of course the most wanted one.\" Four days later French police also arrested two suspects believed to be tied to the same active cell. The two suspects were: Asier Eceiza considered a top aide to a senior ETA operative still sought by police, and Olga Comes, whom authorities have linked to the ETA suspects.\nInternational response.\nThe European Union and the United States listed ETA as a terrorist group in their relevant watch lists. ETA has been a Proscribed Organisation in the United Kingdom under the Terrorism Act 2000 since 29 March 2001. The Canadian Parliament listed ETA as a terrorist group in 2003.\nFrance and Spain have often shown co-operation in the fight against ETA, after France's lack of co-operation during the Franco era. In late 2007, two Spanish guards were shot to death in France when on a joint operation with their French counterparts. Furthermore, in May 2008, the arrests of four people in Bordeaux led to a breakthrough against ETA, according to the Spanish Interior Ministry.\nIn 2008, as ETA activity increased, France increased its pressure on ETA by arresting more ETA suspects, including Unai Fano, Mar\u00eda Lizarraga, and Esteban Murillo Zubiri in Bidarrain. He had been wanted by the Spanish authorities since 2007 when a Europol arrest warrant was issued against him. French judicial authorities had already ordered that he be held in prison on remand.\nSpain has also sought cooperation from the United Kingdom in dealing with ETA-IRA ties. In 2008, this came to light after I\u00f1aki de Juana Chaos, whose release from prison was cancelled on appeal, had moved to Belfast. He was thought to be staying at an IRA safe house while being sought by the Spanish authorities. Interpol notified the judge, Eloy Velasco, that he was in either the Republic of Ireland or Northern Ireland."}
{"id": "9927", "revid": "20483999", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9927", "title": "Endomembrane system", "text": "The endomembrane system is composed of the different membranes that are suspended in the cytoplasm within a eukaryotic cell. These membranes divide the cell into functional and structural compartments, or organelles. In eukaryotes the organelles of the endomembrane system include: the nuclear membrane, the endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, vesicles, endosomes, and plasma (cell) membrane among others. The system is defined more accurately as the set of membranes that form a single functional and developmental unit, either being connected directly, or exchanging material through vesicle transport. Importantly, the endomembrane system does not include the membranes of chloroplasts or mitochondria, but might have evolved from the latter (see below: Evolution).\nThe nuclear membrane contains a lipid bilayer that encompass the contents of the nucleus. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a synthesis and transport organelle that branches into the cytoplasm in plant and animal cells. The Golgi apparatus is a series of multiple compartments where molecules are packaged for delivery to other cell components or for secretion from the cell. Vacuoles, which are found in both plant and animal cells (though much bigger in plant cells), are responsible for maintaining the shape and structure of the cell as well as storing waste products. A vesicle is a relatively small, membrane-enclosed sac that stores or transports substances. The cell membrane is a protective barrier that regulates what enters and leaves the cell. There is also an organelle known as the Spitzenk\u00f6rper that is only found in fungi, and is connected with hyphal tip growth.\nIn prokaryotes endomembranes are rare, although in many photosynthetic bacteria the plasma membrane is highly folded and most of the cell cytoplasm is filled with layers of light-gathering membrane. These light-gathering membranes may even form enclosed structures called chlorosomes in green sulfur bacteria.\nThe organelles of the endomembrane system are related through direct contact or by the transfer of membrane segments as vesicles. Despite these relationships, the various membranes are not identical in structure and function. The thickness, molecular composition, and metabolic behavior of a membrane are not fixed, they may be modified several times during the membrane's life. One unifying characteristic the membranes share is a lipid bilayer, with proteins attached to either side or traversing them.\nHistory of the concept.\nMost lipids are synthesized in yeast either in the endoplasmic reticulum, lipid particles, or the mitochondrion, with little or no lipid synthesis occurring in the plasma membrane or nuclear membrane. Sphingolipid biosynthesis begins in the endoplasmic reticulum, but is completed in the Golgi apparatus. The situation is similar in mammals, with the exception of the first few steps in ether lipid biosynthesis, which occur in peroxisomes. The various membranes that enclose the other subcellular organelles must therefore be constructed by transfer of lipids from these sites of synthesis. However, although it is clear that lipid transport is a central process in organelle biogenesis, the mechanisms by which lipids are transported through cells remain poorly understood.\nThe first proposal that the membranes within cells form a single system that exchanges material between its components was by Morr\u00e9 and Mollenhauer in 1974. This proposal was made as a way of explaining how the various lipid membranes are assembled in the cell, with these membranes being assembled through \"lipid flow\" from the sites of lipid synthesis. The idea of lipid flow through a continuous system of membranes and vesicles was an alternative to the various membranes being independent entities that are formed from transport of free lipid components, such as fatty acids and sterols, through the cytosol. Importantly, the transport of lipids through the cytosol and lipid flow through a continuous endomembrane system are not mutually exclusive processes and both may occur in cells.\nComponents of the system.\nNuclear envelope.\nThe nuclear envelope surrounds the nucleus, separating its contents from the cytoplasm. It has two membranes, each a lipid bilayer with associated proteins. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane, and like that structure, features ribosomes attached to the surface. The outer membrane is also continuous with the inner nuclear membrane since the two layers are fused together at numerous tiny holes called nuclear pores that perforate the nuclear envelope. These pores are about 120 nm in diameter and regulate the passage of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, permitting some to pass through the membrane, but not others. Since the nuclear pores are located in an area of high traffic, they play an important role in the physiology of cells. The space between the outer and inner membranes is called the perinuclear space and is joined with the lumen of the rough ER.\nThe nuclear envelope's structure is determined by a network of intermediate filaments (protein filaments). This network is organized into lining similar to mesh called the nuclear lamina, which binds to chromatin, integral membrane proteins, and other nuclear components along the inner surface of the nucleus. The nuclear lamina is thought to help materials inside the nucleus reach the nuclear pores and in the disintegration of the nuclear envelope during mitosis and its reassembly at the end of the process.\nThe nuclear pores are highly efficient at selectively allowing the passage of materials to and from the nucleus, because the nuclear envelope has a considerable amount of traffic. RNA and ribosomal subunits must be continually transferred from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Histones, gene regulatory proteins, DNA and RNA polymerases, and other substances essential for nuclear activities must be imported from the cytoplasm. The nuclear envelope of a typical mammalian cell contains 3000\u20134000 pore complexes. If the cell is synthesizing DNA each pore complex needs to transport about 100 histone molecules per minute. If the cell is growing rapidly, each complex also needs to transport about 6 newly assembled large and small ribosomal subunits per minute from the nucleus to the cytosol, where they are used to synthesize proteins.\nEndoplasmic reticulum.\nThe endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a membranous synthesis and transport organelle that is an extension of the nuclear envelope. More than half the total membrane in eukaryotic cells is accounted for by the ER. The ER is made up of flattened sacs and branching tubules that are thought to interconnect, so that the ER membrane forms a continuous sheet enclosing a single internal space. This highly convoluted space is called the ER lumen and is also referred to as the ER cisternal space. The lumen takes up about ten percent of the entire cell volume. The endoplasmic reticulum membrane allows molecules to be selectively transferred between the lumen and the cytoplasm, and since it is connected to the nuclear envelope, it provides a channel between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.\nThe ER has a central role in producing, processing, and transporting biochemical compounds for use inside and outside of the cell. Its membrane is the site of production of all the transmembrane proteins and lipids for most of the cell's organelles, including the ER itself, the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, endosomes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, secretory vesicles, and the plasma membrane. Furthermore, almost all of the proteins that will exit the cell, plus those destined for the lumen of the ER, Golgi apparatus, or lysosomes, are originally delivered to the ER lumen. Consequently, many of the proteins found in the cisternal space of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen are there only temporarily as they pass on their way to other locations. Other proteins, however, constantly remain in the lumen and are known as endoplasmic reticulum resident proteins. These special proteins contain a specialized retention signal made up of a specific sequence of amino acids that enables them to be retained by the organelle. An example of an important endoplasmic reticulum resident protein is the chaperone protein known as BiP which identifies other proteins that have been improperly built or processed and keeps them from being sent to their final destinations.\nThe ER is involved in cotranslational sorting of proteins. A polypeptide which contains an ER signal sequence is recognised by a signal recognition protein which halts the production of the protein. The SRP transports the polypeptide to the ER membrane where its released in through a membrane pore and translation resumes.\nThere are two distinct, though connected, regions of ER that differ in structure and function: smooth ER and rough ER. The rough endoplasmic reticulum is so named because the cytoplasmic surface is covered with ribosomes, giving it a bumpy appearance when viewed through an electron microscope. The smooth ER appears smooth since its cytoplasmic surface lacks ribosomes.\nFunctions of the smooth ER.\nIn the great majority of cells, smooth ER regions are scarce and are often partly smooth and partly rough. They are sometimes called transitional ER because they contain ER exit sites from which transport vesicles carrying newly synthesized proteins and lipids bud off for transport to the Golgi apparatus. In certain specialized cells, however, the smooth ER is abundant and has additional functions. The smooth ER of these specialized cells functions in diverse metabolic processes, including synthesis of lipids, metabolism of carbohydrates, and detoxification of drugs and poisons.\nEnzymes of the smooth ER are vital to the synthesis of lipids, including oils, phospholipids, and steroids. Sex hormones of vertebrates and the steroid hormones secreted by the adrenal glands are among the steroids produced by the smooth ER in animal cells. The cells that synthesize these hormones are rich in smooth ER.\nLiver cells are another example of specialized cells that contain an abundance of smooth ER. These cells provide an example of the role of smooth ER in carbohydrate metabolism. Liver cells store carbohydrates in the form of glycogen. The breakdown of glycogen eventually leads to the release of glucose from the liver cells, which is important in the regulation of sugar concentration in the blood. However, the primary product of glycogen breakdown is glucose-1-phosphate. This is converted to glucose-6-phosphate and then an enzyme of the liver cell's smooth ER removes the phosphate from the glucose, so that it can then leave the cell.\nEnzymes of the smooth ER can also help detoxify drugs and poisons. Detoxification usually involves the addition of a hydroxyl group to a drug, making the drug more soluble and thus easier to purge from the body. One extensively studied detoxification reaction is carried out by the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, which catalyze water-insoluble drugs or metabolites that would otherwise accumulate to toxic levels in cell membrane.\nMuscle cells have another specialized function of smooth ER. The ER membrane pumps calcium ions from the cytosol into the cisternal space. When a muscle cell becomes stimulated by a nerve impulse, calcium goes back across the ER membrane into the cytosol and generates the contraction of the muscle cell.\nFunctions of the rough ER.\nMany types of cells export proteins produced by ribosomes attached to the rough ER. The ribosomes assemble amino acids into protein units, which are carried into the rough ER for further adjustments. These proteins may be either transmembrane proteins, which become embedded in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, or water-soluble proteins, which are able to pass through the membrane into the lumen. Those that reach the inside of the endoplasmic reticulum are folded into the correct three-dimensional conformation. Chemicals, such as carbohydrates or sugars, are added, then the endoplasmic reticulum either transports the completed proteins, called secretory proteins, to areas of the cell where they are needed, or they are sent to the Golgi apparatus for further processing and modification.\nOnce secretory proteins are formed, the ER membrane separates them from the proteins that will remain in the cytosol. Secretory proteins depart from the ER enfolded in the membranes of vesicles that bud like bubbles from the transitional ER. These vesicles in transit to another part of the cell are called transport vesicles. An alternative mechanism for transport of lipids and proteins out of the ER are through lipid transfer proteins at regions called membrane contact sites where the ER becomes closely and stably associated with the membranes of other organelles, such as the plasma membrane, Golgi or lysosomes.\nIn addition to making secretory proteins, the rough ER makes membranes that grows in place from the addition of proteins and phospholipids. As polypeptides intended to be membrane proteins grow from the ribosomes, they are inserted into the ER membrane itself and are kept there by their hydrophobic portions. The rough ER also produces its own membrane phospholipids; enzymes built into the ER membrane assemble phospholipids. The ER membrane expands and can be transferred by transport vesicles to other components of the endomembrane system.\nGolgi apparatus.\nThe Golgi apparatus (also known as the Golgi body and the Golgi complex) is composed of separate sacs called cisternae. Its shape is similar to a stack of pancakes. The number of these stacks varies with the specific function of the cell. The Golgi apparatus is used by the cell for further protein modification. The section of the Golgi apparatus that receives the vesicles from the ER is known as the cis face, and is usually near the ER. The opposite end of the Golgi apparatus is called the trans face, this is where the modified compounds leave. The trans face is usually facing the plasma membrane, which is where most of the substances the Golgi apparatus modifies are sent.\nVesicles sent off by the ER containing proteins are further altered at the Golgi apparatus and then prepared for secretion from the cell or transport to other parts of the cell. Various things can happen to the proteins on their journey through the enzyme covered space of the Golgi apparatus. The modification and synthesis of the carbohydrate portions of glycoproteins is common in protein processing. The Golgi apparatus removes and substitutes sugar monomers, producing a large variety of oligosaccharides. In addition to modifying proteins, the Golgi also manufactures macromolecules itself. In plant cells, the Golgi produces pectins and other polysaccharides needed by the plant structure.\nOnce the modification process is completed, the Golgi apparatus sorts the products of its processing and sends them to various parts of the cell. Molecular identification labels or tags are added by the Golgi enzymes to help with this. After everything is organized, the Golgi apparatus sends off its products by budding vesicles from its trans face.\nVacuoles.\nVacuoles, like vesicles, are membrane-bound sacs within the cell. They are larger than vesicles and their specific function varies. The operations of vacuoles are different for plant and animal vacuoles.\nIn plant cells, vacuoles cover anywhere from 30% to 90% of the total cell volume. Most mature plant cells contain one large central vacuole encompassed by a membrane called the tonoplast. Vacuoles of plant cells act as storage compartments for the nutrients and waste of a cell. The solution that these molecules are stored in is called the cell sap. Pigments that color the cell are sometime located in the cell sap. Vacuoles can also increase the size of the cell, which elongates as water is added, and they control the turgor pressure (the osmotic pressure that keeps the cell wall from caving in). Like lysosomes of animal cells, vacuoles have an acidic pH and contain hydrolytic enzymes. The pH of vacuoles enables them to perform homeostatic procedures in the cell. For example, when the pH in the cells environment drops, the H+ ions surging into the cytosol can be transferred to a vacuole in order to keep the cytosol's pH constant.\nIn animals, vacuoles serve in exocytosis and endocytosis processes. Endocytosis refers to when substances are taken into the cell, whereas for exocytosis substances are moved from the cell into the extracellular space. Material to be taken-in is surrounded by the plasma membrane, and then transferred to a vacuole. There are two types of endocytosis, phagocytosis (cell eating) and pinocytosis (cell drinking). In phagocytosis, cells engulf large particles such as bacteria. Pinocytosis is the same process, except the substances being ingested are in the fluid form.\nVesicles.\nVesicles are small membrane-enclosed transport units that can transfer molecules between different compartments. Most vesicles transfer the membranes assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, and then from the Golgi apparatus to various locations.\nThere are various types of vesicles each with a different protein configuration. Most are formed from specific regions of membranes. When a vesicle buds off from a membrane it contains specific proteins on its cytosolic surface. Each membrane a vesicle travels to contains a marker on its cytosolic surface. This marker corresponds with the proteins on the vesicle traveling to the membrane. Once the vesicle finds the membrane, they fuse.\nThere are three well known types of vesicles. They are clathrin-coated, COPI-coated, and COPII-coated vesicles. Each performs different functions in the cell. For example, clathrin-coated vesicles transport substances between the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane. COPI- and COPII-coated vesicles are frequently used for transportation between the ER and the Golgi apparatus.\nLysosomes.\nLysosomes are organelles that contain hydrolytic enzymes that are used for intracellular digestion. The main functions of a lysosome are to process molecules taken in by the cell and to recycle worn out cell parts. The enzymes inside of lysosomes are acid hydrolases which require an acidic environment for optimal performance. Lysosomes provide such an environment by maintaining a pH of 5.0 inside of the organelle. If a lysosome were to rupture, the enzymes released would not be very active because of the cytosol's neutral pH. However, if numerous lysosomes leaked the cell could be destroyed from autodigestion.\nLysosomes carry out intracellular digestion, in a process called phagocytosis (from the Greek , to eat and , vessel, referring here to the cell), by fusing with a vacuole and releasing their enzymes into the vacuole. Through this process, sugars, amino acids, and other monomers pass into the cytosol and become nutrients for the cell. Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to recycle the cell's obsolete organelles in a process called autophagy. The lysosome engulfs another organelle and uses its enzymes to take apart the ingested material. The resulting organic monomers are then returned to the cytosol for reuse. The last function of a lysosome is to digest the cell itself through autolysis.\nSpitzenk\u00f6rper.\nThe spitzenk\u00f6rper is a component of the endomembrane system found only in fungi, and is associated with hyphal tip growth. It is a phase-dark body that is composed of an aggregation of membrane-bound vesicles containing cell wall components, serving as a point of assemblage and release of such components intermediate between the Golgi and the cell membrane. The spitzenk\u00f6rper is motile and generates new hyphal tip growth as it moves forward.\nPlasma membrane.\nThe plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer membrane that separates the cell from its environment and regulates the transport of molecules and signals into and out of the cell. Embedded in the membrane are proteins that perform the functions of the plasma membrane. The plasma membrane is not a fixed or rigid structure, the molecules that compose the membrane are capable of lateral movement. This movement and the multiple components of the membrane are why it is referred to as a fluid mosaic. Smaller molecules such as carbon dioxide, water, and oxygen can pass through the plasma membrane freely by diffusion or osmosis. Larger molecules needed by the cell are assisted by proteins through active transport.\nThe plasma membrane of a cell has multiple functions. These include transporting nutrients into the cell, allowing waste to leave, preventing materials from entering the cell, averting needed materials from leaving the cell, maintaining the pH of the cytosol, and preserving the osmotic pressure of the cytosol. Transport proteins which allow some materials to pass through but not others are used for these functions. These proteins use ATP hydrolysis to pump materials against their concentration gradients.\nIn addition to these universal functions, the plasma membrane has a more specific role in multicellular organisms. Glycoproteins on the membrane assist the cell in recognizing other cells, in order to exchange metabolites and form tissues. Other proteins on the plasma membrane allow attachment to the cytoskeleton and extracellular matrix; a function that maintains cell shape and fixes the location of membrane proteins. Enzymes that catalyze reactions are also found on the plasma membrane. Receptor proteins on the membrane have a shape that matches with a chemical messenger, resulting in various cellular responses.\nEvolution.\nThe origin of the endomembrane system is linked to the origin of eukaryotes themselves and the origin of eukaryoties to the endosymbiotic origin of mitochondria. Many models have been put forward to explain the origin of the endomembrane system (reviewed in). The most recent concept suggests that the endomembrane system evolved from outer membrane vesicles the endosymbiotic mitochondrion secreted.

In some parts of the world, ethnology has developed along independent paths of investigation and pedagogical doctrine, with \"cultural anthropology\" becoming dominant especially in the United States, and \"social anthropology\" in Great Britain. The distinction between the three terms is increasingly blurry. Ethnology has been considered an academic field since the late 18th century, especially in Europe and is sometimes conceived of as any comparative study of human groups.\nThe 15th-century exploration of America by European explorers had an important role in formulating new notions of the Occident (the Western world), such as the notion of the \"Other\". This term was used in conjunction with \"savages\", which was either seen as a brutal barbarian, or alternatively, as the \"noble savage\". Thus, civilization was opposed in a dualist manner to barbary, a classic opposition constitutive of the even more commonly shared ethnocentrism. The progress of ethnology, for example with Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss's structural anthropology, led to the criticism of conceptions of a linear progress, or the pseudo-opposition between \"societies with histories\" and \"societies without histories\", judged too dependent on a limited view of history as constituted by accumulative growth.\nL\u00e9vi-Strauss often referred to Montaigne's essay on cannibalism as an early example of ethnology. L\u00e9vi-Strauss aimed, through a structural method, at discovering universal invariants in human society, chief among which he believed to be the incest taboo. However, the claims of such cultural universalism have been criticized by various 19th- and 20th-century social thinkers, including Marx, Nietzsche, Foucault, Derrida, Althusser, and Deleuze.\nThe French school of ethnology was particularly significant for the development of the discipline, since the early 1950s. Important figures in this movement have included L\u00e9vi-Strauss, Paul Rivet, Marcel Griaule, Germaine Dieterlen, and Jean Rouch.\nScholars.\nSee: List of scholars of ethnology"}

As a mother sauce, it serves as the starting point for many derivatives, such as sauce africaine, sauce bigarade, sauce bourguignonne, sauce aux champignons, sauce charcuti\u00e8re, sauce chasseur, sauce chevreuil, and demi-glace. Hundreds of other derivatives are in the classical French repertoire.\nEscoffier included a recipe for a Lenten espagnole sauce, using fish stock and mushrooms, in \"Le Guide culinaire\", but doubted its necessity.\nPreparation.\nThe basic method of making espagnole is to prepare a very dark brown roux, to which brown stock (stock made from simmering roasted bones, meats and aromatics) is added, along with roasted bones, pieces of beef, vegetables, brown sugar and various seasonings. This blend is allowed to slowly reduce while being frequently skimmed. The classic recipe calls for additional veal stock to be added as the liquid gradually reduces, but today, water is generally used instead.

{"id": "9931", "revid": "5229428", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9931", "title": "Amplifier", "text": " \nAn amplifier, electronic amplifier or (informally) amp is an electronic device that can increase the power of a signal (a time-varying voltage or current). It is a two-port electronic circuit that uses electric power from a power supply to increase the amplitude of a signal applied to its input terminals, producing a proportionally greater amplitude signal at its output. The amount of amplification provided by an amplifier is measured by its gain: the ratio of output voltage, current, or power to input. An amplifier is a circuit that has a power gain greater than one.\nAn amplifier can either be a separate piece of equipment or an electrical circuit contained within another device. Amplification is fundamental to modern electronics, and amplifiers are widely used in almost all electronic equipment. Amplifiers can be categorized in different ways. One is by the frequency of the electronic signal being amplified. For example, audio amplifiers amplify signals in the audio (sound) range of less than 20\u00a0kHz, RF amplifiers amplify frequencies in the radio frequency range between 20\u00a0kHz and 300\u00a0GHz, and servo amplifiers and instrumentation amplifiers may work with very low frequencies down to direct current. Amplifiers can also be categorized by their physical placement in the signal chain; a preamplifier may precede other signal processing stages, for example. The first practical electrical device which could amplify was the triode vacuum tube, invented in 1906 by Lee De Forest, which led to the first amplifiers around 1912. Today most amplifiers use transistors.\nHistory.\nVacuum tubes.\nThe first practical prominent device that could amplify was the triode vacuum tube, invented in 1906 by Lee De Forest, which led to the first amplifiers around 1912. Vacuum tubes were used in almost all amplifiers until the 1960s\u20131970s when transistors replaced them. Today, most amplifiers use transistors, but vacuum tubes continue to be used in some applications.\nThe development of audio communication technology in form of the telephone, first patented in 1876, created the need to increase the amplitude of electrical signals to extend the transmission of signals over increasingly long distances. In telegraphy, this problem had been solved with intermediate devices at stations that replenished the dissipated energy by operating a signal recorder and transmitter back-to-back, forming a relay, so that a local energy source at each intermediate station powered the next leg of transmission.\nFor duplex transmission, i.e. sending and receiving in both directions, bi-directional relay repeaters were developed starting with the work of C. F. Varley for telegraphic transmission. Duplex transmission was essential for telephony and the problem was not satisfactorily solved until 1904, when H. E. Shreeve of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company improved existing attempts at constructing a telephone repeater consisting of back-to-back carbon-granule transmitter and electrodynamic receiver pairs. The Shreeve repeater was first tested on a line between Boston and Amesbury, MA, and more refined devices remained in service for some time. After the turn of the century it was found that negative resistance mercury lamps could amplify, and were also tried in repeaters, with little success.\nThe development of thermionic valves starting around 1902, provided an entirely electronic method of amplifying signals. The first practical version of such devices was the Audion triode, invented in 1906 by Lee De Forest, which led to the first amplifiers around 1912. Since the only previous device which was widely used to strengthen a signal was the relay used in telegraph systems, the amplifying vacuum tube was first called an \"electron relay\". The terms \"amplifier\" and \"amplification\", derived from the Latin \"amplificare\", (\"to enlarge or expand\"), were first used for this new capability around 1915 when triodes became widespread.\nThe amplifying vacuum tube revolutionized electrical technology, creating the new field of electronics, the technology of active electrical devices. It made possible long-distance telephone lines, public address systems, radio broadcasting, talking motion pictures, practical audio recording, radar, television, and the first computers. For 50 years virtually all consumer electronic devices used vacuum tubes. Early tube amplifiers often had positive feedback (regeneration), which could increase gain but also make the amplifier unstable and prone to oscillation. Much of the mathematical theory of amplifiers was developed at Bell Telephone Laboratories during the 1920s to 1940s. Distortion levels in early amplifiers were high, usually around 5%, until 1934, when Harold Black developed negative feedback; this allowed the distortion levels to be greatly reduced, at the cost of lower gain. Other advances in the theory of amplification were made by Harry Nyquist and Hendrik Wade Bode.\nThe vacuum tube was virtually the only amplifying device, other than specialized power devices such as the magnetic amplifier and amplidyne, for 40 years. Power control circuitry used magnetic amplifiers until the latter half of the twentieth century when power semiconductor devices became more economical, with higher operating speeds. The old Shreeve electroacoustic carbon repeaters were used in adjustable amplifiers in telephone subscriber sets for the hearing impaired until the transistor provided smaller and higher quality amplifiers in the 1950s.\nTransistors.\nThe first working transistor was a point-contact transistor invented by John Bardeen and Walter Brattain in 1947 at Bell Labs, where William Shockley later invented the bipolar junction transistor (BJT) in 1948. They were followed by the invention of the metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET) by Mohamed M. Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959. Due to MOSFET scaling, the ability to scale down to increasingly small sizes, the MOSFET has since become the most widely used amplifier.\nThe replacement of bulky electron tubes with transistors during the 1960s and 1970s created a revolution in electronics, making possible a large class of portable electronic devices, such as the transistor radio developed in 1954. Today, use of vacuum tubes is limited for some high power applications, such as radio transmitters.\nBeginning in the 1970s, more and more transistors were connected on a single chip thereby creating higher scales of integration (such as small-scale, medium-scale and large-scale integration) in integrated circuits. Many amplifiers commercially available today are based on integrated circuits.\nFor special purposes, other active elements have been used. For example, in the early days of the satellite communication, parametric amplifiers were used. The core circuit was a diode whose capacitance was changed by an RF signal created locally. Under certain conditions, this RF signal provided energy that was modulated by the extremely weak satellite signal received at the earth station.\nAdvances in digital electronics since the late 20th century provided new alternatives to the traditional linear-gain amplifiers by using digital switching to vary the pulse-shape of fixed amplitude signals, resulting in devices such as the Class-D amplifier.\nIdeal.\nIn principle, an amplifier is an electrical two-port network that produces a signal at the output port that is a replica of the signal applied to the input port, but increased in magnitude.\nThe input port can be idealized as either being a voltage input, which takes no current, with the output proportional to the voltage across the port; or a current input, with no voltage across it, in which the output is proportional to the current through the port. The output port can be idealized as being either a dependent voltage source, with zero source resistance and its output voltage dependent on the input; or a dependent current source, with infinite source resistance and the output current dependent on the input. Combinations of these choices lead to four types of ideal amplifiers. In idealized form they are represented by each of the four types of dependent source used in linear analysis, as shown in the figure, namely:\nEach type of amplifier in its ideal form has an ideal input and output resistance that is the same as that of the corresponding dependent source:\nIn real amplifiers the ideal impedances are not possible to achieve, but these ideal elements can be used to construct equivalent circuits of real amplifiers by adding impedances (resistance, capacitance and inductance) to the input and output. For any particular circuit, a small-signal analysis is often used to find the actual impedance. A small-signal AC test current \"Ix\" is applied to the input or output node, all external sources are set to AC zero, and the corresponding alternating voltage \"Vx\" across the test current source determines the impedance seen at that node as \"R = Vx / Ix\".\nAmplifiers designed to attach to a transmission line at input and output, especially RF amplifiers, do not fit into this classification approach. Rather than dealing with voltage or current individually, they ideally couple with an input or output impedance matched to the transmission line impedance, that is, match \"ratios\" of voltage to current. Many real RF amplifiers come close to this ideal. Although, for a given appropriate source and load impedance, RF amplifiers can be characterized as amplifying voltage or current, they fundamentally are amplifying power.\nProperties.\nAmplifier properties are given by parameters that include: \nAmplifiers are described according to the properties of their inputs, their outputs, and how they relate. All amplifiers have gain, a multiplication factor that relates the magnitude of some property of the output signal to a property of the input signal. The gain may be specified as the ratio of output voltage to input voltage (voltage gain), output power to input power (power gain), or some combination of current, voltage, and power. In many cases the property of the output that varies is dependent on the same property of the input, making the gain unitless (though often expressed in decibels (dB)).\nMost amplifiers are designed to be linear. That is, they provide constant gain for any normal input level and output signal. If an amplifier's gain is not linear, the output signal can become distorted. There are, however, cases where variable gain is useful. Certain signal processing applications use exponential gain amplifiers.\nAmplifiers are usually designed to function well in a specific application, for example: radio and television transmitters and receivers, high-fidelity (\"hi-fi\") stereo equipment, microcomputers and other digital equipment, and guitar and other instrument amplifiers. Every amplifier includes at least one active device, such as a vacuum tube or transistor.\nNegative feedback.\nNegative feedback is a technique used in most modern amplifiers to improve bandwidth and distortion and control gain. In a negative feedback amplifier part of the output is fed back and added to the input in opposite phase, subtracting from the input. The main effect is to reduce the overall gain of the system. However, any unwanted signals introduced by the amplifier, such as distortion are also fed back. Since they are not part of the original input, they are added to the input in opposite phase, subtracting them from the input. In this way, negative feedback also reduces nonlinearity, distortion and other errors introduced by the amplifier. Large amounts of negative feedback can reduce errors to the point that the response of the amplifier itself becomes almost irrelevant as long as it has a large gain, and the output performance of the system (the \"closed loop performance\") is defined entirely by the components in the feedback loop. This technique is particularly used with operational amplifiers (op-amps).\nNon-feedback amplifiers can only achieve about 1% distortion for audio-frequency signals. With negative feedback, distortion can typically be reduced to 0.001%. Noise, even crossover distortion, can be practically eliminated. Negative feedback also compensates for changing temperatures, and degrading or nonlinear components in the gain stage, but any change or nonlinearity in the components in the feedback loop will affect the output. Indeed, the ability of the feedback loop to define the output is used to make active filter circuits.\nAnother advantage of negative feedback is that it extends the bandwidth of the amplifier. The concept of feedback is used in operational amplifiers to precisely define gain, bandwidth, and other parameters entirely based on the components in the feedback loop.\nNegative feedback can be applied at each stage of an amplifier to stabilize the operating point of active devices against minor changes in power-supply voltage or device characteristics.\nSome feedback, positive or negative, is unavoidable and often undesirable\u2014introduced, for example, by parasitic elements, such as inherent capacitance between input and output of devices such as transistors, and capacitive coupling of external wiring. Excessive frequency-dependent positive feedback can produce parasitic oscillation and turn an amplifier into an oscillator.\nCategories.\nActive devices.\nAll amplifiers include some form of active device: this is the device that does the actual amplification. The active device can be a vacuum tube, discrete solid state component, such as a single transistor, or part of an integrated circuit, as in an op-amp).\nTransistor amplifiers (or solid state amplifiers) are the most common type of amplifier in use today. A transistor is used as the active element. The gain of the amplifier is determined by the properties of the transistor itself as well as the circuit it is contained within.\nCommon active devices in transistor amplifiers include bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) and metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs).\nApplications are numerous, some common examples are audio amplifiers in a home stereo or public address system, RF high power generation for semiconductor equipment, to RF and microwave applications such as radio transmitters.\nTransistor-based amplification can be realized using various configurations: for example a bipolar junction transistor can realize common base, common collector or common emitter amplification; a MOSFET can realize common gate, common source or common drain amplification. Each configuration has different characteristics.\nVacuum-tube amplifiers (also known as tube amplifiers or valve amplifiers) use a vacuum tube as the active device. While semiconductor amplifiers have largely displaced valve amplifiers for low-power applications, valve amplifiers can be much more cost effective in high power applications such as radar, countermeasures equipment, and communications equipment. Many microwave amplifiers are specially designed valve amplifiers, such as the klystron, gyrotron, traveling wave tube, and crossed-field amplifier, and these microwave valves provide much greater single-device power output at microwave frequencies than solid-state devices. Vacuum tubes remain in use in some high end audio equipment, as well as in musical instrument amplifiers, due to a preference for \"tube sound\".\nMagnetic amplifiers are devices somewhat similar to a transformer where one winding is used to control the saturation of a magnetic core and hence alter the impedance of the other winding.\nThey have largely fallen out of use due to development in semiconductor amplifiers but are still useful in HVDC control, and in nuclear power control circuitry due to not being affected by radioactivity.\nNegative resistances can be used as amplifiers, such as the tunnel diode amplifier.\nPower amplifiers.\nA power amplifier is an amplifier designed primarily to increase the power available to a load. In practice, amplifier power gain depends on the source and load impedances, as well as the inherent voltage and current gain. A radio frequency (RF) amplifier design typically optimizes impedances for power transfer, while audio and instrumentation amplifier designs normally optimize input and output impedance for least loading and highest signal integrity. An amplifier that is said to have a gain of 20\u00a0dB might have a voltage gain of 20\u00a0dB and an available power gain of much more than 20\u00a0dB (power ratio of 100)\u2014yet actually deliver a much lower power gain if, for example, the input is from a 600\u00a0\u03a9 microphone and the output connects to a 47\u00a0k\u03a9 input socket for a power amplifier. In general, the power amplifier is the last 'amplifier' or actual circuit in a signal chain (the output stage) and is the amplifier stage that requires attention to power efficiency. Efficiency considerations lead to the various classes of power amplifiers based on the biasing of the output transistors or tubes: see power amplifier classes below.\nAudio power amplifiers are typically used to drive loudspeakers. They will often have two output channels and deliver equal power to each. An RF power amplifier is found in radio transmitter final stages. A Servo motor controller: amplifies a control voltage to adjust the speed of a motor, or the position of a motorized system.\nOperational amplifiers (op-amps).\nAn operational amplifier is an amplifier circuit which typically has very high open loop gain and differential inputs. Op amps have become very widely used as standardized \"gain blocks\" in circuits due to their versatility; their gain, bandwidth and other characteristics can be controlled by feedback through an external circuit. Though the term today commonly applies to integrated circuits, the original operational amplifier design used valves, and later designs used discrete transistor circuits.\nA fully differential amplifier is similar to the operational amplifier, but also has differential outputs. These are usually constructed using BJTs or FETs.\nDistributed amplifiers.\nThese use balanced transmission lines to separate individual single stage amplifiers, the outputs of which are summed by the same transmission line. The transmission line is a balanced type with the input at one end and on one side only of the balanced transmission line and the output at the opposite end is also the opposite side of the balanced transmission line. The gain of each stage adds linearly to the output rather than multiplies one on the other as in a cascade configuration. This allows a higher bandwidth to be achieved than could otherwise be realised even with the same gain stage elements.\nSwitched mode amplifiers.\nThese nonlinear amplifiers have much higher efficiencies than linear amps, and are used where the power saving justifies the extra complexity. Class-D amplifiers are the main example of this type of amplification.\nNegative resistance amplifier.\nNegative Resistance Amplifier is a type of Regenerative Amplifier that can use the feedback between the transistor's source and gate to transform a capacitive impedance on the transistor's source to a negative resistance on its gate. Compared to other types of amplifiers, this \"negative resistance amplifier\" will only require a tiny amount of power to achieve very high gain, maintaining a good noise figure at the same time.\nApplications.\nVideo amplifiers.\nVideo amplifiers are designed to process video signals and have varying bandwidths depending on whether the video signal is for SDTV, EDTV, HDTV 720p or 1080i/p etc.. The specification of the bandwidth itself depends on what kind of filter is used\u2014and at which point ( or for example) the bandwidth is measured. Certain requirements for step response and overshoot are necessary for an acceptable TV image.\nMicrowave amplifiers.\nTraveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTAs) are used for high power amplification at low microwave frequencies. They typically can amplify across a broad spectrum of frequencies; however, they are usually not as tunable as klystrons.\nKlystrons are specialized linear-beam vacuum-devices, designed to provide high power, widely tunable amplification of millimetre and sub-millimetre waves. Klystrons are designed for large scale operations and despite having a narrower bandwidth than TWTAs, they have the advantage of coherently amplifying a reference signal so its output may be precisely controlled in amplitude, frequency and phase.\nSolid-state devices such as silicon short channel MOSFETs like double-diffused metal-oxide-semiconductor (DMOS) FETs, GaAs FETs, SiGe and GaAs heterojunction bipolar transistors/HBTs, HEMTs, IMPATT diodes, and others, are used especially at lower microwave frequencies and power levels on the order of watts specifically in applications like portable RF terminals/cell phones and access points where size and efficiency are the drivers. New materials like gallium nitride (GaN) or GaN on silicon or on silicon carbide/SiC are emerging in HEMT transistors and applications where improved efficiency, wide bandwidth, operation roughly from few to few tens of GHz with output power of few Watts to few hundred of Watts are needed.\nDepending on the amplifier specifications and size requirements microwave amplifiers can be realised as monolithically integrated, integrated as modules or based on discrete parts or any combination of those.\nThe maser is a non-electronic microwave amplifier.\nMusical instrument amplifiers.\nInstrument amplifiers are a range of audio power amplifiers used to increase the sound level of musical instruments, for example guitars, during performances.\nClassification of amplifier stages and systems.\nCommon terminal.\nOne set of classifications for amplifiers is based on which device terminal is common to both the input and the output circuit. In the case of bipolar junction transistors, the three classes are common emitter, common base, and common collector. For field-effect transistors, the corresponding configurations are common source, common gate, and common drain; for vacuum tubes, common cathode, common grid, and common plate.\nThe common emitter (or common source, common cathode, etc.) is most often configured to provide amplification of a voltage applied between base and emitter, and the output signal taken between collector and emitter is inverted, relative to the input. The common collector arrangement applies the input voltage between base and collector, and to take the output voltage between emitter and collector. This causes negative feedback, and the output voltage tends to follow the input voltage. This arrangement is also used as the input presents a high impedance and does not load the signal source, though the voltage amplification is less than one. The common-collector circuit is, therefore, better known as an emitter follower, source follower, or cathode follower.\nUnilateral or bilateral.\nAn amplifier whose output exhibits no feedback to its input side is described as 'unilateral'. The input impedance of a unilateral amplifier is independent of load, and output impedance is independent of signal source impedance.\nAn amplifier that uses feedback to connect part of the output back to the input is a \"bilateral\" amplifier. Bilateral amplifier input impedance depends on the load, and output impedance on the signal source impedance.\nAll amplifiers are bilateral to some degree; however they may often be modeled as unilateral under operating conditions where feedback is small enough to neglect for most purposes, simplifying analysis (see the common base article for an example).\nInverting or non-inverting.\nAnother way to classify amplifiers is by the phase relationship of the input signal to the output signal. An 'inverting' amplifier produces an output 180 degrees out of phase with the input signal (that is, a polarity inversion or mirror image of the input as seen on an oscilloscope). A 'non-inverting' amplifier maintains the phase of the input signal waveforms. An emitter follower is a type of non-inverting amplifier, indicating that the signal at the emitter of a transistor is following (that is, matching with unity gain but perhaps an offset) the input signal. Voltage follower is also non inverting type of amplifier having unity gain.\nThis description can apply to a single stage of an amplifier, or to a complete amplifier system.\nFunction.\nOther amplifiers may be classified by their function or output characteristics. These functional descriptions usually apply to complete amplifier systems or sub-systems and rarely to individual stages.\nInterstage coupling method.\nAmplifiers are sometimes classified by the coupling method of the signal at the input, output, or between stages. Different types of these include:\nFrequency range.\nDepending on the frequency range and other properties amplifiers are designed according to different principles.\nFrequency ranges down to DC are only used when this property is needed. Amplifiers for direct current signals are vulnerable to minor variations in the properties of components with time. Special methods, such as chopper stabilized amplifiers are used to prevent objectionable drift in the amplifier's properties for DC. \"DC-blocking\" capacitors can be added to remove DC and sub-sonic frequencies from audio amplifiers.\nDepending on the frequency range specified different design principles must be used. Up to the MHz range only \"discrete\" properties need be considered; e.g., a terminal has an input impedance.\nAs soon as any connection within the circuit gets longer than perhaps 1% of the wavelength of the highest specified frequency (e.g., at 100\u00a0MHz the wavelength is 3\u00a0m, so the critical connection length is approx. 3\u00a0cm) design properties radically change. For example, a specified length and width of a PCB trace can be used as a selective or impedance-matching entity.\nAbove a few hundred MHz, it gets difficult to use discrete elements, especially inductors. In most cases, PCB traces of very closely defined shapes are used instead (stripline techniques).\nThe frequency range handled by an amplifier might be specified in terms of bandwidth (normally implying a response that is 3\u00a0dB down when the frequency reaches the specified bandwidth), or by specifying a frequency response that is within a certain number of decibels between a lower and an upper frequency (e.g. \"20\u00a0Hz to 20\u00a0kHz plus or minus 1\u00a0dB\").\nPower amplifier classes.\nPower amplifier circuits (output stages) are classified as A, B, AB and C for analog designs\u2014and class D and E for switching designs. The power amplifier classes are based on the proportion of each input cycle (conduction angle) during which an amplifying device passes current. The image of the conduction angle derives from amplifying a sinusoidal signal. If the device is always on, the conducting angle is 360\u00b0. If it is on for only half of each cycle, the angle is 180\u00b0. The angle of flow is closely related to the amplifier power efficiency.\nExample amplifier circuit.\nThe practical amplifier circuit shown above could be the basis for a moderate-power audio amplifier. It features a typical (though substantially simplified) design as found in modern amplifiers, with a class-AB push\u2013pull output stage, and uses some overall negative feedback. Bipolar transistors are shown, but this design would also be realizable with FETs or valves.\nThe input signal is coupled through capacitor C1 to the base of transistor Q1. The capacitor allows the AC signal to pass, but blocks the DC bias voltage established by resistors R1 and R2 so that any preceding circuit is not affected by it. Q1 and Q2 form a differential amplifier (an amplifier that multiplies the difference between two inputs by some constant), in an arrangement known as a long-tailed pair. This arrangement is used to conveniently allow the use of negative feedback, which is fed from the output to Q2 via R7 and R8.\nThe negative feedback into the difference amplifier allows the amplifier to compare the input to the actual output. The amplified signal from Q1 is directly fed to the second stage, Q3, which is a common emitter stage that provides further amplification of the signal and the DC bias for the output stages, Q4 and Q5. R6 provides the load for Q3 (a better design would probably use some form of active load here, such as a constant-current sink). So far, all of the amplifier is operating in class A. The output pair are arranged in class-AB push\u2013pull, also called a complementary pair. They provide the majority of the current amplification (while consuming low quiescent current) and directly drive the load, connected via DC-blocking capacitor C2. The diodes D1 and D2 provide a small amount of constant voltage bias for the output pair, just biasing them into the conducting state so that crossover distortion is minimized. That is, the diodes push the output stage firmly into class-AB mode (assuming that the base-emitter drop of the output transistors is reduced by heat dissipation).\nThis design is simple, but a good basis for a practical design because it automatically stabilises its operating point, since feedback internally operates from DC up through the audio range and beyond. Further circuit elements would probably be found in a real design that would roll-off the frequency response above the needed range to prevent the possibility of unwanted oscillation. Also, the use of fixed diode bias as shown here can cause problems if the diodes are not both electrically and thermally matched to the output transistors if the output transistors turn on too much, they can easily overheat and destroy themselves, as the full current from the power supply is not limited at this stage.\nA common solution to help stabilise the output devices is to include some emitter resistors, typically one ohm or so. Calculating the values of the circuit's resistors and capacitors is done based on the components employed and the intended use of the amp.\nNotes on implementation.\nAny real amplifier is an imperfect realization of an ideal amplifier. An important limitation of a real amplifier is that the output it generates is ultimately limited by the power available from the power supply. An amplifier saturates and clips the output if the input signal becomes too large for the amplifier to reproduce or exceeds operational limits for the device. The power supply may influence the output, so must be considered in the design. The power output from an amplifier cannot exceed its input power.\nThe amplifier circuit has an \"open loop\" performance. This is described by various parameters (gain, slew rate, output impedance, distortion, bandwidth, signal-to-noise ratio, etc.). Many modern amplifiers use negative feedback techniques to hold the gain at the desired value and reduce distortion. Negative loop feedback has the intended effect of lowering the output impedance and thereby increasing electrical damping of loudspeaker motion at and near the resonance frequency of the speaker.\nWhen assessing rated amplifier power output, it is useful to consider the applied load, the signal type (e.g., speech or music), required power output duration (i.e., short-time or continuous), and required dynamic range (e.g., recorded or live audio). In high-powered audio applications that require long cables to the load (e.g., cinemas and shopping centres) it may be more efficient to connect to the load at line output voltage, with matching transformers at source and loads. This avoids long runs of heavy speaker cables.\nTo prevent instability or overheating requires care to ensure solid state amplifiers are adequately loaded. Most have a rated minimum load impedance.\nAll amplifiers generate heat through electrical losses. The amplifier must dissipate this heat via convection or forced air cooling. Heat can damage or reduce electronic component service life. Designers and installers must also consider heating effects on adjacent equipment.\nDifferent power supply types result in many different methods of bias. Bias is a technique by which active devices are set to operate in a particular region, or by which the DC component of the output signal is set to the midpoint between the maximum voltages available from the power supply. Most amplifiers use several devices at each stage; they are typically matched in specifications except for polarity. Matched inverted polarity devices are called complementary pairs. Class-A amplifiers generally use only one device, unless the power supply is set to provide both positive and negative voltages, in which case a dual device symmetrical design may be used. Class-C amplifiers, by definition, use a single polarity supply.\nAmplifiers often have multiple stages in cascade to increase gain. Each stage of these designs may be a different type of amp to suit the needs of that stage. For instance, the first stage might be a class-A stage, feeding a class-AB push\u2013pull second stage, which then drives a class-G final output stage, taking advantage of the strengths of each type, while minimizing their weaknesses."}
{"id": "9932", "revid": "169132", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9932", "title": "Escort carrier", "text": "The escort carrier or escort aircraft carrier (U.S. hull classification symbol CVE), also called a \"jeep carrier\" or \"baby flattop\" in the United States Navy (USN) or \"Woolworth Carrier\" by the Royal Navy, was a small and slow type of aircraft carrier used by the Royal Navy, the United States Navy, the Imperial Japanese Navy and Imperial Japanese Army Air Force in World War II. They were typically half the length and a third the displacement of larger fleet carriers, slower, carried fewer planes, and more-lightly armed and armored. Escort carriers were most often built upon a commercial ship hull, so they were cheaper and could be built quickly. This was their principal advantage as they could be completed in greater numbers as a stop-gap when fleet carriers were scarce. However, the lack of protection made escort carriers particularly vulnerable, and several were sunk with great loss of life. The light carrier (U.S. hull classification symbol CVL) was a similar concept to the escort carrier in most respects, but was fast enough to operate alongside fleet carriers.\nEscort carriers were too slow to keep up with the main forces consisting of fleet carriers, battleships, and cruisers. Instead, they were used to escort convoys, defending them from enemy threats such as submarines and planes. In the invasions of mainland Europe and Pacific islands, escort carriers provided air support to ground forces during amphibious operations. Escort carriers also served as backup aircraft transports for fleet carriers, and ferried aircraft of all military services to points of delivery.\nIn the Battle of the Atlantic, escort carriers were used to protect convoys against U-boats. Initially escort carriers accompanied the merchant ships and helped to fend off attacks from aircraft and submarines. As numbers increased later in the war, escort carriers also formed part of hunter-killer groups that sought out submarines instead of being attached to a particular convoy.\nIn the Pacific theater, CVEs provided air support of ground troops in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. They lacked the speed and weapons to counter enemy fleets, relying on the protection of a Fast Carrier Task Force. However, at the Battle off Samar, one U.S. task force of escort carriers and destroyers managed to successfully defend itself against a much larger Japanese force of battleships and cruisers. The Japanese met a furious defense of carrier aircraft, screening destroyers, and destroyer escorts.\nOf the 151 aircraft carriers built in the U.S. during World War II, 122 were escort carriers, though no examples survive. The was the most numerous class of aircraft carrier, with 50 launched. Second was the , with 45 launched.\nDevelopment.\nIn the early 1920s, the Washington Naval Treaty imposed limits on the maximum size and total tonnage of aircraft carriers for the five main naval powers. Later treaties largely kept these provisions. As a result, construction between the World Wars had been insufficient to meet operational needs for aircraft carriers as World War II expanded from Europe. Too few fleet carriers were available to simultaneously transport aircraft to distant bases, support amphibious invasions, offer carrier landing training for replacement pilots, conduct anti-submarine patrols, and provide defensive air cover for deployed battleships and cruisers. The foregoing mission requirements limited use of fleet carriers' unique offensive strike capability demonstrated at the Battle of Taranto and the Attack on Pearl Harbor. Conversion of existing ships (and hulls under construction for other purposes) provided additional aircraft carriers until new construction became available.\nConversions of cruisers and passenger liners with speed similar to fleet carriers were identified by the U.S. as \"light aircraft carriers\" (hull classification symbol CVL) able to operate at battle fleet speeds. Slower conversions were classified as \"escort carriers\" and were considered naval auxiliaries suitable for pilot training and transport of aircraft to distant bases.\nThe Royal Navy had recognized a need for carriers to defend its trade routes in the 1930s. While designs had been prepared for \"trade protection carriers\" and five suitable liners identified for conversion, nothing further was done mostly because there were insufficient aircraft for even the fleet carriers under construction at the time. However, by 1940 the need had become urgent and was converted from the captured German merchant ship MV \"Hannover\" and commissioned in July 1941. For defense from German aircraft, convoys were supplied first with fighter catapult ships and CAM ships that could carry a single (disposable) fighter. In the interim, before escort carriers could be supplied, they also brought in merchant aircraft carriers that could operate four aircraft.\nIn 1940, U.S. Admiral William Halsey recommended construction of naval auxiliaries for pilot training. In early 1941 the British asked the U.S. to build on their behalf six carriers of an improved \"Audacity\" design, but the U.S. had already begun their own escort carrier. On 1 February 1941, the United States Chief of Naval Operations gave priority to construction of naval auxiliaries for aircraft transport. U.S. ships built to meet these needs were initially referred to as auxiliary aircraft escort vessels (AVG) in February 1942 and then auxiliary aircraft carrier (ACV) on 5 August 1942. The first U.S. example of the type was . Operation Torch and North Atlantic anti-submarine warfare proved these ships capable aircraft carriers for ship formations moving at the speed of trade or amphibious invasion convoys. U.S. classification revision to escort aircraft carrier (CVE) on 15 July 1943 reflected upgraded status from auxiliary to combatant. They were informally known as \"Jeep carriers\" or \"baby flattops\". It was quickly found that the escort carriers had better performance than light carriers, which tended to pitch badly in moderate to high seas. The was designed to incorporate the best features of American CVLs on a more stable hull with a less expensive propulsion system.\nAmong their crews, CVE was sarcastically said to stand for \"Combustible, Vulnerable, and Expendable\". Magazine protection was minimal in comparison to fleet aircraft carriers. was sunk within minutes by a single torpedo, and exploded from undetermined causes with very heavy loss of life. Three escort carriers\u2014, and \u2014were destroyed by kamikazes, the largest ships to meet such a fate.\nAllied escort carriers were typically around long, not much more than half the length of the almost fleet carriers of the same era, but were less than of the weight. A typical escort carrier displaced about , as compared to almost for a full-size fleet carrier. The aircraft hangar typically ran only of the way under the flight deck and housed a combination of 24\u201330 fighters and bombers organized into one single \"composite squadron\". By comparison, a late \"Essex\"-class fleet carrier of the period could carry 103 aircraft organized into separate fighter, bomber and torpedo-bomber squadrons.\nThe island (superstructure) on these ships was small and cramped, and located well forward of the funnels (unlike on a normal-sized carrier, where the funnels were integrated into the island). Although the first escort carriers had only one aircraft elevator, having two elevators (one fore and one aft), along with the single aircraft catapult, quickly became standard. The carriers employed the same system of arresting cables and tail hooks as on the big carriers, and procedures for launch and recovery were the same as well.\nThe crew size was less than of that of a large carrier, but this was still a bigger complement than most naval vessels. U.S. escort carriers were large enough to have facilities such as a permanent canteen or snack bar, called a gedunk bar, in addition to the mess. The bar was open for longer hours than the mess and sold several flavors of ice cream, along with cigarettes and other consumables. There were also several vending machines available on board.\nIn all, 130 Allied escort carriers were launched or converted during the war. Of these, six were British conversions of merchant ships: , , , , and . The remaining escort carriers were U.S.-built. Like the British, the first U.S. escort carriers were converted merchant vessels (or in the , converted military oilers). The \"Bogue\"-class carriers were based on the hull of the Type C3 cargo ship. The last 69 escort carriers of the and \"Commencement Bay\" classes were purpose-designed and purpose-built carriers drawing on the experience gained with the previous classes.\nRoyal Navy.\nOriginally developed at the behest of the United Kingdom to operate as part of a North Atlantic convoy escort, rather than as part of a naval strike force, many of the escort carriers produced were assigned to the Royal Navy for the duration of the war under the Lend-Lease act. They supplemented and then replaced the converted merchant aircraft carriers that were put into service by the British and Dutch as an emergency measure until dedicated escort carriers became available. As convoy escorts, they were used by the Royal Navy to provide air scouting, to ward off enemy long-range scouting aircraft and, increasingly, to spot and hunt submarines. Often additional escort carriers joined convoys, not as fighting ships but as transporters, ferrying aircraft from the U.S. to Britain; twice as many aircraft could be carried by storing aircraft on the flight deck as well as in the hangar.\nThe ships sent to the Royal Navy were slightly modified, partly to suit the traditions of that service. Among other things the ice-cream making machines were removed, since they were considered unnecessary luxuries on ships which provided a grog ration. The heavy duty washing machines of the laundry room were removed, since \"all a British sailor needs to keep clean is a bucket and a bar of soap\" (quoted from Warrilow).\nOther modifications were due to the need for a completely enclosed hangar when operating in the North Atlantic and in support of the Arctic convoys.\nU.S. Navy service.\nThe attack on Pearl Harbor brought up an urgent need for aircraft carriers, so some T3 tankers were converted to escort carriers; is an example of how a T3 tanker hull, AO-33, was rebuilt to be an escort carrier. The T3 tanker size and speed made the T3 a useful escort carrier. There were two classes of T3 hull carriers: \"Sangamon\" class and \"Commencement Bay\" class.\nThe U.S. discovered their own uses for escort carriers. In the North Atlantic, they supplemented the escorting destroyers by providing air support for anti-submarine warfare. One of these escort carriers, , was instrumental in the capture of off North Africa in 1944.\nIn the Pacific theater, escort carriers lacked the speed to sail with fast carrier attack groups, so were often tasked to escort the landing ships and troop carriers during the island-hopping campaign. In this role they provided air cover for the troopships and flew the first wave of attacks on beach fortifications in amphibious landing operations. On occasion, they even escorted the large carriers, serving as emergency airstrips and providing fighter cover for their larger sisters while these were busy readying or refueling their own planes. They also transported aircraft and spare parts from the U.S. to remote island airstrips.\nBattle off Samar.\nA battle in which escort carriers played a major role was the Battle off Samar in the Philippines on 25 October 1944. The Japanese lured Admiral William Halsey, Jr. into chasing a decoy fleet with his powerful 3rd Fleet. This left about 450 aircraft from 16 small and slow escort carriers in three task units (\"Taffies\"), armed primarily to bomb ground forces, and their protective screen of destroyers and slower destroyer escorts to protect undefended troop and supply ships in Leyte Gulf. No Japanese threat was believed to be in the area, but a force of four battleships, including the formidable , eight cruisers, and 11 destroyers, appeared, sailing towards Leyte Gulf. Only the Taffies were in the way of the Japanese attack.\nThe slow carriers could not outrun cruisers. They launched their aircraft and maneuvered to avoid shellfire, helped by smoke screens, for over an hour. \"Taffy 3\" bore the brunt of the fight. The Taffy ships took dozens of hits, mostly from armor-piercing rounds that passed right through their thin, unarmored hulls without exploding. , sunk in this action, was the only U.S. carrier lost to enemy surface gunfire in the war; the Japanese concentration of fire on this one carrier assisted the escape of the others. The carriers' only substantial armament\u2014aside from their aircraft\u2014was a single dual-purpose gun mounted on the stern, but the pursuing Japanese cruisers closed to within range of these guns. One of the guns damaged the burning Japanese heavy cruiser , and a subsequent bomb dropped by an aircraft hit the cruiser's forward machinery room, leaving her dead in the water. A \"kamikaze\" attack sank ; \"kamikaze\" aircraft attacking other ships were shot down. Ultimately the superior Japanese surface force withdrew, believing they were confronted by a stronger force than was the case. Most of the damage to the Japanese fleet was inflicted by torpedoes fired by destroyers, and bombs from the carriers' aircraft.\nThe U.S. Navy lost a similar number of ships and more men than in the battles of the Coral Sea and Midway combined (though major fleet carriers were lost in the other battles).\nThe ships.\nMany escort carriers were Lend-Leased to the United Kingdom, this list specifies the breakdown in service to each navy.\nIn addition, six escort carriers were converted from other types by the British during the war.\nThe table below lists escort carriers and similar ships performing the same missions. The first four were built as early fleet aircraft carriers. Merchant aircraft carriers (MAC) carried trade cargo in addition to operating aircraft. Aircraft transports carried larger numbers of planes by eliminating accommodation for operating personnel and storage of fuel and ammunition.\nPost-World War II.\nThe years following World War II brought many revolutionary new technologies to naval aviation, most notably the helicopter and the jet fighter, and with this a complete rethinking of its strategies and ships' tasks. Although several of the latest \"Commencement Bay\"-class CVE were deployed as floating airfields during the Korean War, the main reasons for the development of the escort carrier had disappeared or could be dealt with better by newer weapons. The emergence of the helicopter meant that helicopter-deck equipped frigates could now take over the CVE's role in a convoy while also performing their usual role as submarine hunters. Ship-mounted guided missile launchers took over much of the aircraft protection role, and in-flight refueling eliminated the need for floating stopover points for transport or patrol aircraft. Consequently, after the \"Commencement Bay\" class, no new escort carriers were designed, and with every downsizing of the navy, the CVEs were the first to be mothballed.\nSeveral escort carriers were pressed back into service during the first years of the Vietnam War because of their ability to carry large numbers of aircraft. Redesignated AKV (air transport auxiliary), they were manned by a civilian crew and used to ferry whole aircraft and spare parts from the U.S. to Army, Air Force and Marine bases in South Vietnam. However, CVEs were useful in this role only for a limited period. Once all major aircraft were equipped with refueling probes, it became much easier to fly the aircraft directly to its base instead of shipping it.\nThe last chapter in the history of escort carriers consisted of two conversions: as an experiment, was converted from an aircraft carrier into a pure helicopter carrier (CVHA-1) and used by the Marine Corps to carry assault helicopters for the first wave of amphibious warfare operations. Later, \"Thetis Bay\" became a full amphibious assault ship (LHP-6). Although in service only from 1955 (the year of her conversion) to 1964, the experience gained in her training exercises greatly influenced the design of today's amphibious assault ships.\nIn the second conversion, in 1961, had all her aircraft handling equipment removed and four tall radio antennas installed on her long, flat deck. In lieu of aircraft, the hangar deck now had 24 military radio transmitter trucks bolted to its floor. Rechristened , the ship was used as a communication relay ship and served dutifully through the Vietnam War as a floating radio station, relaying transmissions between the forces on the ground and the command centers back home. Like \"Thetis Bay\", the experience gained before \"Annapolis\" was stricken in 1976 helped develop today's purpose-built amphibious command ships of the .\nUnlike almost all other major classes of ships and patrol boats from World War II, most of which can be found in a museum or port, no escort carrier or American light carrier has survived; all were destroyed during the war or broken up in the following decades. The Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships records that the last former escort carrier remaining in naval service\u2014USS \"Annapolis\"\u2014was sold for scrapping 19 December 1979. The last American light carrier (the escort carrier's faster sister type) was , which was broken up in 2002 after a decade-long attempt to preserve the vessel.\nThe U.S.-designed the Sea Control Ship to serve a similar role; while none were actually built, the and the Thai are based on the concept.\nSee also.\nFor complete lists see:"}
{"id": "9933", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9933", "title": "Extreme sport", "text": "Action sports, adventure sports or extreme sports are activities perceived as involving a high degree of risk. These activities often involve speed, height, a high level of physical exertion and highly specialized gear.\nDefinition.\nThe definition of extreme sports is not exact and the origin of the terms is unclear, but it gained popularity in the 1990s when it was picked up by marketing companies to promote the X Games and when the Extreme Sports Channel and the Extreme Sports Company launched. More recently, the commonly used definition from research is \"a competitive (comparison or self-evaluative) activity within which the participant is subjected to natural or unusual physical and mental challenges such as speed, height, depth or natural forces and where fast and accurate cognitive perceptual processing may be required for a successful outcome\" by Dr. Rhonda Cohen (2012).\nWhile the use of the term \"extreme sport\" has spread everywhere to describe a multitude of different activities, exactly which sports are considered 'extreme' is debatable. There are, however, several characteristics common to most extreme sports. While they are not the exclusive domain of youth, extreme sports tend to have a younger-than-average target demographic. Extreme sports are also rarely sanctioned by schools for their physical education curriculum. Extreme sports tend to be more solitary than many of the popular traditional sports (rafting and paintballing are notable exceptions, as they are done in teams).\nActivities categorized by media as extreme sports differ from traditional sports due to the higher number of inherently uncontrollable variables. These environmental variables are frequently weather and terrain related, including wind, snow, water and mountains. Because these natural phenomena cannot be controlled, they inevitably affect the outcome of the given activity or event.\nIn a traditional sporting event, athletes compete against each other under controlled circumstances. While it is possible to create a controlled sporting event such as X Games, there are environmental variables that cannot be held constant for all athletes. Examples include changing snow conditions for snowboarders, rock and ice quality for climbers, and wave height and shape for surfers.\nWhilst traditional sporting judgment criteria may be adopted when assessing performance (distance, time, score, etc.), extreme sports performers are often evaluated on more subjective and aesthetic criteria. This results in a tendency to reject unified judging methods, with different sports employing their own ideals and indeed having the ability to evolve their assessment standards with new trends or developments in the sports.\nClassification.\nWhile the exact definition and what is included as extreme sport is debatable, some attempted to make classification for extreme sports.\nOne argument is that to qualify as an \"extreme sport\" both expression terms need to be fulfilled;\nAlong this definition, being a passenger in a canyon jet boat ride will not fulfill the requirements as the skill required pertains to the pilot, not the passengers. \"Thrill seeking\" might be a more suitable qualification than \"extreme sport\" or \"action sport\" in these cases.\nWith the exception of skateboarding, inline skating, freestyle BMX and parkour, most extreme sports are also considered \"adventure sports\" and typically take place in the natural outdoors. Extreme sports may be subdivided into:\nExtreme vehicle sports.\nThese sports require the use of snow, ice or water sports (\"sports de glisse\" in French) and rolling sports. Another subdivision can be made along motorized and non-motorized vehicle sports, resulting in the following matrix;\nExtreme non-vehicle sports.\nNo type of vehicle is required (rock climbing, BASE jumping, bungee jumping, canyoning, ice climbing, parkour, deep-water soloing, etc.)\nHistory.\nThe origin of the divergence of the term \"extreme sports\" from \"sports\" may date to the 1950s in the appearance of a phrase usually, but wrongly, attributed to Ernest Hemingway. The phrase is;\nThere are only three sports: bullfighting, motor racing, and mountaineering; all the rest are merely games.\nThe implication of the phrase was that the word \"sport\" defined an activity in which one might be killed. The other activities being termed \"games\". The phrase may have been invented by either writer Barnaby Conrad or automotive author Ken Purdy.\nThe Dangerous Sports Club of Oxford University, England was founded by David Kirke, Chris Baker, Ed Hulton and Alan Weston. They first came to wide public attention by inventing modern day bungee jumping, by making the first modern jumps on 1 April 1979, from the Clifton Suspension Bridge, Bristol, England. They followed the Clifton Bridge effort with a jump from the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California (including the first female bungee jump by Jane Wilmot), and with a televised leap from the Royal Gorge Suspension Bridge in Colorado, sponsored by and televised on the popular American television program \"That's Incredible!\" Bungee jumping was treated as a novelty for a few years, then became a craze for young people, and is now an established industry for thrill seekers.\nThe Club also pioneered a surrealist form of skiing, holding three events at St. Moritz, Switzerland, in which competitors were required to devise a sculpture mounted on skis and ride it down a mountain. The event reached its limits when the Club arrived in St. Moritz with a London double-decker bus, wanting to send it down the ski slopes, and the Swiss resort managers refused.\nOther Club activities included expedition hang gliding from active volcanoes; the launching of giant (20\u00a0m) plastic spheres with pilots suspended in the centre (zorbing); microlight flying; and BASE jumping (in the early days of this sport).\nIn recent decades the term \"extreme sport\" was further promoted after the Extreme Sports Channel, Extremesportscompany.com launched and then the X Games, a multi-sport event was created and developed by ESPN. The first X Games (known as 1995 Extreme Games) were held in Newport, Providence, Mount Snow, and Vermont in the United States.\nCertain extreme sports clearly trace back to other extreme sports, or combinations thereof. For example, windsurfing was conceived as a result of efforts to equip a surfboard with a sailing boat's propulsion system (mast and sail). Kitesurfing on the other hand was conceived by combining the propulsion system of kite buggying (a parafoil) with the bi-directional boards used for wakeboarding. Wakeboarding is in turn derived from snowboarding and waterskiing.\nMarketing.\nSome contend that the distinction between an extreme sport and a conventional one has as much to do with marketing as with the level of danger involved or the adrenaline generated. For example, rugby union is both dangerous and adrenaline-inducing but is not considered an extreme sport due to its traditional image, and because it does not involve high speed or an intention to perform stunts (the aesthetic criteria mentioned above) and also it does not have changing environmental variables for the athletes.\nMotivation.\nA feature of such activities in the view of some is their alleged capacity to induce an adrenaline rush in participants. However, the medical view is that the rush or high associated with the activity is not due to adrenaline being released as a response to fear, but due to increased levels of dopamine, endorphins and serotonin because of the high level of physical exertion. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that the link to adrenaline and 'true' extreme sports is tentative. Brymer and Gray's study defined 'true' extreme sports as a leisure or recreation activity where the most likely outcome of a mismanaged accident or mistake was death. This definition was designed to separate the marketing hype from the activity.\nEric Brymer also found that the potential of various extraordinary human experiences, many of which parallel those found in activities such as meditation, was an important part of the extreme sport experience. Those experiences put the participants outside their comfort zone and are often done in conjunction with adventure travel.\nSome of the sports have existed for decades and their proponents span generations, some going on to become well known personalities. Rock climbing and ice climbing have spawned publicly recognizable names such as Edmund Hillary, Chris Bonington, Wolfgang G\u00fcllich and more recently Joe Simpson. Another example is surfing, invented centuries ago by the inhabitants of Polynesia, it will become national sport of Hawaii.\nDisabled people participate in extreme sports. Nonprofit organizations such as Adaptive Action Sports seek to increase awareness of the participation in action sports by members of the disabled community, as well as increase access to the adaptive technologies that make participation possible and to competitions such as The X Games.\nMortality.\nExtreme sports by their nature can be extremely dangerous, conducive to fatalities, near-fatalities and other serious injuries, and sometimes consist in treading along the brink of death. This imminent and inherent danger in an extreme sport has been considered a somewhat necessary part of its appeal, which is partially a result of pressure for athletes to make more money and provide maximum entertainment.\nHealth.\nExtreme sports is a sub-category of sports that are described as any kind of sport \"of a character or kind farthest removed from the ordinary or average\". These kinds of sports often carry out the potential risk of serious and permanent physical injury and even death. However, these sports also have the potential to produce drastic benefits on mental and physical health and provide opportunity for individuals to engage fully with life.\nExtreme sports trigger the release of the hormone adrenaline, which can facilitate performance of stunts. However, with a bad mix of other hormones it can lead people to execute terrible actions. It is believed that the implementation of extreme sports on mental health patients improves their perspective and recognition of aspects of life.\nThrill.\nIn outdoor adventure sports, participants get to experience the emotion of intense thrill, usually associated with the extreme sports. Even though some extreme sports present a higher level of risk, people still choose to embark in the experience of extreme sports for the sake of the adrenaline. According to Sigmund Freud, we have an instinctual 'death wish', which is a subconscious inbuilt desire to destroy ourselves, proving that in the seek for the thrill, danger is considered pleasurable."}

She had an older sister, Eadgifu.\nAt the request of the East Frankish king Henry the Fowler, who wished to stake a claim to equality and to seal the alliance between the two Saxon kingdoms, her half-brother King \u00c6thelstan sent his sisters Edith and Edgiva to Germany. Henry's eldest son and heir to the throne Otto was instructed to choose whichever one pleased him best. Otto chose Edith, according to Hrotsvitha a woman \"of pure noble countenance, graceful character and truly royal appearance\", and married her in 930. \nIn 936 Henry the Fowler died and his eldest son Otto, Edith's husband, was crowned king at Aachen Cathedral. A surviving report of the ceremony by the medieval chronicler Widukind of Corvey makes no mention of his wife having been crowned at this point, but according to Bishop Thietmar of Merseburg's chronicle, Eadgyth was nevertheless anointed as queen, albeit in a separate ceremony. \nAs queen consort, Edith undertook the usual state duties of a \"First Lady\": when she turns up in the records it is generally in connection with gifts to the state's favoured monasteries or memorials to holy women and saints. In this respect she seems to have been more diligent than her now widowed and subsequently sainted mother-in-law, Queen Matilda, whose own charitable activities only achieve a single recorded mention from the period of Eadgyth's time as queen. There was probably rivalry between the Benedictine founded at Magdeburg by Otto and Eadgyth in 937, a year after coming to the throne, and Matilda's foundation Quedlinburg Abbey, intended by her as a memorial to her husband, the late King Henry. Edith accompanied her husband on his travels, though not during battles. While Otto fought against the rebellious dukes Eberhard of Franconia and Gilbert of Lorraine in 939, she spent the hostilities at Lorsch Abbey.\nLike her brother, \u00c6thelstan, Edith was devoted to the cult of their ancestor Saint Oswald of Northumbria and was instrumental in introducing this cult into Germany after her marriage to the emperor. Her lasting influence may have caused certain monasteries and churches in the Duchy of Saxony to be dedicated to this saint.\nEadgyth's death in 946 at a relatively young age, in her thirties, was unexpected. Otto apparently mourned the loss of a beloved spouse. He married Adelaide of Italy in 951.\nChildren.\nEdith and Otto's children were:\nboth buried in St. Alban's Abbey, Mainz.\nTomb.\nInitially buried in the St Maurice monastery, Edith's tomb since the 16th century has been located in Magdeburg Cathedral. Long regarded as a cenotaph, a lead coffin inside a stone sarcophagus with her name on it was found and opened in 2008 by archaeologists during work on the building. An inscription recorded that it was the body of Eadgyth, reburied in 1510. The fragmented and incomplete bones were examined in 2009, then brought to Bristol, England, for tests in 2010. \nThe investigations at Bristol, applying isotope tests on tooth enamel, checked whether she was born and brought up in Wessex and Mercia, as written history indicated. Testing on the bones revealed that they are the remains of Eadgyth, from study made of the enamel of the teeth in her upper jaw. Testing of the enamel revealed that the individual entombed at Magdeburg had spent time as a youth in the chalky uplands of Wessex. The bones are the oldest found of a member of English royalty.\nFollowing the tests the bones were re-interred in a new titanium coffin in her tomb at Magdeburg Cathedral on 22 October 2010.\nExternal links.\n "}
{"id": "9937", "revid": "22982520", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9937", "title": "Kingdom of Essex", "text": "The Kingdom of the East Saxons (; ), today referred to as the Kingdom of Essex , was one of the seven traditional kingdoms of the Anglo-Saxon Heptarchy. It was founded in the 6th century and covered the territory later occupied by the counties of Essex, Hertfordshire, Middlesex and (for a short while) Kent. The last king of Essex was Sigered of Essex and in 825, he ceded the kingdom to Ecgberht, King of Wessex.\nExtent.\nThe kingdom was bounded to the north by the River Stour and the Kingdom of East Anglia, to the south by the River Thames and Kent, to the east lay the North Sea and to the west Mercia. The territory included the remains of two provincial Roman capitals, Colchester and London. The early kingdom included the land of the Middle Saxons, later Middlesex, most if not all of Hertfordshire and may at times have included Surrey. For a brief period in the 8th century, the Kingdom of Essex controlled what is now Kent.\nThe inclusion of these additional areas was reflected by their inclusion in the Diocese of London, the East Saxon see, which from 604 until 1846 included Essex, Middlesex and parts (the full extent is unknown) of Hertfordshire. Charter evidence shows that the Kings of Essex appear to have had a greater control in the core area, east of the Lea and Stort, that would subsequently become the county of Essex. In the core area they granted charters freely, but further west they did so while also making reference to their Mercian overlords.\nThe modern English county of Essex maintains the historic northern and the southern borders, but only covers the territory east of the River Lea, the other parts being lost to neighbouring Mercia during the 8th century.\nIn the Tribal Hidage it is listed as containing 7,000 hides.\nHistory.\nAlthough the kingdom of Essex was one of the kingdoms of the Heptarchy, its history is not well documented. It produced relatively few Anglo-Saxon charters and no version of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\"; in fact the only mention in the chronicle concerns Bishop Mellitus. As a result, the kingdom is regarded as comparatively obscure. For most of the kingdom's existence, the Essex king was subservient to an overlord \u2013 variously the kings of Kent, Anglia or Mercia.\nOrigin.\nSaxon occupation of land that was to form the kingdom had begun by the early 5th century at Mucking and other locations. A large proportion of these original settlers came from Old Saxony. According to British legend (see: Historia Brittonum) the territory known later as Essex was ceded by the Celtic Britons to the Saxons following the infamous Treachery of the Long Knives, which occurred ca. 460 during the reign of High King Vortigern. Della Hooke relates the territory ruled by the kings of Essex to the pre-Roman territory of the Trinovantes.\nThe kingdom of Essex grew by the absorption of smaller subkingdoms or Saxon tribal groups. There are a number of suggestions for the location of these subkingdoms including:\nEssex monarchy.\nEssex emerged as a single kingdom during the 6th century. The dates, names and achievements of the Essex kings, like those of most early rulers in the Heptarchy, remain conjectural. The historical identification of the kings of Essex, including the evidence and a reconstructed genealogy are discussed extensively by Yorke. The dynasty claimed descent from Woden via Seaxn\u0113at. A genealogy of the Essex royal house was prepared in Wessex in the 9th century. Unfortunately the surviving copy is somewhat mutilated. At times during the history of the kingdom several sub-kings within Essex appear to have been able to rule simultaneously. They may have exercised authority over different parts of the kingdom. The first recorded king, according to the East Saxon King List, was \u00c6scwine of Essex, to which a date of 527 is given for the start of his reign, although there are some difficulties with the date of his reign, and Sledd of Essex is listed as the founder of the Essex royal house by other sources.\nThe Essex kings issued coins that echoed those issued by Cunobeline simultaneously asserting a link to the first century rulers while emphasising independence from Mercia.\nThe tomb of S\u00e6bbi of Essex (r.664\u2013683) was visible in Old St Paul's Cathedral until the Great Fire of London of 1666 when the cathedral and the tombs within it were lost.\nChristianity.\nThe earliest English record of the kingdom dates to Bede's \"Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum\", which noted the arrival of Bishop (later Saint) Mellitus in London in 604. \u00c6thelberht (King of Kent and overlord of southern England according to Bede) was in a position to exercise some authority in Essex shortly after 604, when his intervention helped in the conversion of King Saebert of Essex (son of Sledd), his nephew, to Christianity. It was \u00c6thelberht, and not S\u00e6berht, who built and endowed St. Pauls in London, where St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral now stands. Bede describes \u00c6thelberht as S\u00e6berht\u2019s overlord. After the death of Saebert in AD 616, Mellitus was driven out and the kingdom reverted to paganism. This may have been the result of opposition to Kentish influence in Essex affairs rather than being specifically anti-Christian.\nThe kingdom reconverted to Christianity under Sigeberht II the Good following a mission by St Cedd who established monasteries at \"Tilaburg\" (probably East Tilbury, but possibly West Tilbury) and \"Ithancester\" (almost certainly Bradwell-on-Sea). A royal tomb at Prittlewell was discovered and excavated in 2003. Finds included gold foil crosses, suggesting the occupant was Christian. If the occupant was a king, it was probably either Saebert or Sigeberht (murdered AD 653). It is, however, also possible that the occupant was not royal, but simply a wealthy and powerful individual whose identity has gone unrecorded.\nEssex reverted to Paganism again in 660 with the ascension of the Pagan King Swithelm of Essex. He converted in 662, but died in 664. He was succeeded by his two sons, Sigehere and S\u00e6bbi. A plague the same year caused Sigehere and his people to recant their Christianity and Essex reverted to Paganism a third time. This rebellion was suppressed by Wulfhere of Mercia who established himself as overlord. Bede describes Sigehere and S\u00e6bbi as \"rulers \u2026 under Wulfhere, king of the Mercians\". Wulfhere sent Jaruman, the bishop of Lichfield, to reconvert the East Saxons.\nWine (in 666) and Erkenwald (in 675) were appointed bishops of London with spiritual authority over the East Saxon Kingdom. Although London (and the rest of Middlesex) was lost by the East Saxons in the 8th century, the bishops of London continued to exert spiritual authority over Essex as a kingdom, shire and county until 1845.\nLater history and end.\nDespite the comparative obscurity of the kingdom, there were strong connections between Essex and the Kentish kingdom across the river Thames which led to the marriage of King Sledd to Ricula, sister of the king, Aethelbert of Kent. For a brief period in the 8th century the kingdom included west Kent. During this period, Essex kings were issuing their own sceattas (coins), perhaps as an assertion of their own independence. However, by the mid 8th century much of the kingdom, including London, had fallen to Mercia and the rump of Essex, roughly the modern county, was now subordinate to the same. After the defeat of the Mercian king Beornwulf around AD 825, Sigered, the last king of Essex, ceded the kingdom which then became a possession of the Wessex king Egbert.\nThe Mercians continued to control parts of Essex and may have supported a pretender to the Essex throne since a Sigeric \"rex Orientalem Saxonum\" witnessed a Mercian charter after AD 825. During the ninth century, Essex was part of a sub-kingdom that included Sussex, Surrey and Kent. Sometime between 878 and 886, the territory was formally ceded by Wessex to the Danelaw kingdom of East Anglia, under the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum. After the reconquest by Edward the Elder the king's representative in Essex was styled an ealdorman and Essex came to be regarded as a shire.\nList of kings.\nThe following list of kings may omit whole generations."}

The eighth-century monk Bede, in his \"Ecclesiastical History of the English People\", lists him as the third king to hold \"imperium\" over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. In the late ninth century \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", he is referred to as a \"bretwalda\", or \"Britain-ruler\". He was the first English king to convert to Christianity.\n\u00c6thelberht was the son of Eormenric, succeeding him as king, according to the \"Chronicle\". He married Bertha, the Christian daughter of Charibert I, king of the Franks, thus building an alliance with the most powerful state in contemporary Western Europe; the marriage probably took place before he came to the throne. Bertha's influence may have led to Pope Gregory I's decision to send Augustine as a missionary from Rome. Augustine landed on the Isle of Thanet in east Kent in 597. Shortly thereafter, \u00c6thelberht converted to Christianity, churches were established, and wider-scale conversion to Christianity began in the kingdom. He provided the new church with land in Canterbury, thus helping to establish one of the foundation stones of English Christianity.\n\u00c6thelberht's law for Kent, the earliest written code in any Germanic language, instituted a complex system of fines; the law code is preserved in the \"Textus Roffensis\". Kent was rich, with strong trade ties to the Continent, and \u00c6thelberht may have instituted royal control over trade. Coinage probably began circulating in Kent during his reign for the first time since the Anglo-Saxon settlement. He later came to be regarded as a saint for his role in establishing Christianity among the Anglo-Saxons. His feast day was originally 24 February but was changed to 25 February.\nHistorical context.\nIn the fifth century, raids on Britain by continental peoples had developed into full-scale migrations. The newcomers are known to have included Angles, Saxons, Jutes and Frisians, and there is evidence of other groups as well. These groups captured territory in the east and south of England, but at about the end of the fifth century, a British victory at the battle of Mount Badon (Mons Badonicus) halted the Anglo-Saxon advance for fifty years. From about 550, however, the British began to lose ground once more, and within twenty-five years it appears that control of almost all of southern England was in the hands of the invaders.\nAnglo-Saxons probably conquered Kent before Mons Badonicus. There is both documentary and archaeological evidence that Kent was primarily colonised by Jutes, from the southern part of the Jutland peninsula. According to legend, the brothers Hengist and Horsa landed in 449 as mercenaries for a British king, Vortigern. After a rebellion over pay and Horsa's death in battle, Hengist established the Kingdom of Kent. Some historians now think the underlying story of a rebelling mercenary force may be accurate; most now date the founding of the kingdom of Kent to the middle of the fifth-century, which is consistent with the legend. This early date, only a few decades after the departure of the Romans, also suggests that more of Roman civilization may have survived into Anglo-Saxon rule in Kent than in other areas.\nOverlordship was a central feature of Anglo-Saxon politics which began before \u00c6thelberht's time; kings were described as overlords as late as the ninth century. The Anglo-Saxon invasion may have involved military coordination of different groups within the invaders, with a leader who had authority over many different groups; \u00c6lle of Sussex may have been such a leader. Once the new states began to form, conflicts among them began. Tribute from dependents could lead to wealth. A weaker state also might ask or pay for the protection of a stronger neighbour against a warlike third state.\nSources for this period in Kentish history include the \"Ecclesiastical History of the English People\", written in 731 by Bede, a Northumbrian monk. Bede was interested primarily in England's Christianization. Since \u00c6thelberht was the first Anglo-Saxon king to convert to Christianity, Bede provides more substantial information about him than about any earlier king. One of Bede's correspondents was Albinus, abbot of the monastery of St. Peter and St. Paul (subsequently renamed St. Augustine's) in Canterbury. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", a collection of annals assembled c. 890 in the kingdom of Wessex, mentions several events in Kent during \u00c6thelberht's reign. Further mention of events in Kent occurs in the late sixth century history of the Franks by Gregory of Tours. This is the earliest surviving source to mention any Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Some of Pope Gregory the Great's letters concern the mission of St. Augustine to Kent in 597; these letters also mention the state of Kent and its relationships with neighbours. Other sources include regnal lists of the kings of Kent and early charters (land grants by kings to their followers or to the church). Although no originals survive from \u00c6thelberht's reign, later copies exist. A law code from \u00c6thelberht's reign also survives.\nAncestry, accession and chronology.\nAccording to Bede, \u00c6thelberht was descended directly from Hengist. Bede gives the line of descent as follows: \"Ethelbert was son of Irminric, son of Octa, and after his grandfather Oeric, surnamed Oisc, the kings of the Kentish folk are commonly known as Oiscings. The father of Oeric was Hengist.\" An alternative form of this genealogy, found in the \"Historia Brittonum\" among other places, reverses the position of Octa and Oisc in the lineage. The first of these names that can be placed historically with reasonable confidence is \u00c6thelberht's father, whose name now usually is spelled Eormenric. The only direct written reference to Eormenric is in Kentish genealogies, but Gregory of Tours does mention that \u00c6thelberht's father was the king of Kent, though Gregory gives no date. Eormenric's name provides a hint of connections to the kingdom of the Franks, across the English channel; the element \"Eormen\" was rare in names of the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy, but much more common among Frankish nobles. One other member of \u00c6thelberht's family is known: his sister, Ricole, who is recorded by both Bede and the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" as the mother of S\u00e6berht, king of the East Saxons (i.e., Essex).\nThe dates of \u00c6thelberht's birth and accession to the throne of Kent are both matters of debate. Bede, the earliest source to give dates, is thought to have drawn his information from correspondence with Albinus. Bede states that when \u00c6thelberht died in 616 he had reigned for fifty-six years, placing his accession in 560. Bede also says that \u00c6thelberht died twenty-one years after his baptism. Augustine's mission from Rome is known to have arrived in 597, and according to Bede, it was this mission that converted \u00c6thelberht. Hence Bede's dates are inconsistent. The \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\", an important source for early dates, is inconsistent with Bede and also has inconsistencies among different manuscript versions. Putting together the different dates in the \"Chronicle\" for birth, death and length of reign, it appears that \u00c6thelberht's reign was thought to have been either 560\u2013616 or 565\u2013618 but that the surviving sources have confused the two traditions.\nIt is possible that \u00c6thelberht was converted to Christianity before Augustine's arrival. \u00c6thelberht's wife was a Christian and brought a Frankish bishop with her, to attend her at court, so \u00c6thelberht would have had knowledge of Christianity before the mission reached Kent. It also is possible that Bede had the date of \u00c6thelberht's death wrong; if, in fact, \u00c6thelberht died in 618, this would be consistent with his baptism in 597, which is in accord with the tradition that Augustine converted the king within a year of his arrival.\nGregory of Tours, in his \"Historia Francorum\", writes that Bertha, daughter of Charibert I, king of the Franks, married the son of the king of Kent. Bede says that \u00c6thelberht received Bertha \"from her parents\". If Bede is interpreted literally, the marriage would have had to take place before 567, when Charibert died. The traditions for \u00c6thelberht's reign, then, would imply that \u00c6thelberht married Bertha before either 560 or 565.\nThe extreme length of \u00c6thelberht's reign also has been regarded with skepticism by historians; it has been suggested that he died in the fifty-sixth year of his life, rather than the fifty-sixth year of his reign. This would place the year of his birth approximately at 560, and he would not then have been able to marry until the mid 570s. According to Gregory of Tours, Charibert was king when he married Ingoberg, Bertha's mother, which places that marriage no earlier than 561. It therefore is unlikely that Bertha was married much before about 580. These later dates for Bertha and \u00c6thelberht also solve another possible problem: \u00c6thelberht's daughter, \u00c6thelburh, seems likely to have been Bertha's child, but the earlier dates would have Bertha aged sixty or so at \u00c6thelburh's likely birthdate using the early dates.\nGregory, however, also says that he thinks that Ingoberg was seventy years old in 589; and this would make her about forty when she married Charibert. This is possible, but seems unlikely, especially as Charibert seems to have had a preference for younger women, again according to Gregory's account. This would imply an earlier birth date for Bertha. On the other hand, Gregory refers to \u00c6thelberht at the time of his marriage to Bertha simply as \"a man of Kent\", and in the 589 passage concerning Ingoberg's death, which was written in about 590 or 591, he refers to \u00c6thelberht as \"the son of the king of Kent\". If this does not simply reflect Gregory's ignorance of Kentish affairs, which seems unlikely given the close ties between Kent and the Franks, then some assert that \u00c6thelberht's reign cannot have begun before 589.\nWhile all of the contradictions above cannot be reconciled, the most probable dates that may be drawn from available data place \u00c6thelberht's birth at approximately 560 and, perhaps, his marriage to Bertha at 580. His reign is most likely to have begun in 589 or 590.\nKingship of Kent.\nThe later history of Kent shows clear evidence of a system of joint kingship, with the kingdom being divided into east Kent and west Kent, although it appears that there generally was a dominant king. This evidence is less clear for the earlier period, but there are early charters, known to be forged, which nevertheless imply that \u00c6thelberht ruled as joint king with his son, Eadbald. It may be that \u00c6thelberht was king of east Kent and Eadbald became king of west Kent; the east Kent king seems generally to have been the dominant ruler later in Kentish history. Whether or not Eadbald became a joint king with \u00c6thelberht, there is no question that \u00c6thelberht had authority throughout the kingdom.\nThe division into two kingdoms is most likely to date back to the sixth century; east Kent may have conquered west Kent and preserved the institutions of kingship as a subkingdom. This was a common pattern in Anglo-Saxon England, as the more powerful kingdoms absorbed their weaker neighbours. An unusual feature of the Kentish system was that only sons of kings appeared to be legitimate claimants to the throne, although this did not eliminate all strife over the succession.\nThe main towns of the two kingdoms were Rochester, for west Kent, and Canterbury, for east Kent. Bede does not state that \u00c6thelberht had a palace in Canterbury, but he does refer to Canterbury as \u00c6thelberht's \"metropolis\", and it is clear that it is \u00c6thelberht's seat.\nRelations with the Franks.\nThere are many indications of close relations between Kent and the Franks. \u00c6thelberht's marriage to Bertha certainly connected the two courts, although not as equals: the Franks would have thought of \u00c6thelberht as an under-king. There is no record that \u00c6thelberht ever accepted a continental king as his overlord and, as a result, historians are divided on the true nature of the relationship. Evidence for an explicit Frankish overlordship of Kent comes from a letter written by Pope Gregory the Great to Theuderic, king of Burgundy, and Theudebert, king of Austrasia. The letter concerned Augustine's mission to Kent in 597, and in it Gregory says that he believes \"that you wish your subjects in every respect to be converted to that faith in which you, their kings and lords, stand\". It may be that this is a papal compliment, rather than a description of the relationship between the kingdoms. It also has been suggested that Liudhard, Bertha's chaplain, was intended as a representative of the Frankish church in Kent, which also could be interpreted as evidence of overlordship.\nA possible reason for the willingness of the Franks to connect themselves with the Kentish court is the fact that a Frankish king, Chilperic I, is recorded as having conquered a people known as the Euthiones during the mid-sixth century. If, as seems likely from the name, these people were the continental remnants of the Jutish invaders of Kent, then it may be that the marriage was intended as a unifying political move, reconnecting different branches of the same people. Another perspective on the marriage may be gained by considering that it is likely that \u00c6thelberht was not yet king at the time he and Bertha were wed: it may be that Frankish support for him, acquired via the marriage, was instrumental in gaining the throne for him.\nRegardless of the political relationship between \u00c6thelberht and the Franks, there is abundant evidence of strong connections across the English Channel. There was a luxury trade between Kent and the Franks, and burial artefacts found include clothing, drink, and weapons that reflect Frankish cultural influence. The Kentish burials have a greater range of imported goods than those of the neighbouring Anglo-Saxon regions, which is not surprising given Kent's easier access to trade across the English Channel. In addition, the grave goods are both richer and more numerous in Kentish graves, implying that material wealth was derived from that trade. Frankish influences also may be detected in the social and agrarian organization of Kent. Other cultural influences may be seen in the burials as well, so it is not necessary to presume that there was direct settlement by the Franks in Kent.\nRise to dominance.\nBretwalda.\nIn his \"Ecclesiastical History\", Bede includes his list of seven kings who held \"imperium\" over the other kingdoms south of the Humber. The usual translation for \"imperium\" is \"overlordship\". Bede names \u00c6thelberht as the third on the list, after \u00c6lle of Sussex and Ceawlin of Wessex. The anonymous annalist who composed one of the versions of the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" repeated Bede's list of seven kings in a famous entry under the year 827, with one additional king, Egbert of Wessex. The \"Chronicle\" also records that these kings held the title \"bretwalda\", or \"Britain-ruler\". The exact meaning of \"bretwalda\" has been the subject of much debate; it has been described as a term \"of encomiastic poetry\", but there also is evidence that it implied a definite role of military leadership.\nThe prior \"bretwalda\", Ceawlin, is recorded by the \"Anglo-Saxon Chronicle\" as having fought \u00c6thelberht in 568. The entry states that \u00c6thelberht lost the battle and was driven back to Kent. The dating of the entries concerning the West Saxons in this section of the \"Chronicle\" is thought to be unreliable and a recent analysis suggests that Ceawlin's reign is more likely to have been approximately 581\u2013588, rather than the dates of 560\u2013592 that are given in the \"Chronicle\". The battle was at \"Wibbandun\", which may be translated as Wibba's Mount; it is not known where this was.\nAt some point Ceawlin ceased to hold the title of \"bretwalda\", perhaps after a battle at Stoke Lyne, in Oxfordshire, which the \"Chronicle\" dates to 584, some eight years before he was deposed in 592 (again using the \"Chronicle's\" unreliable dating). \u00c6thelberht certainly was a dominant ruler by 601, when Gregory the Great wrote to him: Gregory urges \u00c6thelberht to spread Christianity among those kings and peoples subject to him, implying some level of overlordship. If the battle of Wibbandun was fought c. 590, as has been suggested, then \u00c6thelberht must have gained his position as overlord at some time in the 590s. This dating for Wibbandun is slightly inconsistent with the proposed dates of 581\u2013588 for Ceawlin's reign, but those dates are not thought to be precise, merely the most plausible given the available data.\nRelationships with other kingdoms.\nIn addition to the evidence of the \"Chronicle\" that \u00c6thelberht was accorded the title of \"bretwalda\", there is evidence of his domination in several of the southern kingdoms of the Heptarchy. In Essex, \u00c6thelberht appears to have been in a position to exercise authority shortly after 604, when his intervention helped in the conversion of King S\u00e6berht of Essex, his nephew, to Christianity. It was \u00c6thelberht, and not S\u00e6berht, who built and endowed St. Pauls in London, where St Paul's Cathedral now stands. Further evidence is provided by Bede, who explicitly describes \u00c6thelberht as S\u00e6berht's overlord.\nBede describes \u00c6thelberht's relationship with R\u00e6dwald, king of East Anglia, in a passage that is not completely clear in meaning. It seems to imply that R\u00e6dwald retained \"ducatus\", or military command of his people, even while \u00c6thelberht held \"imperium\". This implies that being a \"bretwalda\" usually included holding the military command of other kingdoms and also that it was more than that, since \u00c6thelberht is \"bretwalda\" despite R\u00e6dwald's control of his own troops. R\u00e6dwald was converted to Christianity while in Kent but did not abandon his pagan beliefs; this, together with the fact that he retained military independence, implies that \u00c6thelberht's overlordship of East Anglia was much weaker than his influence with the East Saxons. An alternative interpretation, however, is that the passage in Bede should be translated as \"R\u00e6dwald, king of the East Angles, who while \u00c6thelberht lived, even conceded to him the military leadership of his people\"; if this is Bede's intent, then East Anglia firmly was under \u00c6thelberht's overlordship.\nThere is no evidence that \u00c6thelberht's influence in other kingdoms was enough for him to convert any other kings to Christianity, although this is partly due to the lack of sources\u2014nothing is known of Sussex's history, for example, for almost all of the seventh and eighth centuries. \u00c6thelberht was able to arrange a meeting in 602 in the Severn valley, on the northwestern borders of Wessex, however, and this may be an indication of the extent of his influence in the west. No evidence survives showing Kentish domination of Mercia, but it is known that Mercia was independent of Northumbria, so it is quite plausible that it was under Kentish overlordship.\nAugustine's mission and early Christianisation.\nThe native Britons had converted to Christianity under Roman rule. The Anglo-Saxon invasions separated the British church from European Christianity for centuries, so the church in Rome had no presence or authority in Britain, and in fact, Rome knew so little about the British church that it was unaware of any schism in customs. However, \u00c6thelberht would have known something about the Roman church from his Frankish wife, Bertha, who had brought a bishop, Liudhard, with her across the Channel, and for whom \u00c6thelberht built a chapel, St Martin's.\nIn 596, Pope Gregory the Great sent Augustine, prior of the monastery of St. Andrew in Rome, to England as a missionary, and in 597, a group of nearly forty monks, led by Augustine, landed on the Isle of Thanet in Kent. According to Bede, \u00c6thelberht was sufficiently distrustful of the newcomers to insist on meeting them under the open sky, to prevent them from performing sorcery. The monks impressed \u00c6thelberht, but he was not converted immediately. He agreed to allow the mission to settle in Canterbury and permitted them to preach.\nIt is not known when \u00c6thelberht became a Christian. It is possible, despite Bede's account, that he already was a Christian before Augustine's mission arrived. It is likely that Liudhard and Bertha pressed \u00c6thelberht to consider becoming a Christian before the arrival of the mission, and it is also likely that a condition of \u00c6thelberht's marriage to Bertha was that \u00c6thelberht would consider conversion. Conversion via the influence of the Frankish court would have been seen as an explicit recognition of Frankish overlordship, however, so it is possible that \u00c6thelberht's delay of his conversion until it could be accomplished via Roman influence might have been an assertion of independence from Frankish control. It also has been argued that Augustine's hesitation\u2014he turned back to Rome, asking to be released from the mission\u2014is an indication that \u00c6thelberht was a pagan at the time Augustine was sent.\nAt the latest, \u00c6thelberht must have converted before 601, since that year Gregory wrote to him as a Christian king. An old tradition records that \u00c6thelberht converted on 1 June, in the summer of the year that Augustine arrived. Through \u00c6thelberht's influence S\u00e6berht, king of Essex, also was converted, but there were limits to the effectiveness of the mission. The entire Kentish court did not convert: Eadbald, \u00c6thelberht's son and heir, was a pagan at his accession. R\u00e6dwald, king of East Anglia, was only partly converted (apparently while at \u00c6thelberht's court) and retained a pagan shrine next to the new Christian altar. Augustine also was unsuccessful in gaining the allegiance of the British clergy.\nLaw code.\nSome time after the arrival of Augustine's mission, perhaps in 602 or 603, \u00c6thelberht issued a set of laws, in ninety sections. These laws are by far the earliest surviving code composed in any of the Germanic countries, and they were almost certainly among the first documents written down in Anglo-Saxon, as literacy would have arrived in England with Augustine's mission. The only surviving early manuscript, the \"Textus Roffensis\", dates from the twelfth century, and it now resides in the Medway Studies Centre in Strood, Kent. \u00c6thelberht's code makes reference to the church in the very first item, which enumerates the compensation required for the property of a bishop, a deacon, a priest, and so on; but overall, the laws seem remarkably uninfluenced by Christian principles. Bede asserted that they were composed \"after the Roman manner\", but there is little discernible Roman influence either. In subject matter, the laws have been compared to the \"Lex Salica\" of the Franks, but it is not thought that \u00c6thelberht based his new code on any specific previous model.\nThe laws are concerned with setting and enforcing the penalties for transgressions at all levels of society; the severity of the fine depended on the social rank of the victim. The king had a financial interest in enforcement, for part of the fines would come to him in many cases, but the king also was responsible for law and order, and avoiding blood feuds by enforcing the rules on compensation for injury was part of the way the king maintained control. \u00c6thelberht's laws are mentioned by Alfred the Great, who compiled his own laws, making use of the prior codes created by \u00c6thelberht, as well as those of Offa of Mercia and Ine of Wessex.\nOne of \u00c6thelberht's laws seems to preserve a trace of a very old custom: the third item in the code states that \"If the king is drinking at a man's home, and anyone commits any evil deed there, he is to pay twofold compensation.\" This probably refers to the ancient custom of a king traveling the country, being hosted, and being provided for by his subjects wherever he went. The king's servants retained these rights for centuries after \u00c6thelberht's time.\nItems 77\u201381 in the code have been interpreted as a description of a woman's financial rights after a divorce or legal separation. These clauses define how much of the household goods a woman could keep in different circumstances, depending on whether she keeps custody of the children, for example. It has recently been suggested, however, that it would be more correct to interpret these clauses as referring to women who are widowed, rather than divorced.\nTrade and coinage.\nThere is little documentary evidence about the nature of trade in \u00c6thelberht's Kent. It is known that the kings of Kent had established royal control of trade by the late seventh century, but it is not known how early this control began. There is archaeological evidence suggesting that the royal influence predates any of the written sources. It has been suggested that one of \u00c6thelberht's achievements was to take control of trade away from the aristocracy and to make it a royal monopoly. The continental trade provided Kent access to luxury goods which gave it an advantage in trading with the other Anglo-Saxon nations, and the revenue from trade was important in itself.\nKentish manufacture before 600 included glass beakers and jewelry. Kentish jewellers were highly skilled, and before the end of the sixth century they gained access to gold. Goods from Kent are found in cemeteries across the channel and as far away as at the mouth of the Loire. It is not known what Kent traded for all of this wealth, although it seems likely that there was a flourishing slave trade. It may well be that this wealth was the foundation of \u00c6thelberht's strength, although his overlordship and the associated right to demand tribute would have brought wealth in its turn.\nIt may have been during \u00c6thelberht's reign that the first coins were minted in England since the departure of the Romans: none bear his name, but it is thought likely that the first coins predate the end of the sixth century. These early coins were gold, and probably were the shillings ( in Old English) that are mentioned in \u00c6thelberht's laws. The coins are also known to numismatists as \"thrymsas\".\nDeath and succession.\n\u00c6thelberht died on 24 February 616 and was succeeded by his son, Eadbald, who was not a Christian\u2014Bede says he had been converted but went back to his pagan faith, although he ultimately did become a Christian king. Eadbald outraged the church by marrying his stepmother, which was contrary to Church law, and by refusing to accept baptism. S\u00e6berht of the East Saxons also died at approximately this time, and he was succeeded by his three sons, none of whom were Christian. A subsequent revolt against Christianity and the expulsion of the missionaries from Kent may have been a reaction to Kentish overlordship after \u00c6thelberht's death as much as a pagan opposition to Christianity.\nIn addition to Eadbald, it is possible that \u00c6thelberht had another son, \u00c6thelwald. The evidence for this is a papal letter to Justus, archbishop of Canterbury from 619 to 625, that refers to a king named Aduluald, who is apparently different from Audubald, which refers to Eadbald. There is no agreement among modern scholars on how to interpret this: \"Aduluald\" might be intended as a representation of \"\u00c6thelwald\", and hence an indication of another king, perhaps a sub-king of west Kent; or it may be merely a scribal error which should be read as referring to Eadbald.\nLiturgical celebration.\n\u00c6thelberht was later regarded as a saint for his role in establishing Christianity among the Anglo-Saxons. His feast day was originally 24 February but was changed to 25 February. In the 2004 edition of the Roman Martyrology, he is listed under his date of death, 24 February, with the citation: 'King of Kent, converted by St Augustine, bishop, the first leader of the English people to do so'. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Southwark, which contains Kent, commemorates him on 25 February. He is honoured together with his wife Bertha on the liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (United States) on 27 May.\nHe is also venerated in the Eastern Orthodox Church as Saint Ethelbert, king of Kent, his day commemorated on 25 February.\nNotes and references.\nBibliography.\nPrimary sources\nSecondary sources"}

In his book \"What Is Life?\" Schr\u00f6dinger addressed the problems of genetics, looking at the phenomenon of life from the point of view of physics. He paid great attention to the philosophical aspects of science, ancient and oriental philosophical concepts, ethics, and religion. He also wrote on philosophy and theoretical biology. He is also known for his \"Schr\u00f6dinger's cat\" thought experiment.\nBiography.\nEarly years.\nSchr\u00f6dinger was born in , Vienna, Austria, on 12 August 1887, to ( producer, botanist) and Georgine Emilia Brenda Schr\u00f6dinger (n\u00e9e Bauer) (daughter of , professor of chemistry, TU Wien). He was their only child.\nHis mother was of half Austrian and half English descent; his father was Catholic and his mother was Lutheran. Although he was raised in a religious household as a Lutheran, he himself was an atheist. However, he had strong interests in Eastern religions and pantheism, and he used religious symbolism in his works. He also believed his scientific work was an approach to Divinity, albeit in an intellectual sense.\nHe was also able to learn English outside school, as his maternal grandmother was British. Between 1906 and 1910 (the year he earned his doctorate) Schr\u00f6dinger studied at the University of Vienna under the physicists Franz S. Exner (1849\u20131926) and Friedrich Hasen\u00f6hrl (1874\u20131915). He received his doctorate at Vienna under Hasen\u00f6hrl. He also conducted experimental work with Karl Wilhelm Friedrich \"Fritz\" Kohlrausch.\nIn 1911, Schr\u00f6dinger became an assistant to Exner. At an early age, Schr\u00f6dinger was strongly influenced by Arthur Schopenhauer. As a result of his extensive reading of Schopenhauer's works, he became deeply interested throughout his life in colour theory and philosophy. In his lecture \"Mind and Matter\", he said that \"The world extended in space and time is but our representation.\" This is a repetition of the first words of Schopenhauer's main work. Schopenaur's works introduced him into the Indian philosophy, more specifically to the upanishad and advaita vedanta's interpretetion. He once took on a peculiar line of thought. If the world is indeed created by our act of observation, there should be billions of such worlds, one for each of us. How come your world and my world are the same? If something happens in my world, does it happen in your world, too? What causes all these worlds to synchronise with each other? \nHe found his answer, again just like others, in the Upanishads.\u201cThere is obviously only one alternative, namely the unification of minds or consciousnesses. Their multiplicity is only apparent, in truth there is only one mind. This is the doctrine of the Upanishads.\u201d\nMiddle years.\nIn 1914 Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger achieved habilitation (\"venia legendi\"). Between 1914 and 1918 he participated in war work as a commissioned officer in the Austrian fortress artillery (Gorizia, Duino, Sistiana, Prosecco, Vienna). In 1920 he became the assistant to Max Wien, in Jena, and in September 1920 he attained the position of ao. Prof. (\"ausserordentlicher Professor\"), roughly equivalent to Reader (UK) or associate professor (US), in Stuttgart. In 1921, he became o. Prof. (\"ordentlicher Professor\", i.e. full professor), in Breslau (now Wroc\u0142aw, Poland).\nIn 1921, he moved to the University of Z\u00fcrich. In 1927, he succeeded Max Planck at the Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin. In 1933, Schr\u00f6dinger decided to leave Germany because he disliked the Nazis' antisemitism. He became a Fellow of Magdalen College at the University of Oxford. Soon after he arrived, he received the Nobel Prize together with Paul Dirac. His position at Oxford did not work out well; his unconventional domestic arrangements, sharing living quarters with two women, were not met with acceptance. In 1934, Schr\u00f6dinger lectured at Princeton University; he was offered a permanent position there, but did not accept it. Again, his wish to set up house with his wife and his mistress may have created a problem. He had the prospect of a position at the University of Edinburgh but visa delays occurred, and in the end he took up a position at the University of Graz in Austria in 1936. He had also accepted the offer of chair position at Department of Physics, Allahabad University in India.\nIn the midst of these tenure issues in 1935, after extensive correspondence with Albert Einstein, he proposed what is now called the Schr\u00f6dinger's cat thought experiment.\nLater years.\nIn 1938, after the Anschluss, Schr\u00f6dinger had problems in Graz because of his flight from Germany in 1933 and his known opposition to Nazism. He issued a statement recanting this opposition (he later regretted doing so and explained the reason to Einstein). However, this did not fully appease the new dispensation and the University of Graz dismissed him from his post for political unreliability. He suffered harassment and was instructed not to leave the country. He and his wife, however, fled to Italy. From there, he went to visiting positions in Oxford and Ghent University.\nIn the same year he received a personal invitation from Ireland's Taoiseach, \u00c9amon de Valera \u2013 a mathematician himself \u2013 to reside in Ireland and agree to help establish an Institute for Advanced Studies in Dublin. He moved to Kincora Road, Clontarf, Dublin and lived modestly. A plaque was erected at his Clontarf residence and at the address of his workplace in Merrion Square. He became the Director of the School for Theoretical Physics in 1940 and remained there for 17 years. He became a naturalized Irish citizen in 1948, but also retained his Austrian citizenship. He wrote around 50 further publications on various topics, including his explorations of unified field theory.\nIn 1944, he wrote \"What Is Life?\", which contains a discussion of negentropy and the concept of a complex molecule with the genetic code for living organisms. According to James D. Watson's memoir, \"DNA, the Secret of Life\", Schr\u00f6dinger's book gave Watson the inspiration to research the gene, which led to the discovery of the DNA double helix structure in 1953. Similarly, Francis Crick, in his autobiographical book \"What Mad Pursuit\", described how he was influenced by Schr\u00f6dinger's speculations about how genetic information might be stored in molecules.\nSchr\u00f6dinger stayed in Dublin until retiring in 1955. He had a lifelong interest in the Vedanta philosophy of Hinduism, which influenced his speculations at the close of \"What Is Life?\" about the possibility that individual consciousness is only a manifestation of a unitary consciousness pervading the universe. Schr\u00f6dinger expressed sympathy for the idea of tat tvam asi, stating \"you can throw yourself flat on the ground, stretched out upon Mother Earth, with the certain conviction that you are one with her and she with you\".\nA manuscript \"Fragment from an unpublished dialogue of Galileo\" from this time recently resurfaced at The King's Hospital boarding school, Dublin after it was written for the School's 1955 edition of their Blue Coat to celebrate his leaving of Dublin to take up his appointment as Chair of Physics at the University of Vienna.\nIn 1956, he returned to Vienna (chair \"ad personam\"). At an important lecture during the World Energy Conference he refused to speak on nuclear energy because of his scepticism about it and gave a philosophical lecture instead. During this period Schr\u00f6dinger turned from mainstream quantum mechanics' definition of wave\u2013particle duality and promoted the wave idea alone, causing much controversy.\nPersonal life.\nOn 6 April 1920, Schr\u00f6dinger married Annemarie (Anny) Bertel. Schr\u00f6dinger suffered from tuberculosis and several times in the 1920s stayed at a sanatorium in Arosa. It was there that he formulated his wave equation. As has been noted above, Schr\u00f6dinger had an unconventional personal life. When he migrated to Ireland in 1938, he obtained visas for himself, his wife and also another woman, Mrs. Hilde March. March was the wife of an Austrian colleague and Schr\u00f6dinger had fathered a daughter with her in 1934. Schr\u00f6dinger wrote personally to the Taoiseach, \u00c9amon de Valera, to obtain the visa for Mrs. March. In October 1939 the \"m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois\" duly took up residence in Dublin. Schr\u00f6dinger fathered two further daughters by two different women during his time in Ireland. \nOn 4 January 1961, Schr\u00f6dinger died of tuberculosis, aged 73, in Vienna. He left Anny a widow, and was buried in Alpbach, Austria, in a Catholic cemetery. Although he was not Catholic, the priest in charge of the cemetery permitted the burial after learning Schr\u00f6dinger was a member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences. His wife, Anny (born 3 December 1896) died on 3 October 1965. Schr\u00f6dinger's grandson, Professor Terry Rudolph, has followed in his footsteps as a quantum physicist, and teaches at Imperial College London.\nInterest in philosophy.\nSchr\u00f6dinger had a deep interest in philosophy, and was influenced by the works of Arthur Schopenhauer and Baruch Spinoza. He discussed topics such as consciousness, the mind-body problem, sense perception, free will and objective reality in his lectures and writings.\nScientific activities.\nEarly in his life, Schr\u00f6dinger experimented in the fields of electrical engineering, atmospheric electricity, and atmospheric radioactivity, but he usually worked with his former teacher Franz Exner. He also studied vibrational theory, the theory of Brownian movement, and mathematical statistics. In 1912, at the request of the editors of the \"Handbook of Electricity and Magnetism\", Schr\u00f6dinger wrote an article titled \"Dieelectrism\". That same year, Schr\u00f6dinger gave a theoretical estimate of the probable height distribution of radioactive substances, which is required to explain the observed radioactivity of the atmosphere, and in August 1913 executed several experiments in Zeehame that confirmed his theoretical estimate and those of Victor Franz Hess. For this work, Schr\u00f6dinger was awarded the 1920 Haitinger Prize (Haitinger-Preis) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences. Other experimental studies conducted by the young researcher in 1914 were checking formulas for capillary pressure in gas bubbles and the study of the properties of soft beta-radiation appearing in the fall of gamma rays on the surface of metal. The last work he performed together with his friend Fritz Kohlrausch. In 1919, Schr\u00f6dinger performed his last physical experiment on coherent light and subsequently focused on theoretical studies.\nQuantum mechanics.\nNew quantum theory.\nIn the first years of his career Schr\u00f6dinger became acquainted with the ideas of quantum theory, developed in the works of Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, Arnold Sommerfeld, and others. This knowledge helped him work on some problems in theoretical physics, but the Austrian scientist at the time was not yet ready to part with the traditional methods of classical physics.\nThe first publications of Schr\u00f6dinger about atomic theory and the theory of spectra began to emerge only from the beginning of the 1920s, after his personal acquaintance with Sommerfeld and Wolfgang Pauli and his move to Germany. In January 1921, Schr\u00f6dinger finished his first article on this subject, about the framework of the Bohr-Sommerfeld effect of the interaction of electrons on some features of the spectra of the alkali metals. Of particular interest to him was the introduction of relativistic considerations in quantum theory. In autumn 1922 he analyzed the electron orbits in an atom from a geometric point of view, using methods developed by the mathematician Hermann Weyl (1885\u20131955). This work, in which it was shown that quantum orbits are associated with certain geometric properties, was an important step in predicting some of the features of wave mechanics. Earlier in the same year he created the Schr\u00f6dinger equation of the relativistic Doppler effect for spectral lines, based on the hypothesis of light quanta and considerations of energy and momentum. He liked the idea of his teacher Exner on the statistical nature of the conservation laws, so he enthusiastically embraced the articles of Bohr, Kramers, and Slater, which suggested the possibility of violation of these laws in individual atomic processes (for example, in the process of emission of radiation). Although the experiments of Hans Geiger and Walther Bothe soon cast doubt on this, the idea of energy as a statistical concept was a lifelong attraction for Schr\u00f6dinger and he discussed it in some reports and publications.\nCreation of wave mechanics.\nIn January 1926, Schr\u00f6dinger published in \"Annalen der Physik\" the paper \"\" (Quantization as an Eigenvalue Problem) on wave mechanics and presented what is now known as the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. In this paper, he gave a \"derivation\" of the wave equation for time-independent systems and showed that it gave the correct energy eigenvalues for a hydrogen-like atom. This paper has been universally celebrated as one of the most important achievements of the twentieth century and created a revolution in most areas of quantum mechanics and indeed of all physics and chemistry. A second paper was submitted just four weeks later that solved the quantum harmonic oscillator, rigid rotor, and diatomic molecule problems and gave a new derivation of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. A third paper, published in May, showed the equivalence of his approach to that of Heisenberg and gave the treatment of the Stark effect. A fourth paper in this series showed how to treat problems in which the system changes with time, as in scattering problems. In this paper he introduced a complex solution to the wave equation in order to prevent the occurrence of fourth and sixth order differential equations. (This was arguably the moment when quantum mechanics switched from real to complex numbers.) When he introduced complex numbers in order to lower the order of the differential equations, something magical happened, and all of wave mechanics was at his feet. (He eventually reduced the order to one.) These papers were his central achievement and were at once recognized as having great significance by the physics community.\nSchr\u00f6dinger was not entirely comfortable with the implications of quantum theory. He wrote about the probability interpretation of quantum mechanics, saying: \"I don't like it, and I'm sorry I ever had anything to do with it.\" (Just in order to ridicule the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics he contrived the famous thought-experiment called Schr\u00f6dinger's cat paradox.)\nWork on a unified field theory.\nFollowing his work on quantum mechanics, Schr\u00f6dinger devoted considerable effort to working on a unified field theory that would unite gravity, electromagnetism, and nuclear forces within the basic framework of General Relativity, doing the work with an extended correspondence with Albert Einstein. In 1947, he announced a result, \"Affine Field Theory,\" in a talk at the Royal Irish Academy, but the announcement was criticized by Einstein as \"preliminary\" and failed to lead to the desired unified theory. Following the failure of his attempt at unification, Schr\u00f6dinger gave up his work on unification and turned to other topics.\nColour.\nSchr\u00f6dinger had a strong interest in psychology, in particular colour perception and colorimetry (German: \"\"). He spent quite a few years of his life working on these questions and published a series of papers in this area:\nHis work on the psychology of colour perception follows the step of Newton, Maxwell and von Helmholtz in the same area. Some of these papers have been translated into English and can be found in: \"Sources of Colour Science\", Ed. David L. MacAdam, MIT Press (1970) and in \"Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Color Theory, Translated with Modern Commentary\", Ed. Keith K. Niall, Springer (2017). .\nLegacy.\nThe philosophical issues raised by Schr\u00f6dinger's cat are still debated today and remain his most enduring legacy in popular science, while Schr\u00f6dinger's equation is his most enduring legacy at a more technical level. Schr\u00f6dinger is one of several individuals who have been called \"the father of quantum mechanics\". The large crater Schr\u00f6dinger, on the far side of the Moon, is named after him. The Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger International Institute for Mathematical Physics was established in Vienna in 1993.\nSchr\u00f6dinger's portrait was the main feature of the design of the 1983\u201397 Austrian 1000-schilling banknote, the second-highest denomination.\nA building is named after him at the University of Limerick, in Limerick, Ireland, as is the 'Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger Zentrum' at Adlershof in Berlin.\nSchr\u00f6dinger's 126th birthday anniversary in 2013 was celebrated with a Google Doodle.\nHonors and awards.\nSchr\u00f6dinger's cat is named in his honour, see also: List of things named after Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger."}

Draper developed EasyWriter while serving nights in the Alameda County Jail under a work furlough program.\nIt was later ported to the IBM PC and released with the new computer in August 1981 as a launch title. Many criticized EasyWriter 1.0, distributed by IBM, for being buggy and hard to use; \"PC Magazine\" told the company as early as December 1981 that subscribers \"wish IBM had provided better word processing\". The company quickly persuaded IUS to develop a new version. (When founder William Baker later sent \"I Survived EasyWriter\" T-shirts, IBM returned them stating that it did not accept gifts.) IBM offered a free upgrade to version 1.10 to version 1.0 owners, but EasyWriter's poor quality had caused others to quickly provide alternatives, such as Camilo Wilson's Volkswriter.\nIUS released a separate application, EasyWriter II. Completely rewritten by Basic Software Group, IUS emphasized that II\u2014developed with C instead of Forth\u2014\"is not an updated version of the original IBM selection or its upgrade\".\nReception.\n\"BYTE\" in 1981 reviewed EasyWriter and EasyWriter Professional for the Apple II, stating that \"editing is a pleasure with either version\", and approving of their features, user interface, and documentation. In an early review of the IBM PC, however, the magazine in 1982 stated that EasyWriter for it or the Apple II \"didn't seem to be of the same caliber as, say, VisiCalc or the Peachtree business packages\", citing the lack of ease of use and slow scrolling as flaws, and advised those who planned to use the IBM PC primarily for word processing to buy another computer until alternative software became available. Andrew Fluegelman wrote in \"PC Magazine\" that although EasyWriter 1.0 appeared to be an easy-to-use word processor for casual users, it \"contains a few very annoying inconveniences and some very serious traps\". He cited several bugs, slow performance, and user-interface issues, and later called it \"pretty much a lemon\".\nIBM's Don Estridge admitted in 1983 that he \"tried to use EasyWriter 1.0 and had the same experience everybody else had\". EasyWriter 1.10 resolved most of Fluegelman's complaints. He reported that it \"performs smoothly, will handle most any routine writing and printing job, and is easy to learn and operate\", and that if IBM had released 1.10 first EasyWriter would likely have become the standard PC word processor.\n\"BYTE\" criticized EasyWriter II for running as a booter instead of using DOS, requiring specially formatted disks for storage and a utility to convert to DOS-formatted disks, not being compatible with double-sided drives, and using a heavily modal editing interface."}
{"id": "9946", "revid": "1023240842", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9946", "title": "Ed Sullivan", "text": "Edward Vincent Sullivan (September 28, 1901 \u2013 October 13, 1974) was an American television personality, impresario, sports and entertainment reporter, and syndicated columnist for the \"New York Daily News\" and the Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate. He is principally remembered as the creator and host of the television variety program \"The Toast of the Town\", later popularly\u2014and, in 1955, officially\u2014renamed \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". Broadcast for 23 years from 1948 to 1971, it set a record as the longest-running variety show in US broadcast history. \"It was, by almost any measure, the last great TV show,\" said television critic David Hinckley. \"It's one of our fondest, dearest pop culture memories.\"\nSullivan was a broadcasting pioneer at many levels during television's infancy. As TV critic David Bianculli wrote, \"Before MTV, Sullivan presented rock acts. Before Bravo, he presented jazz and classical music and theater. Before the Comedy Channel, even before there was \"the Tonight Show\", Sullivan discovered, anointed and popularized young comedians. Before there were 500 channels, before there was cable, Ed Sullivan was where the choice was. From the start, he was indeed 'the Toast of the Town'.\" In 1996, Sullivan was ranked number 50 on \"TV Guide\"'s \"50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time\".\nEarly life and career.\nEdward Vincent Sullivan was born on September 28, 1901 in Harlem, New York City, the son of Elizabeth F. (n\u00e9e Smith) and Peter Arthur Sullivan, a customs house employee. He grew up in Port Chester, New York where the family lived in a small red brick home at 53 Washington Street. He was of Irish descent. The entire family loved music, and someone was always playing the piano or singing. A phonograph was a prized possession; the family loved playing all types of records on it. Sullivan was a gifted athlete in high school, earning 12 athletic letters at Port Chester High School. He played halfback in football; he was a guard in basketball; in track he was a sprinter. With the baseball team, Sullivan was catcher and team captain, and he led the team to several championships. Baseball made an impression on him that would affect his career as well as the culture of America. Sullivan noted that in the state of New York, integration was taken for granted in high school sports: \"When we went up into Connecticut, we ran into clubs that had Negro players. In those days this was accepted as commonplace; and so, my instinctive antagonism years later to any theory that a Negro wasn't a worthy opponent or was an inferior person. It was just as simple as that.\"\nSullivan landed his first job at \"The Port Chester Daily Item\", a local newspaper for which he had written sports news while in high school and then joined the paper full-time after graduation. In 1919, he joined \"The Hartford Post\". The newspaper folded in his first week there, but he landed another job on \"The New York Evening Mail\" as a sports reporter. After \"The Evening Mail\" closed in 1923, he bounced through a series of news jobs with The Associated Press, \"The Philadelphia Bulletin\", \"The Morning World\", \"The Morning Telegraph\", \"The New York Bulletin\" and \"The Leader\". Finally, in 1927, Sullivan joined \"The Evening Graphic\", first as a sports writer, and then as a sports editor. In 1929, when Walter Winchell moved to \"The Daily Mirror\", Sullivan was made Broadway columnist. He left the \"Graphic\" for the city's largest tabloid, the \"New York Daily News\". His column, \"Little Old New York\", concentrated on Broadway shows and gossip, as Winchell's had; and, like Winchell, he did show-business news broadcasts on radio. Again echoing Winchell, Sullivan took on yet another medium in 1933 by writing and starring in the film \"Mr. Broadway\", which has him guiding the audience around New York nightspots to meet entertainers and celebrities. Sullivan soon became a powerful starmaker in the entertainment world himself, becoming one of Winchell's main rivals, setting the El Morocco nightclub in New York as his unofficial headquarters against Winchell's seat of power at the nearby Stork Club. Sullivan continued writing for \"The News\" throughout his broadcasting career, and his popularity long outlived Winchell's. In the late 60's, however, Sullivan praised Winchell's legacy in a magazine interview, leading to a major reconciliation between the longtime adversaries.\nThroughout his career as a columnist, Sullivan had dabbled in entertainment\u2014producing vaudeville shows with which he appeared as master of ceremonies in the 1920s and 1930s, directing a radio program over the original WABC (now WCBS) and organizing benefit reviews for various causes.\nRadio.\nIn 1941, Sullivan was host of the \"Summer Silver Theater\", a variety program on CBS, with Will Bradley as bandleader and a guest star featured each week.\nTelevision.\nIn 1948, Marlo Lewis, a producer, got the CBS network to hire Sullivan to do a weekly Sunday-night TV variety show, \"Toast of the Town\", which later became \"The Ed Sullivan Show\". Debuting in June 1948, the show was originally broadcast from the Maxine Elliott Theatre on West 39th Street in New York City. In January 1953, it moved to CBS-TV Studio 50, at 1697 Broadway (at 53rd Street) in New York City, which in 1967 was renamed the Ed Sullivan Theater (and was later the home of the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" and \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\"). Studio 50 was formerly a CBS Radio studio, from 1936 to 1953, and before that was the legitimate Hammerstein Theatre, built in 1927.\nTelevision critics gave the new show and its host poor reviews. Harriet Van Horne alleged that \"he got where he is not by having a personality, but by having \"no\" personality.\" (The host wrote to the critic, \"Dear Miss Van Horne: You bitch. Sincerely, Ed Sullivan.\") Sullivan had little acting ability; in 1967, 20 years after his show's debut, \"Time\" magazine asked, \"What exactly is Ed Sullivan's talent?\" His mannerisms on camera were so awkward that some viewers believed the host suffered from Bell's palsy. \"Time\" in 1955 stated that Sullivan resembled\nThe magazine concluded, however, that \"Yet, instead of frightening children, Ed Sullivan charms the whole family.\" Sullivan appeared to the audience as an average guy who brought the great acts of show business to their home televisions. \"Ed Sullivan will last\", comedian Fred Allen said, \"as long as someone else has talent\", and frequent guest Alan King said, \"Ed does nothing, but he does it better than anyone else in television.\" He had a newspaperman's instinct for what the public wanted, and programmed his variety hours with remarkable balance. There was something for everyone. A typical show would feature a vaudeville act (acrobats, jugglers, magicians, etc.), one or two popular comedians, a singing star, a hot jukebox favorite, a figure from the legitimate theater, and for the kids, a visit with puppet \"Topo Gigio, the little Italian mouse\", or a popular athlete. The bill was often international in scope, with many European performers augmenting the American artists.\nSullivan had a healthy sense of humor about himself and permitted\u2014even encouraged\u2014impersonators such as John Byner, Frank Gorshin, Rich Little, and especially Will Jordan to imitate him on his show. Johnny Carson also did a fair impression, and even Joan Rivers imitated Sullivan's unique posture. The impressionists exaggerated his stiffness, raised shoulders, and nasal tenor phrasing, along with some of his commonly used introductions, such as \"And now, right here on our stage...\", \"For all you youngsters out there...\", and \"a really big shew\" (his pronunciation of the word \"show\"). The latter phrase was in fact in the exclusive domain of his impressionists, as Sullivan never actually spoke the phrase \"really big show\" in the opening introduction of any episode in the entire history of the series. Will Jordan portrayed Sullivan in the films \"I Wanna Hold Your Hand\", \"The Buddy Holly Story\", \"The Doors\", \"Mr. Saturday Night\", \"Down with Love\", and in the 1979 TV movie \"Elvis\".\nSullivan inspired a song in the musical \"Bye Bye Birdie\", and in 1963, appeared as himself in the film.\nIn 1954, Sullivan was a co-host on a memorable TV musical special, \"\".\nSullivan, the starmaker.\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, Sullivan was a respected starmaker because of the number of performers who became household names after appearing on the show. He had a knack for identifying and promoting top talent and paid a great deal of money to secure that talent for his show. Sullivan was quoted as saying \"In the conduct of my own show, I've never asked a performer his religion, his race or his politics. Performers are engaged on the basis of their abilities. I believe that this is another quality of our show that has helped win it a wide and loyal audience.\"\nAlthough Sullivan was wary of Elvis Presley's \"bad boy\" image, and initially said that he would never book him, Presley became too big a name to ignore; in 1956, Sullivan signed him for three appearances. In August 1956, Sullivan was injured in an automobile accident near his country home in Southbury, Connecticut, and missed Presley's first appearance on September 9. Charles Laughton wound up introducing Presley on the Sullivan hour. When Ed returned to the show, audiences noticed a change in his voice. After Sullivan got to know Presley personally, he made amends by telling his audience, \"This is a real decent, fine boy.\"\nSullivan's failure to scoop the TV industry with Presley made him determined to get the next big sensation first. In November 1963, while in Heathrow Airport, Sullivan witnessed Beatlemania as the band returned from Sweden. At first he was reluctant to book the Beatles because the band did not have a commercially successful single released in the US at the time, but at the behest of a friend, legendary impresario Sid Bernstein, Sullivan signed the group. Their initial Sullivan show appearance on February 9, 1964, was the most-watched program in TV history to that point, and remains one of the most-watched programs of all time. The Beatles appeared three more times in person, and submitted filmed performances afterwards. The Dave Clark Five, who claimed a \"cleaner\" image than the Beatles, made 13 appearances on the show, more than any other UK group.\nUnlike many shows of the time, Sullivan asked that most musical acts perform their music live, rather than lip-synching to their recordings. Examination of performances shows that exceptions were made, as when a microphone could not be placed close enough to a performer for technical reasons. An example was B.J. Thomas' 1969 performance of \"Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head\", in which actual water was sprinkled on him as a special effect. In 1969, Sullivan presented the Jackson 5 with their first single \"I Want You Back\", which ousted the B.J. Thomas song from the top spot of \"Billboard's\" pop charts.\nSullivan had an appreciation for African American talent. According to biographer Gerald Nachman, \"Most TV variety shows welcomed 'acceptable' black superstars like Louis Armstrong, Pearl Bailey and Sammy Davis Jr. ... but in the early 1950s, long before it was fashionable, Sullivan was presenting the much more obscure black entertainers he had enjoyed in Harlem on his uptown rounds\u2014 legends like Peg Leg Bates, Pigmeat Markham and Tim Moore ... strangers to white America.\" He hosted pioneering TV appearances by Bo Diddley, the Platters, Brook Benton, Jackie Wilson, Fats Domino, and numerous Motown acts, including the Supremes, who appeared 17 times. As the critic John Leonard wrote, \"There wasn't an important black artist who didn't appear on Ed's show.\"\nHe defied pressure to exclude African American entertainers, and to avoid interacting with them when they did appear. \"Sullivan had to fend off his hard-won sponsor, Ford's Lincoln dealers, after kissing Pearl Bailey on the cheek and daring to shake Nat King Cole's hand,\" Nachman wrote. According to biographer Jerry Bowles, \"Sullivan once had a Ford executive thrown out of the theatre when he suggested that Sullivan stop booking so many black acts. And a dealer in Cleveland told him 'We realize that you got to have niggers on your show. But do you have to put your arm around Bill 'Bojangles' Robinson at the end of his dance?' Sullivan had to be physically restrained from beating the man to a pulp.\" Sullivan later raised money to help pay for Robinson's funeral. \"As a Catholic, it was inevitable that I would despise intolerance, because Catholics suffered more than their share of it,\" he told an interviewer. \"As I grew up, the causes of minorities were part and parcel of me. Negroes and Jews were the minority causes closest at hand. I need no urging to take a plunge in and help.\"\nAt a time when television had not yet embraced Country and Western music, Sullivan featured Nashville performers on his program. This, in turn, paved the way for shows such as \"Hee Haw\", and variety shows hosted by Johnny Cash, Glen Campbell, and other country singers. The Canadian comedy duo Wayne &amp; Shuster made 67 appearances between 1958 and 1969, the most of any act throughout the show's run.\nSullivan appeared as himself on other television programs, including an April 1958 episode of the Howard Duff and Ida Lupino CBS sitcom, \"Mr. Adams and Eve\". On September 14, 1958, Sullivan appeared on \"What's My Line?\" as a mystery guest, and showed his comedic side by donning a rubber mask. In 1961, Sullivan was asked by CBS to fill in for an ailing Red Skelton on \"The Red Skelton Show\". Sullivan took Skelton's roles in the various comedy sketches; Skelton's hobo character \"Freddie the Freeloader\" was renamed \"Eddie the Freeloader.\"\nPersonality.\nSullivan was quick to take offense if he felt that he had been crossed, and he could hold a grudge for a long time. As he told biographer Gerald Nachman, \"I'm a pop-off. I flare up, then I go around apologizing.\" \"Armed with an Irish temper and thin skin,\" wrote Nachman, \"Ed brought to his feuds a hunger for combat fed by his coverage of, and devotion to, boxing.\" Bo Diddley, Buddy Holly, Jackie Mason, and Jim Morrison were parties to some of Sullivan's most storied conflicts.\nFor his second Sullivan appearance in 1955, Bo Diddley planned to sing his namesake hit, \"Bo Diddley\", but Sullivan told him to perform Tennessee Ernie Ford's song \"Sixteen Tons\". \"That would have been the end of my career right there,\" Diddley told his biographer, so he sang \"Bo Diddley\" anyway. Sullivan was enraged: \"You're the first black boy that ever double-crossed me on the show,\" Diddley quoted him as saying. \"We didn't have much to do with each other after that.\" Later, Diddley resented that Elvis Presley, whom he accused of copying his revolutionary style and beat, received the attention and accolades on Sullivan's show that he felt were rightfully his. \"I am owed,\" he said, \"and I never got paid.\" \"He might have,\" wrote Nachman, \"had things gone smoother with Sullivan.\"\nBuddy Holly and the Crickets first appeared on the Sullivan show in 1957 to an enthusiastic response. For their second appearance in January 1958, Sullivan considered the lyrics of their chosen number \"Oh, Boy!\" too suggestive, and ordered Holly to substitute another song. Holly responded that he had already told his hometown friends in Texas that he would be singing \"Oh, Boy!\" for them. Sullivan, unaccustomed to having his instructions questioned, angrily repeated them, but Holly refused to back down. Later, when the band was slow to respond to a summons to the rehearsal stage, Sullivan commented, \"I guess the Crickets are not too excited to be on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\".\" Holly, still annoyed by Sullivan's attitude, replied, \"I hope they're damn more excited than I am.\" Sullivan retaliated by cutting them from two numbers to one, then mispronounced Holly's name during the introduction. He also saw to it that Holly's guitar amplifier volume was barely audible, except during his guitar solo. Nevertheless, the band was received so well that Sullivan was forced to invite them back; Holly responded that Sullivan did not have enough money. Archival photographs taken during the appearance show Holly smirking and ignoring a visibly angry Sullivan.\nDuring Jackie Mason's October 1964 performance on a show that had been shortened by ten minutes due to an address by President Lyndon Johnson, Sullivan\u2014on-stage but off-camera\u2014signaled Mason that he had two minutes left by holding up two fingers. Sullivan's signal distracted the studio audience, and to television viewers unaware of the circumstances, it seemed as though Mason's jokes were falling flat. Mason, in a bid to regain the audience's attention, cried, \"I'm getting fingers here!\" and made his own frantic hand gesture: \"Here's a finger for you!\" Videotapes of the incident are inconclusive as to whether Mason's upswept hand (which was just off-camera) was intended to be an indecent gesture, but Sullivan was convinced that it was, and banned Mason from future appearances on the program. Mason later insisted that he did not know what the \"middle finger\" meant, and that he did not make the gesture anyway. In September 1965, Sullivan\u2014who, according to Mason, was \"deeply apologetic\"\u2014brought Mason on the show for a \"surprise grand reunion\". \"He said they were old pals,\" Nachman wrote, \"news to Mason, who never got a repeat invitation.\" Mason added that his earning power \"...was cut right in half after that. I never really worked my way back until I opened on Broadway in 1986.\"\nWhen the Byrds performed on December 12, 1965, David Crosby got into a shouting match with the show's director. They were never asked to return.\nSullivan decided that \"Girl, we couldn't get much higher\", from the Doors' signature song \"Light My Fire\", was too overt a reference to drug use, and directed that the lyric be changed to \"Girl, we couldn't get much better\" for the group's September 1967 appearance. The band members \"nodded their assent\", according to Doors biographer Ben Fong-Torres, then sang the song as written. After the broadcast, producer Bob Precht told the group, \"Mr. Sullivan wanted you for six more shows, but you'll never work \"the Ed Sullivan Show\" again.\" Jim Morrison replied, \"Hey, man, we just \"did\" the \"Ed Sullivan Show\".\" \nThe Rolling Stones famously capitulated during their fifth appearance on the show, in 1967, when Mick Jagger was told to change the titular lyric of \"Let's Spend the Night Together\" to \"Let's spend some time together\". \"But Jagger prevailed,\" wrote Nachman, by deliberately calling attention to the censorship, rolling his eyes, mugging, and drawing out the word \"t-i-i-i-me\" as he sang the revised lyric. Sullivan was angered by the insubordination, but the Stones did make one additional appearance on the show, in 1969.\nMoe Howard of the Three Stooges recalled in 1975 that Sullivan had a memory problem of sorts: \"Ed was a very nice man, but for a showman, quite forgetful. On our first appearance, he introduced us as the Three Ritz Brothers. He got out of it by adding, 'who look more like the Three Stooges to me'.\" Joe DeRita, who worked with the Stooges after 1959, had commented that Sullivan had a personality \"like the bottom of a bird cage.\"\nDiana Ross, who was very fond of Sullivan, later recalled Sullivan's forgetfulness during the many occasions the Supremes performed on his show. In a 1995 appearance on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" (taped in the Ed Sullivan Theater), Ross stated, \"he could never remember our names. He called us 'the girls'.\"\nIn a 1990 press conference, Paul McCartney recalled meeting Sullivan again in the early 1970s. Sullivan apparently had no idea who McCartney was. McCartney tried to remind Sullivan that he was one of the Beatles, but Sullivan obviously could not remember, and nodding and smiling, simply shook McCartney's hand and left. In an interview with Howard Stern around 2012, Joan Rivers said that Sullivan had been suffering from dementia toward the end of his life.\nPolitics.\nSullivan, like many American entertainers, was pulled into the Cold War anticommunism of the late 1940s and 1950s. Tap dancer Paul Draper's scheduled January 1950 appearance on \"Toast of the Town\" met with opposition from Hester McCullough, an activist in the hunt for \"subversives\". Branding Draper a Communist Party \"sympathizer\", she demanded that Sullivan's lead sponsor, the Ford Motor Company, cancel Draper's appearance. Draper denied the charge, and appeared on the show as scheduled. Ford received over a thousand angry letters and telegrams, and Sullivan was obliged to promise Ford's advertising agency, Kenyon &amp; Eckhardt, that he would avoid controversial guests going forward. Draper was forced to move to Europe to earn a living.\nAfter the Draper incident, Sullivan began to work closely with Theodore Kirkpatrick of the anticommunist \"Counterattack\" newsletter. He would consult Kirkpatrick if any questions came up regarding a potential guest's political leanings. Sullivan wrote in his June 21, 1950, \"Daily News\" column that \"Kirkpatrick has sat in my living room on several occasions and listened attentively to performers eager to secure a certification of loyalty.\"\nCold War repercussions manifested in a different way when Bob Dylan was booked to appear in May 1963. His chosen song was \"Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues\", which poked fun at the ultraconservative John Birch Society and its tendency to see Communist conspiracies in many situations. No concern was voiced by anyone, including Sullivan, during rehearsals, but on the day of the broadcast, CBS's Standards and Practices department rejected the song, fearing that lyrics equating the Society's views with those of Adolf Hitler might trigger a defamation lawsuit. Dylan was offered the opportunity to perform a different song, but he responded that if he could not sing the number of his choice, he would rather not appear at all. The story generated widespread media attention in the days that followed; Sullivan denounced the network's decision in published interviews.\nSullivan butted heads with Standards and Practices on other occasions, as well. In 1956, Ingrid Bergman\u2014who had been living in \"exile\" in Europe since 1950 in the wake of her scandalous love affair with director Roberto Rossellini while they were both married\u2014was planning a return to Hollywood as the star of \"Anastasia\". Sullivan, confident that the American public would welcome her back, invited her to appear on his show and flew to Europe to film an interview with Bergman, Yul Brynner, and Helen Hayes on the \"Anastasia\" set. When he arrived back in New York, Standards and Practices informed Sullivan that under no circumstances would Bergman be permitted to appear on the show, either live or on film. Sullivan's prediction later proved correct, as Bergman won her second Academy Award for her portrayal, as well as the forgiveness of her fans.\nPersonal life.\nSullivan was engaged to champion swimmer Sybil Bauer, but she died of cancer in 1927 at the age of 23. In 1926, Sullivan met and began dating Sylvia Weinstein. Weinstein tried to tell her Jewish family she was dating a man named Ed Solomon, but her brother figured out she meant Ed Sullivan. With both families strongly opposed to a Catholic\u2013Jewish marriage, the affair was on-again-off-again for three years. They were finally married on April 28, 1930, in a City Hall ceremony, and 8 months later Sylvia gave birth to Elizabeth (\"Betty\"), named after Sullivan's mother, who had died that year. The Sullivans rented a suite of rooms at the Hotel Delmonico in 1944 after living at the Hotel Astor on Times Square for many years. Sullivan rented a suite next door to the family suite, which he used as an office until \"The Ed Sullivan Show\" was canceled in 1971. Sullivan was in the habit of calling his wife after every program to get her immediate critique.\nThe Sullivans were always \"on the town\", eating out five nights a week at some of the trendiest clubs and restaurants, including the Stork Club, Danny's Hide-A-Way and Jimmy Kelly's. Sullivan socialized with the rich and famous, was friends with U.S. Presidents and was given audiences with several Popes. In 1952, Betty Sullivan married the \"Ed Sullivan Show\"'s producer, Bob Precht. From the Prechts, Ed had five grandchildren\u2014Robert Edward, Carla Elizabeth, Vincent Henry, Andrew Sullivan and Margo Elizabeth. The Sullivan and Precht families were very close; Betty died on June 7, 2014, aged 83.\nLater years and death.\nIn the fall of 1965, CBS began televising its weekly programs in color. Although the Sullivan show was seen live in the Central and Eastern time zones, it was taped for airing in the Pacific and Mountain time zones. Excerpts have been released on home video and posted on the internet on the official Ed Sullivan Show web site.\nBy 1971, the show's ratings had plummeted. In an effort to refresh its lineup, CBS canceled the program in March 1971, along with some of its other long running shows throughout the 1970\u20131971 season (later known as the rural purge). Angered, Sullivan refused to host three more months of scheduled shows. They were replaced by reruns and a final program without him aired in June. He remained with the network in various other capacities and hosted a 25th anniversary special in June 1973.\nIn early September 1974, Sullivan was diagnosed with an advanced stage of esophageal cancer. Doctors gave him very little time to live, and the family chose to keep the diagnosis secret from him. Sullivan, believing his ailment to be yet another complication from a long-standing battle with gastric ulcers, died five weeks later on October 13, 1974, at New York's Lenox Hill Hospital, two weeks after his 73rd birthday. His funeral was attended by 3,000 at St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York, on a cold, rainy day. Sullivan is interred in a crypt at the Ferncliff Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York.\nSullivan has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6101 Hollywood Blvd."}
{"id": "9948", "revid": "3048957", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=9948", "title": "\u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun", "text": "\u00c9lisabeth Louise Vig\u00e9e Le Brun (also spelled Vig\u00e9e-Lebrun; ; 16 April 1755 \u2013 30 March 1842), also known as Madame Le Brun, was a prominent French portrait painter of the late 18th century.\nHer artistic style is generally considered part of the aftermath of Rococo with elements of an adopted Neoclassical style. Her subject matter and color palette can be classified as Rococo, but her style is aligned with the emergence of Neoclassicism. Vig\u00e9e Le Brun created a name for herself in Ancien R\u00e9gime society by serving as the portrait painter to Marie Antoinette. She enjoyed the patronage of European aristocrats, actors, and writers, and was elected to art academies in ten cities.\nVig\u00e9e Le Brun created some 660 portraits and 200 landscapes. In addition to many works in private collections, her paintings are owned by major museums, such as the Louvre, Hermitage Museum, National Gallery in London, Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and many other collections in continental Europe and the United States.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nBorn in Paris on 16 April 1755, \u00c9lisabeth Louise Vig\u00e9e was the daughter of Jeanne (n\u00e9e Maissin) (1728\u20131800), a hairdresser, and portraitist and fan painter Louis Vig\u00e9e, from whom she received her first instruction. In 1760, at the age of five, she entered a convent, where she remained until 1766. Her father died when she was 12 years old. In 1768, her mother married a wealthy jeweller, Jacques-Fran\u00e7ois Le S\u00e8vre, and shortly after, the family moved to the Rue Saint-Honor\u00e9, close to the Palais Royal. In her memoir, Vig\u00e9e Le Brun directly stated her feelings about her step-father: \"I hated this man; even more so since he made use of my father's personal possessions. He wore his clothes, just as they were, without altering them to fit his figure.\" During this period, \u00c9lisabeth benefited from the advice of Gabriel Fran\u00e7ois Doyen, Jean-Baptiste Greuze, and Joseph Vernet, whose influence is evident in her portrait of her younger brother, playwright and poet \u00c9tienne Vig\u00e9e (1773).\nBy the time she was in her early teens, \u00c9lisabeth was painting portraits professionally. After her studio was seized for her practicing without a license, she applied to the Acad\u00e9mie de Saint-Luc, which unwittingly exhibited her works in their Salon. In 1774, she was made a member of the Acad\u00e9mie. On 11 January 1776 she married Jean-Baptiste-Pierre Le Brun, a painter and art dealer. Vig\u00e9e Le Brun began exhibiting her work at their home in Paris, the H\u00f4tel de Lubert, and the Salons she held here supplied her with many new and important contacts. Her husband's great-great-uncle was Charles Le Brun, the first director of the French Academy under Louis XIV. Vig\u00e9e Le Brun painted portraits of many of the nobility.\nOn 12 February 1780, Vig\u00e9e-Le Brun gave birth to a daughter, Jeanne Lucie Louise, whom she called Julie and nicknamed \"Brunette.\"\nIn 1781 she and her husband toured Flanders and the Netherlands, where seeing the works of the Flemish masters inspired her to try new techniques. Her \"Self-Portrait with Straw Hat\" (1782) was a \"free imitation\" of Peter Paul Rubens' \"La Chapeau de Paille\" (ca. 1622\u20131625). Dutch and Flemish influences have also been noted in \"The Comte d'Espagnac\" (1786) and \"Madame Perregaux\" (1789).\nIn 1787, she caused a minor public scandal when her \"Self-Portrait with Her Daughter Julie\" (1787) was exhibited at the Salon of 1787 showing her smiling and open-mouthed, which was in direct contravention of traditional painting conventions going back to antiquity. The court gossip-sheet \"M\u00e9moires secrets\" commented: \"An affectation which artists, art-lovers and persons of taste have been united in condemning, and which finds no precedent among the Ancients, is that in smiling, [Madame Vig\u00e9e LeBrun] shows her teeth.\" In light of this and her other \"Self-Portrait with Her Daughter Julie\" (1789), Simone de Beauvoir dismissed Vig\u00e9e Le Brun as narcissistic in \"The Second Sex\" (1949): \"Madame Vig\u00e9e-Lebrun never wearied of putting her smiling maternity on her canvases.\"\nMarie Antoinette.\nAs her career blossomed, Vig\u00e9e Le Brun was granted patronage by Marie Antoinette. She painted more than 30 portraits of the queen and her family, leading to the common perception that she was the official portraitist of Marie Antoinette. At the Salon of 1783, Vig\u00e9e Le Brun exhibited \"Marie-Antoinette in a Muslin Dress\" (1783), sometimes called \"Marie-Antoinette en gaulle\", in which the queen chose to be shown in a simple, informal white cotton garment. The resulting scandal was prompted by both the informality of the attire and the queen's decision to be shown in that way. Vig\u00e9e Le Brun's later \"Marie-Antoinette and her Children\" (1787) was evidently an attempt to improve the queen's image by making her more relatable to the public, in the hopes of countering the bad press and negative judgments that the queen had recently received. The portrait shows the queen at home in the Palace of Versailles, engaged in her official function as the mother of the king's children, but also suggests Marie-Antoinette's uneasy identity as a foreign-born queen whose maternal role was her only true function under Salic law. The child on the right is pointing to an empty cradle, which signified her recent loss of a child, further emphasizing Marie-Antoinette's role as a mother.\nAcad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture.\nOn 31 May 1783, Vig\u00e9e Le Brun was received as a member of the Acad\u00e9mie royale de peinture et de sculpture. She was one of only 15 women to be granted full membership in the Acad\u00e9mie between 1648 and 1793. Her rival, Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Labille-Guiard, was admitted on the same day. Vig\u00e9e Le Brun was initially refused on the grounds that her husband was an art dealer, but eventually the Acad\u00e9mie was overruled by an order from Louis XVI because Marie Antoinette put considerable pressure on her husband on behalf of her portraitist. As her reception piece, Vig\u00e9e Le Brun submitted an allegorical painting, \"Peace Bringing Back Abundance\" (\"La Paix ramenant l'Abondance\"), instead of a portrait. As a consequence, the Acad\u00e9mie did not place her work within a standard category of painting\u2014either history or portraiture. Vig\u00e9e Le Brun's membership in the Acad\u00e9mie dissolved after the French Revolution because female academicians were abolished.\nExile.\nIn October 1789, after the arrest of the royal family during the French Revolution, Vig\u00e9e Le Brun fled France with her young daughter, Julie. Her husband, who remained in Paris, claimed that Vig\u00e9e Le Brun went to Italy \"to instruct and improve herself\", but she certainly feared for her own safety. In her 12-year absence from France, she lived and worked in Italy (1789\u20131792), Austria (1792\u20131795), Russia (1795\u20131801), and Germany (1801).\nItaly.\nWhile in Italy, Vig\u00e9e Le Brun was elected to the Academy in Parma (1789) and the Accademia di San Luca in Rome (1790). In Naples, she painted portraits of Maria Carolina of Austria (sister of Marie Antoinette) and her eldest four living children: Maria Teresa, Francesco, Luisa, and Maria Cristina. She later recalled that Luisa \"was extremely ugly, and pulled such faces that I was most reluctant to finish her portrait.\" Vig\u00e9e Le Brun also painted allegorical portraits of the notorious Emma Hamilton as Ariadne (1790) and as a Bacchante (ca. 1792). Lady Hamilton was similarly the model for Vig\u00e9e Le Brun's \"Sibyl\" (1792), which was inspired by the painted sibyls of Domenichino. The painting represents the Cumaean Sibyl, as indicated by the Greek inscription on the figure's scroll, which is taken from Virgil's fourth Eclogue. The \"Sibyl\" was Vig\u00e9e Le Brun's favorite painting. It is mentioned in her memoir more than any other work. She displayed it while in Venice (1792), Vienna (1792), Dresden (1794), and Saint Petersburg (1795); she also sent it to be shown at the Salon of 1798. Like her reception piece, \"Peace Bringing Back Abundance\" (1783), Vig\u00e9e Le Brun regarded her \"Sibyl\" as a history painting, the most elevated category in the Acad\u00e9mie's hierarchy.\nAustria.\nWhile in Vienna, Vig\u00e9e Le Brun was commissioned to paint \"Princess Maria Josefa Hermengilde von Esterhazy as Ariadne\" (1793) and its pendant \"Princess Karoline von Liechtenstein as Iris\" (1793). The portraits depict the Liechtenstein sisters-in-law in unornamented Roman-inspired garments that show the influence of Neoclassicism, and which may have been a reference to the virtuous republican Roman matron Cornelia, mother of the Gracchi.\nRussia.\nIn Russia, where she stayed from 1795 until 1801, she was received by the nobility and painted numerous aristocrats, including the former king of Poland, Stanis\u0142aw August Poniatowski, and members of the family of Catherine the Great. Although the French aesthetic was widely admired in Russia, there remained various cultural differences as to what was deemed acceptable. Catherine was not initially happy with Vig\u00e9e Le Brun's portrait of her granddaughters, Elena and Alexandra Pavlovna, due to the amount of bare skin the short-sleeved gowns revealed. In order to please the Empress, Vig\u00e9e Le Brun added sleeves. This tactic seemed effective in pleasing Catherine, as she agreed to sit herself for Vig\u00e9e Le Brun (although Catherine died of a stroke before this work was due to begin). While in Russia, Vig\u00e9e Le Brun was made a member of the Academy of Fine Arts of Saint Petersburg. Much to Vig\u00e9e Le Brun's dismay, her daughter Julie married Ga\u00e9tan Bernard Nigris, secretary to the Director of the Imperial Theaters of Saint Petersburg.\nReturn to France and later life.\nAfter a sustained campaign by her ex-husband and other family members to have her name removed from the list of counter-revolutionary \u00e9migr\u00e9s, Vig\u00e9e Le Brun was finally able to return to France in January 1802. She travelled to London in 1803, to Switzerland in 1807, and to Switzerland again in 1808. In Geneva, she was made an honorary member of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour l'Avancement des Beaux-Arts. She stayed at Coppet with Madame de Sta\u00ebl, who appears as the title character in \"Corinne, ou l'Italie\" (1807).\nIn her later years, Vig\u00e9e Le Brun purchased a house in Louveciennes, \u00cele-de-France, and divided her time between Louveciennes and Paris.
