{"id": "2940", "revid": "1021637600", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2940", "title": "And did those feet in ancient time", "text": "\"And did those feet in ancient time\" is a poem by William Blake from the preface to his epic ', one of a collection of writings known as the Prophetic Books. The date of 1804 on the title page is probably when the plates were begun, but the poem was printed c. 1808. Today it is best known as the hymn \"Jerusalem\"'\", with music written by Sir Hubert Parry in 1916. The famous orchestration was written by Sir Edward Elgar. It is not to be confused with another poem, much longer and larger in scope, but also by Blake, called \"Jerusalem The Emanation of the Giant Albion\".\nThe poem was supposedly inspired by the apocryphal story that a young Jesus, accompanied by Joseph of Arimathea, a tin merchant, travelled to what is now England and visited Glastonbury during his unknown years. Most scholars reject the historical authenticity of this story out of hand, and according to British folklore scholar A. W. Smith, \"there was little reason to believe that an oral tradition concerning a visit made by Jesus to Britain existed before the early part of the twentieth century\". The poem's theme is linked to the Book of Revelation ( and 21:2) describing a Second Coming, wherein Jesus establishes a New Jerusalem. Churches in general, and the Church of England in particular, have long used Jerusalem as a metaphor for Heaven, a place of universal love and peace.\nIn the most common interpretation of the poem, Blake implies that a visit by Jesus would briefly create heaven in England, in contrast to the \"dark Satanic Mills\" of the Industrial Revolution. Blake's poem asks four questions rather than asserting the historical truth of Christ's visit. Thus the poem merely wonders if there had been a divine visit, when there was briefly heaven in England. The second verse is interpreted as an exhortation to create an ideal society in England, whether or not there was a divine visit.\nText.\nThe original text is found in the preface Blake wrote for inclusion with \"Milton, a Poem\", following the lines beginning \"The Stolen and Perverted Writings of Homer &amp; Ovid: of Plato &amp; Cicero, which all Men ought to contemn: ...\"\nBlake's poem\nBeneath the poem Blake inscribed a quotation from the Bible:\n\"Dark Satanic Mills\".\n[[File:Albion Flour Mills Bankside.jpg|thumb|Albion Flour Mills, [[Bankside]], London]]\nThe phrase \"dark Satanic Mills\", which entered the English language from this poem, is often interpreted as referring to the early [[Industrial Revolution]] and its destruction of nature and human relationships. This view has been linked to the fate of the [[Albion Mills, Southwark|Albion Flour Mills]] in [[Southwark]], the first major factory in London. This rotary steam-powered flour mill by [[Matthew Boulton]] and [[James Watt]] could produce 6,000 [[bushel]]s of flour per week. The factory could have driven independent traditional millers out of business, but it was destroyed in 1791 by fire, perhaps [[Luddite|deliberately]]. London's independent millers celebrated with placards reading, \"Success to the mills of [[Albion]] but no Albion Mills.\" Opponents referred to the factory as [[satan]]ic, and accused its owners of adulterating flour and using cheap imports at the expense of British producers. A contemporary illustration of the fire shows a [[devil]] squatting on the building. The mills were a short distance from Blake's home.\nBlake's phrase resonates with a broader theme in his works, what he envisioned as a physically and spiritually [[Political repression|repressive]] ideology based on a quantified reality. Blake saw the [[cotton mill]]s and [[collieries]] of the period as a mechanism for the enslavement of millions, but the concepts underpinning the works had a wider application:\n[[File:Milton a Poem, copy C, object 4 (Bentley 4, Erdman 6, Keynes 4) detail-a.jpg|thumb|400px|The first reference to Satan's \"mills\", next to images of megaliths ([[Milton: A Poem in Two Books]], copy C, object 4)]] Another interpretation, amongst [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]]s, is that the phrase refers to the established [[Church of England]]. This church preached a doctrine of conformity to the established social order and class system, in contrast to Blake. In 2007 the new [[Bishop of Durham]], [[N. T. Wright]], explicitly recognised this element of English subculture when he acknowledged this alternative view that the \"dark satanic mills\" refer to the \"great churches\". In similar vein, the critic [[F. W. Bateson]] noted how \"the adoption by the Churches and women's organizations of this anti-clerical paean of free love is amusing evidence of the carelessness with which poetry is read\".\n[[Stonehenge]] and other megaliths are featured in \"Milton\", suggesting they may relate to the oppressive power of priestcraft in general; as [[Peter Porter (poet)|Peter Porter]] observed, many scholars argue that the \"[mills] are churches and not the factories of the Industrial Revolution everyone else takes them for\".\nAn alternative theory is that Blake is referring to a mystical concept within his own mythology related to the ancient history of England. Satan's \"mills\" are referred to repeatedly in the main poem, and are first described in words which suggest neither industrialism nor ancient megaliths, but rather something more abstract: \"the starry Mills of Satan/ Are built beneath the earth and waters of the Mundane Shell...To Mortals thy Mills seem everything, and the Harrow of [[El Shaddai|Shaddai]] / A scheme of human conduct invisible and incomprehensible\".\n\"Chariots of fire\".\nThe line from the poem \"Bring me my Chariot of fire!\" draws on the story of [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/2 Kings#2:11|2 Kings 2:11]], where the [[Old Testament]] prophet [[Elijah]] is taken directly to heaven: \"And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.\" The phrase has become a byword for divine energy, and inspired the title of the 1981 film \"[[Chariots of Fire]]\", in which the hymn Jerusalem is sung during the final scenes. The plural phrase \"chariots of fire\" refers to [[wikisource:Bible (King James)/2 Kings#6:17|2 Kings 6:17]].\n\"Green and pleasant land\".\nBlake lived in London for most of his life, but wrote much of \"Milton\" while living in the village of [[Felpham]] in Sussex. Amanda Gilroy argues that the poem is informed by Blake's \"evident pleasure\" in the Felpham countryside. However, local records from Lavant, near Chichester, state that Blake wrote the poem in an east-facing alcove of the Earl of March public house.\nThe phrase \"green and pleasant land\" has become a common term for an identifiably English landscape or society. It appears as a headline, title or sub-title in numerous articles and books. Sometimes it refers, whether with appreciation, nostalgia or critical analysis, to idyllic or enigmatic aspects of the English countryside. In other contexts it can suggest the perceived habits and aspirations of rural middle-class life. Sometimes it is used ironically, e.g. in the [[Dire Straits]] song \"[[Iron Hand (song)|Iron Hand]]\".\nRevolution.\nSeveral of Blake's poems and paintings express a notion of universal humanity: \"As all men are alike (tho' infinitely various)\". He retained an active interest in social and political events for all his life, but was often forced to resort to cloaking social idealism and political statements in Protestant mystical [[allegory]]. Even though the poem was written during the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Blake was an outspoken supporter of the [[French Revolution]], and [[Napoleon]] claimed to be continuing this revolution. The poem expressed his desire for radical change without overt sedition. In 1803 Blake was charged at [[Chichester]] with high treason for having \"uttered seditious and treasonable expressions\", but was acquitted. The poem is followed in the preface by a quotation from \"[[Book of Numbers|Numbers]]\" ch. 11, v. 29: \"Would to God that all the Lords people were prophets.\" [[Christopher Rowland (theologian)|Christopher Rowland]] has argued that this includes\neveryone in the task of speaking out about what they saw. Prophecy for Blake, however, was not a prediction of the end of the world, but telling the truth as best a person can about what he or she sees, fortified by insight and an \"honest persuasion\" that with personal struggle, things could be improved. A human being observes, is indignant and speaks out: it's a basic political maxim which is necessary for any age. Blake wanted to stir people from their intellectual slumbers, and the daily grind of their toil, to see that they were captivated in the grip of a culture which kept them thinking in ways which served the interests of the powerful.\"\nThe words of the poem \"stress the importance of people taking responsibility for change and building a better society 'in Englands green and pleasant land.'\"\nPopularisation.\nThe poem, which was little known during the century which followed its writing, was included in the patriotic anthology of verse \"The Spirit of Man,\" edited by the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom]], [[Robert Bridges]], and published in 1916, at a time when morale had begun to decline because of the high number of casualties in World War I and the perception that there was no end in sight.\nUnder these circumstances, Bridges, finding the poem an appropriate hymn text to \"brace the spirit of the nation [to] accept with cheerfulness all the sacrifices necessary,\" asked [[Hubert Parry|Sir Hubert Parry]] to put it to music for a [[Fight for Right Movement|Fight for Right campaign]] meeting in London's [[Queen's Hall]]. Bridges asked Parry to supply \"suitable, simple music to Blake's stanzas \u2013 music that an audience could take up and join in\", and added that, if Parry could not do it himself, he might delegate the task to [[George Butterworth]].\nThe poem's idealistic [[Theme (literature)|theme]] or [[subtext]] accounts for its popularity across much of the political spectrum. It was used as a campaign slogan by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945 general election]]; [[Clement Attlee]] said they would build \"a new Jerusalem\". It has been sung at conferences of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], at the [[Glee Club (British politics)|Glee Club]] of the British [[Liberal Assembly]], the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and by the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].\nParry's setting of \"Jerusalem\".\nIn adapting Blake's poem as a [[unison]] song, Parry deployed a two-[[stanza]] format, each taking up eight lines of Blake's original poem. He added a four-bar musical introduction to each verse and a [[coda (music)|coda]], echoing melodic [[motif (music)|motif]]s of the song. The word \"those\" was substituted for \"these\" before \"dark satanic mills\".\nThe piece was to be conducted by Parry's former student [[Walford Davies]], but Parry was initially reluctant to set the words, as he had doubts about the ultra-patriotism of Fight for Right, but not wanting to disappoint either Robert Bridges or Davies he agreed, writing it on 10 March 1916, and handing the manuscript to Davies with the comment, \"Here's a tune for you, old chap. Do what you like with it.\" Davies later recalled,\nDavies arranged for the vocal score to be published by [[Curwen Press|Curwen]] in time for the concert at the [[Queen's Hall]] on 28 March and began rehearsing it. It was a success and was taken up generally.\nBut Parry began to have misgivings again about Fight for Right and eventually wrote to Sir [[Francis Younghusband]] withdrawing his support entirely in May 1917. There was even concern that the composer might withdraw the song, but the situation was saved by [[Millicent Fawcett]] of the [[National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies]] (NUWSS). The song had been taken up by the Suffragists in 1917 and Fawcett asked Parry if it might be used at a Suffrage Demonstration Concert on 13 March 1918. Parry was delighted and orchestrated the piece for the concert (it had originally been for voices and organ). After the concert, Fawcett asked the composer if it might become the Women Voters' Hymn. Parry wrote back, \"I wish indeed it might become the Women Voters' hymn, as you suggest. People seem to enjoy singing it. And having the vote ought to diffuse a good deal of joy too. So they would combine happily\".\nAccordingly, he assigned the copyright to the NUWSS. When that organisation was wound up in 1928, Parry's executors reassigned the copyright to the [[Women's Institutes]], where it remained until it entered the public domain in 1968.\nThe song was first called \"And Did Those Feet in Ancient Time\" and the early published scores have this title. The change to \"Jerusalem\" seems to have been made about the time of the 1918 Suffrage Demonstration Concert, perhaps when the orchestral score was published (Parry's manuscript of the orchestral score has the old title crossed out and \"Jerusalem\" inserted in a different hand). However, Parry always referred to it by its first title. He had originally intended the first verse to be sung by a solo female voice (this is marked in the score), but this is rare in contemporary performances. Sir [[Edward Elgar]] re-scored the work for very large orchestra in 1922 for use at the [[Leeds Festival (classical music)|Leeds Festival]]. Elgar's orchestration has overshadowed Parry's own, primarily because it is the version usually used now for the [[Last Night of the Proms]] (though Sir [[Malcolm Sargent]], who introduced it to that event in the 1950s, always used Parry's version).\nUse as a hymn.\nAlthough Parry composed the music as a unison song, many churches have adopted \"Jerusalem\" as a four-part hymn; a number of English entities, including the BBC, the Crown, cathedrals, churches, and chapels regularly use it as an office or recessional hymn on [[Saint George's Day]].\nHowever, some clergy in the Church of England, according to the [[BBC TV]] programme \"Jerusalem: An Anthem for England\", have said that the song is not technically a [[hymn]] as it is not a prayer to God (which they claim hymns always are, though many counter-examples appear in any hymnal). Consequently, it is not sung in some churches in England. Despite this, it was sung as a hymn during the [[wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton]] in [[Westminster Abbey]].\nMany schools use the song, especially [[Public school (UK)|public school]]s in Great Britain (it was used as the title music for the [[BBC]]'s 1979 series \"Public School\" at [[Radley College]]), and several private schools in Australia, New Zealand, New England and Canada. In Hong Kong, diverted version of \"Jerusalem\" is also used as the school hymn of St. Catherine's School for Girls, Kwun Tong and Bishop Hall Jubilee School. \"Jerusalem\" was chosen as the opening hymn for the [[London Olympics 2012]], although \"[[God Save the Queen]]\" was the anthem sung during the raising of the flag in salute to the Queen. Some attempts have also been made to increase its use elsewhere with other words; examples include the State Funeral of President Ronald Reagan in Washington National Cathedral on 11 June 2004 and the State Memorial Service for Australian Prime Minister [[Gough Whitlam]] on 5 November 2014.\nIt has been featuring on BBC Songs Of Praise for many years and in a countrywide poll to find the UK's favourite hymn in 2019, it was voted in at Number 1, knocking previous How Great Thou Art into second place.\nUse as a national anthem.\nUpon hearing the orchestral version for the first time, [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] said that he preferred \"Jerusalem\" over the British national anthem \"[[God Save the King]]\". \"Jerusalem\" is considered to be England's most popular patriotic song; \"[[The New York Times]]\" said it was \"fast becoming an alternative national anthem,\" and there have even been calls to give it official status. England has no official anthem and uses the British national anthem \"[[God Save the Queen]]\", also unofficial, for some national occasions, such as before English international football matches. However, some sports, including [[rugby league]], use \"Jerusalem\" as the English anthem. \"Jerusalem\" is the official hymn of the [[England and Wales Cricket Board]], although \"God Save the Queen\" was the anthem sung before England's games in [[2010 ICC World Twenty20]], the [[2010\u201311 Ashes series]] and the [[2019 ICC Cricket World Cup]]. Questions in [[British Parliament|Parliament]] have not clarified the situation, as answers from the relevant minister say that since there is no official national anthem, each sport must make its own decision.\nAs Parliament has not clarified the situation, Team England, the English Commonwealth team, held a public poll in 2010 to decide which anthem should be played at medal ceremonies to celebrate an English win at the Commonwealth Games. \"Jerusalem\" was selected by 52% of voters over \"[[Land of Hope and Glory]]\" (used since 1930) and \"God Save the Queen\".\nIn 2005 [[BBC Four]] produced \"Jerusalem: An Anthem For England\" highlighting the usages of the song/poem and a case was made for its adoption as the [[national anthem of England]]. Varied contributions come from [[Howard Goodall]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Garry Bushell]], [[Lord Hattersley]], [[Ann Widdecombe]] and [[David Mellor]], [[Militarism|war proponents]], [[pacifism|war opponents]], [[suffragettes]], [[trade unionists]], [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|public schoolboys]], the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]], the [[The Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], [[Football Supporters' Federation|football supporters]], the [[British National Party]], the [[Women's Institute#.22Jerusalem.22|Women's Institute]], [[London Gay Men's Chorus|a gay choir]], [[London Community Gospel Choir|a gospel choir]], [[Fat Les]] and [[Naturists#United Kingdom|naturists]].\nEmerson, Lake and Palmer version.\nIn 1973, for their \"[[Brain Salad Surgery]]\" album, British progressive rock band [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]] recorded a version of the song titled \"Jerusalem\". The track features the debut of the prototype [[Moog Apollo]], the first-ever [[polyphonic synthesizer|polyphonic music synthesizer]]. The subject matter of this song indicates a nod to ELP's unabashed Englishness and simultaneously lent an air of timeless tradition and ceremony to the music. Though a single was released of the song, it failed to chart, and it was banned from radio play in England. The BBC would not accept it as a serious piece of music, the band claims. Drummer [[Carl Palmer]] later expressed disappointment over this decision.\nA live rendition was recorded during their subsequent \"Someone Get Me a Ladder\" tour, and was included on the live album of the band's 1974 tour \"[[Welcome Back My Friends to the Show That Never Ends \u2013 Ladies and Gentlemen|Welcome Back My Friends to the Show That Never Ends \u2013 Ladies and Gentlemen... Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]]\".\nPerformances.\nThe popularity of Parry's setting has resulted in many hundreds of recordings being made, too numerous to list, of both traditional choral performances and new interpretations by popular music artists. Consequently, only its most notable performances are listed below.\nUse in film, television and theatre.\n\"Bring me my Chariot of fire\" inspired the title of the film \"[[Chariots of Fire]]\". A church congregation sings \"Jerusalem\" at the close of the film and a performance appears on the \"[[Chariots of Fire (album)|Chariots of Fire soundtrack]]\" performed by the [[Ambrosian Singers]] overlaid partly by a composition by [[Vangelis]]. One unexpected touch is that \"Jerusalem\" is sung in four-part harmony, as if it were truly a hymn. This is not authentic: Parry's composition was a unison song (that is, all voices sing the tune \u2013 perhaps one of the things that make it so \"singable\" by massed crowds) and he never provided any harmonisation other than the accompaniment for organ (or orchestra). Neither does it appear in any standard hymn book in a guise other than Parry's own, so it may have been harmonised specially for the film. The film's working title was \"Running\" until [[Colin Welland]] saw a television programme, \"[[Songs of Praise]]\", featuring the hymn and decided to change the title.\nThe hymn has featured in many other films and television programmes including \"[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]\", \"[[How to Get Ahead in Advertising]]\", \"[[The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner (film)|The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner]]\", \"[[Saint Jack (film)|Saint Jack]]\", \"[[Calendar Girls]]\", Season 3: Episode 22 of \"[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]\", \"[[Goodnight Mister Tom (1998 film)|Goodnight Mr. Tom]]\", \"[[Women in Love]]\", \"[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]\", \"[[Shameless (UK TV series)|Shameless]]\", \"[[Jackboots on Whitehall]]\", \"[[Quatermass and the Pit]]\", and \"[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]] \". An extract was heard in the 2013 \"[[Doctor Who]]\" episode \"[[The Crimson Horror]]\" although that story was set in 1893, i.e., before Parry's arrangement. A punk version is heard in [[Derek Jarman]]'s 1977 film \"[[Jubilee (1978 film)|Jubilee]]\". In an episode of \"[[Peep Show (TV series)|Peep Show]]\", Jez ([[Robert Webb]]) records a track titled \"This Is Outrageous\" which uses the first and a version of the second line in a verse. A modified version of the hymn, replacing the word \"England\" with \"Neo\", is used in \"[[Neo Yokio]]\" as the national anthem of the eponymous city state.\nIn the theatre it appears in \"[[Jerusalem (play)|Jerusalem]]\", \"[[Calendar Girls]]\" and in \"[[Time and the Conways]]\". Eddie Izzard discusses the hymn in his 2000 \"[[Circle (Eddie Izzard)|Circle]]\" stand-up tour. Punk band [[Bad Religion]] have borrowed the opening line of Blake's poem in their \"God Song\", from the 1990 album \"[[Against the Grain (Bad Religion album)|Against the Grain]]\".\nOther composers.\nBlake's lyrics have also been set to music by other composers without reference to Parry's melody. [[Tim Blake]] (synthesiser player of [[Gong (band)|Gong]]) produced a solo album in 1978 called \"[[Blake's New Jerusalem]]\", including a 20-minute track with lyrics from Blake's poem. [[Mark E. Smith]] of [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]] interpolated the verses with a deadpan rant against his native land in the track \"Dog is life/Jerusalem\" from the 1988 ballet score \"[[I Am Kurious Oranj]]\". The words, with some variations, are used in the track \"Jerusalem\" on [[Bruce Dickinson]]'s album \"[[The Chemical Wedding (Bruce Dickinson album)|The Chemical Wedding]]\", which also includes lines from book two of \"Milton\". [[Finn Coren]] also created a different musical setting for the poem on his album \"[[The Blake Project: Spring]]\". [[The Verve]] also referenced the song in their 2008 song \"[[Love Is Noise]]\" from the album [[Forth (album)|Forth.]] Lead singer and writer [[Richard Ashcroft]] said that Blake had influenced the lyric \"'Will those feet in modern times\"' from the song. This is not the first Verve song influenced by Blake, as their previous single \"[[History (The Verve song)|History]]\" also featured the lyrics \"I wandered lonely streets/Behind where the old Thames does flow/And in every face I meet\", referencing Blake's \"[[London (William Blake poem)|London]]\".\nExternal links.\n[[Category:1804 poems]]\n[[Category:1916 songs]]\n[[Category:English Christian hymns]]\n[[Category:English patriotic songs]]\n[[Category:National symbols of England]]\n[[Category:Poetry by William Blake]]\n[[Category:Adaptations of works by William Blake]]\n[[Category:British Israelism]]\n[[Category:Culture of Jerusalem]]\n[[Category:Musical settings of poems by William Blake]]\n[[Category:British anthems]]"}

Inspired by the 1955 Ingmar Bergman film \"Smiles of a Summer Night\", it involves the romantic lives of several couples. Its title is a literal English translation of the German name for Mozart's Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major, \"Eine kleine Nachtmusik\". The musical includes the popular song \"Send In the Clowns\".\nSince its original 1973 Broadway production, the musical has enjoyed professional productions in the West End, by opera companies, in a 2009 Broadway revival, and elsewhere, and it is a popular choice for regional groups. It was adapted for film in 1977, with Harold Prince directing and Elizabeth Taylor, Len Cariou, Lesley-Anne Down, and Diana Rigg starring.\nSynopsis.\nAct One.\nThe setting is Sweden, around the year 1900. One by one, the Quintet \u2013 five singers who comment like a Greek chorus throughout the show \u2013 enter, tuning up. Gradually, their vocalizing becomes an overture blending fragments of \"Remember\", \"Soon\" and \"The Glamorous Life\", leading into the first \"Night Waltz\". The other characters enter waltzing, each uncomfortable with her partner. After they drift back off, the aging and sardonic Madame Armfeldt and her solemn granddaughter, Fredrika, enter. Madame Armfeldt tells the child that the summer night \"smiles\" three times: first on the young, second on fools, and third on the old. Fredrika vows to watch the smiles occur. Middle-aged Fredrik Egerman is a successful lawyer. He has recently married an 18-year-old trophy wife, Anne, a naive girl who loves Fredrik but is too immature to grasp the concept of marriage. The two have been married for eleven months, but Anne still protects her virginity. Fredrik plots how he might seduce his wife (\"Now\"). Meanwhile, his son Henrik, a seminary student a year older than his stepmother, is frustrated and ignored (\"Later\"). Anne promises her husband that shortly she will consent to have sex (\"Soon\"), which leads into all three of them lamenting at once. Anne's maidservant Petra, an experienced and forthright girl, slightly older than the teen herself, offers her worldly but crass advice.\nDesiree Armfeldt is a prominent and glamorous actress who is now reduced to touring in small towns. Madam Armfeldt, Desiree's mother, has taken over the care of Desiree's daughter Fredrika. Fredrika misses her mother, but Desiree continually delays going to see her, preferring, somewhat ironically, \"The Glamorous Life\". She is performing near Fredrik's home, and Fredrik brings Anne to see the play. While there, Desiree notices Fredrik in the audience; the two had been lovers years earlier. Anne, suspicious and annoyed at Desiree's amorous glances, demands that Fredrik take her home immediately. Meanwhile, Petra tries to seduce a nervous and petulant Henrik.\nThat night, as Fredrik remembers his past with Desiree, he sneaks out to see her; the two have a happy but strained reunion as they \"Remember\". They reflect on their new lives, and Fredrik tries to explain how much he loves Anne (\"You Must Meet My Wife\"). Desiree responds sarcastically and boasts of her own adultery, as she has been seeing the married dragoon, Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm. Upon learning that Fredrik has gone for eleven months without sex, she agrees to accommodate him as a favor for an old friend.\nMadam Armfeldt offers advice to young Fredrika. The elderly woman reflects poignantly on her own checkered past, and wonders what happened to her refined \"Liaisons\". Back in Desiree's apartment, Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm proclaims his unannounced arrival in his usual booming tones. Fredrik and Desiree fob off the Count with an innocent explanation for their disheveled appearance, but he is still suspicious. He instantly dislikes Fredrik and returns to his wife, Countess Charlotte. Charlotte is quite aware of her husband's infidelity, but Carl-Magnus is too absorbed in his suspicions of Desiree to talk to her (\"In Praise of Women\"). When she persuades him to blurt out the whole story, a twist is revealed\u2014Charlotte's little sister is a schoolfriend of Anne's.\nCharlotte visits Anne and describes Fredrik's tryst with Desiree. Anne is shocked and saddened, but Charlotte explains that such is the lot of a wife, and love brings pain (\"Every Day a Little Death\"). Meanwhile, Desiree asks Madam Armfeldt to host a party for Fredrik, Anne and Henrik. Though reluctant, Madam Armfeldt agrees. She sends out a personal invitation; its receipt sends Anne into a frenzy, imagining \"A Weekend in the Country\" with the Armfeldts. Anne does not want to accept the invitation, but Charlotte convinces her to do so to heighten the contrast between the older woman and the young and beautiful teenager. Charlotte relates this to the Count, who (much to her chagrin) decides to visit the Armfeldts uninvited. Carl-Magnus plans to challenge Fredrik to a duel, while Charlotte hopes to seduce the lawyer to make her husband jealous and end his philandering. The act ends as all characters set off to Madam Armfeldt's estate.\nAct Two.\nMadam Armfeldt's country estate is bathed in the golden glow of perpetual summer sunset at this high latitude (\"Night Waltz One and Two\"). Everyone arrives, each with their own amorous purposes and desires\u2014even Petra, who catches the eye of Armfeldt's fetching manservant, Frid. The women begin to quarrel with one another. Fredrik is astonished to learn the name of Desiree's daughter. Henrik meets Fredrika, and confesses his deep love for Anne to her. Meanwhile, in the garden, Fredrik and Carl-Magnus reflect on how difficult it is to be annoyed with Desiree, agreeing \"It Would Have Been Wonderful\" had she not been quite so wonderful. Dinner is served, and the characters' \"Perpetual Anticipation\" enlivens the meal.\nAt dinner, Charlotte attempts to flirt with Fredrik, and trades insults with Desiree. Soon, everyone is shouting and scolding everyone else, except for Henrik, who finally speaks up. He accuses the whole company of being amoral, and flees the scene. Stunned, everyone reflects on the situation and wanders away. Fredrika tells Anne of Henrik's secret love, and the two dash off searching for him. Meanwhile, Desiree meets Fredrik and asks if he still wants to be \"rescued\" from his life. Fredrik answers honestly that he loves Desiree, but cannot bring himself to part with Anne. Hurt and bitter, Desiree can only reflect on the nature of her life and relationship to Fredrik (\"Send In the Clowns\"). Anne finds Henrik, who is attempting to commit suicide. The clumsy boy cannot complete the task, and Anne tells him that she loves him, too. The pair begins to kiss, which leads to Anne's first sexual encounter. Meanwhile, not far away, Frid sleeps in Petra's lap. The maid imagines advantageous marriages, but concludes that in the meantime, \"a girl ought to celebrate what passes by\" (\"The Miller's Son\"). Charlotte confesses her plan to Fredrik, and both watch as Henrik and Anne, happy together, run away to start their new life. The two commiserate on a bench. Carl-Magnus, preparing to romance Desiree, sees this and challenges Fredrik to Russian Roulette, at which a nervous Fredrik misfires and simply grazes his own ear. Victorious, Carl-Magnus begins to romance Charlotte, granting her wish at last.\nAfter the Count and Countess leave, Fredrika and Madam Armfeldt discuss the chaos of the recent turns-of-events. The elderly woman then asks Fredrika a surprising question: \"What is it all for?\" Fredrika thinks about this, and decides that love, for all of its frustrations, \"must be worth it\". Madam Armfeldt is surprised, ruefully noting that she rejected love for material wealth at Fredrika's age. She praises her granddaughter and remembers true love's fleeting nature.\nFredrik finally confesses his love for Desiree, acknowledging that Fredrika is his daughter, and the two promise to start a new life together (\"Send in the Clowns\" (Reprise)). Madam Armfeldt sits alone with Fredrika. Fredrika tells her grandmother that she has watched carefully, but still has not seen the night smile. Madam Armfeldt laughs and points out that the night has indeed smiled twice: first on Henrik and Anne, the young, and second on Desiree and Fredrik, the fools. As the two wait for the \"third smile... on the old\", it occurs: Madam Armfeldt closes her eyes, and dies peacefully with Fredrika beside her.\nMusical numbers.\nStage:\nScreen:\nProductions.\nOriginal Broadway production.\n\"A Little Night Music\" opened on Broadway at the Shubert Theatre on February 25, 1973.

This critically acclaimed production transferred to the Garrick Theatre in the West End for a limited season, opening on March 28, 2009 and running until July 25, 2009. The production then transferred to Broadway with a new cast.\n2009 Broadway revival.\nThe 2008 Menier Chocolate Factory production opened on Broadway at the Walter Kerr Theatre in previews on November 24, 2009 and officially on December 13, 2009, with the same creative team. The cast starred Angela Lansbury as Madame Armfeldt and, in her Broadway debut, Catherine Zeta-Jones as Desiree. Also featured were Alexander Hanson as Frederik, Ramona Mallory (the daughter of original Broadway cast members Victoria Mallory and Mark Lambert) as Anne, Hunter Ryan Herdlicka as Henrik, Leigh Ann Larkin as Petra, Erin Davie as the Countess, Aaron Lazar as the Count, and Bradley Dean as Frid. Zeta-Jones received the award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical at the 64th Tony Awards.\nOriginally, Katherine Doherty and Keaton Whittaker played Fredrika in alternating performances, beginning with the November 2009 previews. The official show album, which was recorded in January 2010, features both Doherty and Whittaker as Fredrika (on different songs). However, Katherine McNamara replaced Doherty in February 2010. McNamara and Whittaker stayed with the production until it ended in January 2011.\nWhen the contracts of Zeta-Jones and Lansbury ended, the production temporarily closed on June 20, 2010 and resumed on July 13, with new stars Bernadette Peters as Desiree Armfeldt and Elaine Stritch as Madame Armfeldt. In an interview, Peters said that Sondheim had \"proposed the idea to her this spring and urged the producers of the revival to cast her.\" Trevor Nunn directed rehearsals with the two new stars, and the rest of the original cast remained. Peters and Stritch extended their contracts until January 9, 2011, when the production closed with 20 previews and 425 regular performances. Before the production closed, it recouped its initial investment.\nEurope.\nZarah Leander played Madame Armfeldt in the original Austrian staging (in 1975) as well as in the original Swedish staging in Stockholm in 1978 (here with Jan Malmsj\u00f6 as Fredrik Egerman), performing \"Send In The Clowns\" and \"Liaisons\" in both stagings. The successful Stockholm staging was directed by Stig Olin. In 2010 the musical was scheduled to return to Stockholm and the Stockholm Stadsteater. The cast included Pia Johansson, Dan Ekborg, Yvonne Lombard and Th\u00e9rese Andersson.\nThe Th\u00e9\u00e2tre du Ch\u00e2telet, Paris production ran from February 15, 2010 through February 20, 2010. Lee Blakeley directed and Andrew George was the choreographer. Italian-born actress Greta Scacchi played D\u00e9sir\u00e9e, and Leslie Caron played Madame Armfeldt.\nThe Turku City Theatre staged the musical in 2011 with Kirsi Tarvainen in the role as D\u00e9sir\u00e9e. Tuomas Parkkinen directed and Jussi Vahvaselk\u00e4 was musical director.\nOpera companies.\nThe musical has also become part of the repertoire of a few opera companies. Michigan Opera Theatre was the first major American opera company to present the work in 1983, and again in November 2009. Light Opera Works (Evanston, IL) produced the work in August 1983. New York City Opera staged it in 1990, 1991 and 2003, the Houston Grand Opera in 1999, the Los Angeles Opera in 2004, and Hartford Opera Theater in 2014. New York City Opera's production in August 1990 and July 1991 (a total of 18 performances) won the 1990 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Revival and was telecast on the PBS show \"Live at Lincoln Center\" on November 7, 1990. The cast included both stage performers: Sally Ann Howes and George Lee Andrews as Desiree and Frederick and opera regular Regina Resnik as Madame Armfeldt (in 1991). The 2003 production featured a young Anna Kendrick as Fredrika Armfeldt, alongside Jeremy Irons as Frederick, Juliet Stevenson as Desiree, Claire Bloom as Madame Armfeldt, Danny Gurwin as Henrik, Michele Pawk as Charlotte, and Marc Kudisch as Carl-Magnus.\nOpera Australia presented the piece in Melbourne in May 2009, starring Sigrid Thornton as Desiree Armfeldt and Nancye Hayes as Madame Armfeldt. The production returned in 2010 at the Sydney Opera House with Anthony Warlow taking on the role of Fredrik Egerman. The production was directed by Stuart Maunder, designed by Roger Kirk, and conducted by Andrew Greene. Opera Theatre of Saint Louis performed the musical in June 2010. Designer Isaac Mizrahi directed and designed the production, with a cast that starred Amy Irving, Si\u00e2n Phillips and Ron Raines.\nThe piece has also become a popular choice for amateur musical theatre and light opera companies. In 2017, the musical was performed by students at The Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.\nFilm adaptation.\nA film version of \"A Little Night Music\" was released in 1977, starring Elizabeth Taylor, Lesley-Anne Down and Diana Rigg, with Len Cariou, Hermione Gingold and Laurence Guittard reprising their Broadway roles. The setting for the film was moved from Sweden to Austria. Stephen Sondheim wrote lyrics for the \"Night Waltz\" theme (\"Love Takes Time\") and wrote an entirely new version of \"The Glamorous Life\", which has been incorporated into several subsequent productions of the stage musical. However, other songs, including \"In Praise of Women\", \"The Miller's Son\" and \"Liaisons\", were cut and remain heard only as background orchestrations. The film marked Broadway director Hal Prince's second time as a motion picture director. Critical reaction to the film was mostly negative, with much being made of Taylor's wildly fluctuating weight from scene to scene. Some critics talked more positively of the film, with \"Variety\" calling it \"an elegant looking, period romantic charade\". There was praise for Diana Rigg's performance, and orchestrator Jonathan Tunick received an Oscar for his work on the score. A soundtrack recording was released on LP, and a DVD release was issued in June 2007.\nMusic analysis.\nThe score for \"A Little Night Music\" presents performance challenges more often seen in operetta or light opera pieces than in standard musical comedy. The demands made on the singing cast are considerable; although the vocal demands of the role of Desiree are rather small, most of the other singing roles require strong, legitimately-trained voices with fairly wide ranges. Sondheim's liberal use of counterpoint extends to the vocal parts, including a free-structured round (the trio \"Perpetual Anticipation\") as well as songs in which characters engage in interior monologues or even overt dialogue simultaneously (\"Now/Later/Soon\", \"A Weekend in the Country\"). Critic Rex Reed noted that \"The score of 'Night Music' ...contains patter songs, contrapuntal duets and trios, a quartet, and even a dramatic double quintet to puzzle through. All this has been gorgeously orchestrated by Jonathan Tunick; there is no rhythm section, only strings and woodwinds to carry the melodies and harmonies aloft.\"\nSondheim's engagement with threes extends to his lyrics. He organizes trios with the singers separated, while his duets are sung together, about a third person.\nThe work is performed as an operetta in many professional opera companies. For example, it was added to the New York City Opera Company repertoire in 1990.\ntime.\nVirtually all of the music in the show is written in waltz meter (time). Some parts adopt compound meter, with a time signature such as . Passages in \"Overture\", \"Glamorous Life\", \"Liaisons\", and \"The Miller's Son\" are in duple meter.\nCounterpoint and polyphony.\nAt several points, Sondheim has multiple performers each sing a different song simultaneously. This use of counterpoint maintains coherence even as it extends the notion of a round, familiar in songs such as the traditional \"Fr\u00e8re Jacques\", into something more complex. Sondheim said: \"As for the three songs ... going together well, I might as well confess. In those days I was just getting into contrapuntal and choral writing...and I wanted to develop my technique by writing a trio. What I didn't want to do is the quodlibet method...wouldn't it be nice to have three songs you don't think are going to go together, and they do go together ... The trick was the little vamp on \"Soon\" which has five-and six-note chords.\" Steve Swayne comments that the \"contrapuntal episodes in the extended ensembles ... stand as testament to his interest in Counterpoint.\"\n\"Send In The Clowns\".\nThe show's best-known and Sondheim's biggest hit song was almost an afterthought, written several days before the start of out-of-town tryouts. Sondheim initially conceived Desiree as a role for a more or less non-singing actress. When he discovered that the original Desiree, Glynis Johns, was able to sing (she had a \"small, silvery voice\") but could not \"sustain a phrase\", he devised the song \"Send in the Clowns\" for her in a way that would work around her vocal weakness, e.g., by ending lines with consonants that made for a short cut-off. \"It is written in short phrases in order to be acted rather than sung ... tailor-made for Glynis Johns, who lacks the vocal power to sustain long phrases.\"\nIn analyzing the text of the song, Max Cryer wrote that it \"is not intended to be sung by the young in love, but by a mature performer who has seen it all before. The song remains an anthem to regret for unwise decisions in the past and recognition that there's no need to send in the clowns \u2013 they're already here.\"\nGraham Wolfe has argued, \"What Desir\u00e9e is referring to in the famous song is a conventional device to cover over a moment when something has gone wrong on stage. Midway through the second Act she has deviated from her usual script by suggesting to Fredrik the possibility of being together seriously and permanently, and, having been rejected, she falters \"as\" a show-person, finds herself bereft of the capacity to improvise and wittily cover. If Desir\u00e9e could perform at this moment \u2013 revert to the innuendos, one-liners and blithe self-referential humour that constitutes her normal character \u2013 all would be well. She cannot, and what follows is an exemplary manifestation of Sondheim\u2019s musico-dramatic complexity, his inclination to write music that performs drama. That is, what needs to be covered over (by the clowns sung about in the song) is the very intensity, ragged emotion and utter vulnerability that comes forward through the music and singing itself, a display protracted to six minutes, wrought with exposed silences, a shocked Fredrik sitting so uncomfortably before Desir\u00e9e while something much too real emerges in a realm where he \u2013 and his audience \u2013 felt assured of performance.\"\nInfluences.\nThere is a Mozart reference in the title\u2014\"A Little Night Music\" is an occasionally-used translation of \"Eine kleine Nachtmusik\", the nickname of Mozart's Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major, K. 525. The elegant, harmonically-advanced music in this musical pays indirect homage to the compositions of Maurice Ravel, especially his \"Valses nobles et sentimentales\" (whose opening chord is borrowed for the opening chord of the song \"Liaisons\"); part of this effect stems from the style of orchestration that Jonathan Tunick used. There is also a direct quotation in 'A Weekend in the Country' (just as it moves to A major) of Octavian's theme from Strauss' 'Der Rosenkavalier', another comedy of manners with partner-swapping at its heart.\nCast recordings.\nIn addition to the original Broadway and London cast recordings, and the motion picture soundtrack (no longer available), there are recordings of the 1990 studio cast, the 1995 Royal National Theatre revival (starring Judi Dench), and the 2001 Barcelona cast recording sung in Catalan. In 1997 an all-jazz version of the score was recorded by Terry Trotter.\nThe 2009 Broadway revival with Catherine Zeta-Jones and Angela Lansbury recorded a cast album on January 4, 2010, which was released on April 6.\nCritical response.\nIn his review of the original 1973 Broadway production, Clive Barnes in \"The New York Times\" called the musical \"heady, civilized, sophisticated and enchanting.\" He noted that \"the real triumph belongs to Stephen Sondheim...the music is a celebration of 3/4 time, an orgy of plaintively memorable waltzes, all talking of past loves and lost worlds...There is a peasant touch here.\" He commented that the lyrics are \"breathtaking\".\nIn its review of the 1989 London revival, the reviewer for \"The Guardian\" wrote that the \"production also strikes me as infinitely superior to Harold Prince's 1975 version at the Adelphi. Mr Judge's great innovation is to transform the Liebeslieder Singers from the evening-dressed, after-dinner line-up into 18th century ghosts weaving in and out of the action...But Mr Judge's other great realisation is that, in Sondheim, the lyrics are not an adornment to a song but their very essence: understand them and the show will flow. Thus Dorothy Tutin as Desiree, the touring thesp eventually reunited with her quondam lover, is not the melting romantic of previous productions but a working mother with the sharpness of a hat-pin.\"\nThe \"Independent\" review of the 1995 National Theatre revival praised the production, writing \"For three hours of gloriously barbed bliss and bewitchment, Sean Mathias's production establishes the show as a minor miracle of astringent worldly wisdom and one that is haunted by less earthy intimations.\" The review went on to state that \"The heart of the production, in both senses, is Judi Dench's superb Desiree Armfeldt...Her husky-voiced rendering of \"Send in the Clowns\" is the most moving I've ever heard.\"\nIn reviewing the 2008 Menier Chocolate Factory production, the \"Telegraph\" reviewer wrote that \"Sondheim's lyrics are often superbly witty, his music here, mostly in haunting waltz-time, far more accessible than is sometimes the case. The score positively throbs with love, regret and desire.\" But of the specific production, the reviewer went on to note: \"But Nunn's production, on one of those hermetic sets largely consisting of doors and tarnished mirrors that have become such a clich\u00e9 in recent years, never penetrates the work's subtly erotic heart. And as is often the case with this director's work, the pace is so slow and the mood so reverent, that initial enchantment gives way to bored fidgeting.\"\nIn his \"New York Times\" review of the 2009 Broadway production, Ben Brantley noted that \"the expression that hovers over Trevor Nunn's revival...feels dangerously close to a smirk...It is a smirk shrouded in shadows. An elegiac darkness infuses this production.\" The production is \"sparing on furniture and heavy on shadows\", with \"a scaled-down orchestra at lugubriously slowed-down tempos...\" He goes on to write that \"this somber, less-is-more approach could be effective were the ensemble plugged into the same rueful sensibility. But there is only one moment in this production when all its elements cohere perfectly. That moment, halfway through the first act, belongs to Ms. Lansbury, who has hitherto been perfectly entertaining, playing Madame Armfeldt with the overripe aristocratic condescension of a Lady Bracknell. Then comes her one solo, \"Liaisons\", in which her character thinks back on the art of love as a profession in a gilded age, when sex 'was but a pleasurable means to a measurable end.' Her face, with its glamour-gorgon makeup, softens, as Madame Armfeldt seems to melt into memory itself, and the wan stage light briefly appears to borrow radiance from her. It's a lovely example of the past reaching out to the present...\"\nSteven Suskin, reviewing the new Broadway cast for \"Variety\", wrote \"What a difference a diva makes. Bernadette Peters steps into the six-month-old revival of \"A Little Night Music\" with a transfixing performance, playing it as if she realizes her character's onstage billing -- \"the one and only Desiree Armfeldt\"\u2014is clich\u00e9d hyperbole. By figuratively rolling her eyes at the hype, Peters gives us a rich, warm and comedically human Desiree, which reaches full impact when she pierces the fa\u00e7ade with a nakedly honest, tears-on-cheek 'Send in the Clowns.'\""}
{"id": "2943", "revid": "39928400", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2943", "title": "Dual wield", "text": "Dual wielding is the technique of using two weapons, one in each hand for training or combat. It is not a common combat practice. Although historical records of dual wielding in war are limited, there are numerous weapon-based martial arts that involve the use of a pair of weapons. The use of a companion weapon is sometimes employed in European martial arts and fencing, such as a parrying dagger. Miyamoto Musashi, a Japanese swordsman and \"ronin\", was said to have conceived of the idea of a particular style of swordsmanship involving the use of two swords.\nIn terms of firearms, especially handguns, dual wielding is generally denounced by firearm enthusiasts due to its impracticality. Though using two handguns at the same time confers an advantage by allowing more ready ammunition, it is rarely done due to other aspects of weapons handling. Dual wielding, both with melee and ranged weapons, has been popularized by fictional works (film, television, and video games).\nHistory.\nDual wielding has not been used or mentioned much in military history, though it appears in weapon-based martial arts and fencing practices. \nThe use of weapon combinations in each hand has been mentioned for close combat in western Europe during the Byzantine, Medieval, and Renaissance era. The use of a parrying dagger such as a main gauche along with a rapier is common in historical European martial arts. \nTraditional schools of Japanese martial arts include dual wield techniques, particularly a style conceived by Miyamoto Musashi involving the katana and wakizashi, two-sword kenjutsu techniques he called \"Niten Ichi-ry\u016b\". Eskrima, the traditional martial arts of the Philippines teaches \"Doble Baston\" techniques involving the basic use of a pair of rattan sticks and also Espada y daga or Sword/Stick and Dagger. Okinawan martial arts have a method that uses a pair of \"sai\". Chinese martial arts involve the use of a pair of butterfly swords and hook swords. Gatka, a weapon-based martial art from the Punjab region, is known to use two sticks at a time. The Thailand weapon-based martial art Krabi Krabong involves the use of a separate \"Krabi\" in each hand. Kalaripayattu teaches advanced students to use either two sticks (of various sizes) or two daggers or two swords, simultaneously. One of the oldest mentions of dual wielding are the gladiator style known as dimachaerus, where a gladiator would use two swords of the same length, sometimes straight and sometimes crooked midways up the blade. North American Indian tribes of the Atlantic northeast used a form involving a tomahawk in the primary hand and a knife in the secondary. It is practiced today as part of the modern Cree martial art Okichitaw.\nAll the above-mentioned examples, involve either one long and one short weapon, or two short weapons. An example of a dual wield of two sabres is the Ukrainian cossack dance hopak.\nThe use of a gun in each hand is often associated with the American Old West, mainly due to media portrayals. It was common for people in the era to carry two guns, but not to use them at the same time, as shown in movies. The other pistol was used as a back-up weapon.\nHowever, there were several examples of gunmen in the West who actually used two pistols at the same time in their gunfights: \nModern times.\nDual wielding two handguns was said to have been popularized by the passion of film and television.\nIn \"MythBusters\", there is an episode in which they compared many firing stances, including having a gun in each hand and found that, compared to the two-handed single-gun stance as a benchmark, only the one-handed shoulder-level stance with a single gun was comparable in terms of accuracy and speed. The ability to look down the sights of the gun was given as the main reason for this. In an episode the following year, they compared holding two guns and firing simultaneously\u2014rather than alternating left and right shots\u2014with holding one gun in the two-handed stance, and found that the results were in favor of using two guns and firing simultaneously."}
{"id": "2944", "revid": "7471214", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2944", "title": "Ariel Sharon", "text": "Ariel Sharon (; , ', also known by his diminutive Arik, , born Ariel Scheinermann, ; 26 February 1928 \u2013 11 January 2014) was an Israeli general and politician who served as the 11th Prime Minister of Israel from March 2001 until April 2006.\nSharon was a commander in the Israeli Army from its creation in 1948. As a soldier and then an officer, he participated prominently in the 1948 Palestine war, becoming a platoon commander in the Alexandroni Brigade and taking part in many battles, including Operation Bin Nun Alef. He was an instrumental figure in the creation of Unit 101 and the reprisal operations, as well as in the 1956 Suez Crisis, the Six-Day War of 1967, the War of Attrition, and the Yom-Kippur War of 1973. Yitzhak Rabin has called Sharon \"the greatest field commander in our history\".\nUpon retirement from the military, Sharon entered politics, joining the Likud party, and served in a number of ministerial posts in Likud-led governments in 1977\u201392 and 1996\u201399. As Minister of Defense, he directed the 1982 Lebanon War. An official enquiry found that he bore \"personal responsibility\" for the Sabra and Shatila massacre and recommended that he be removed as Defense Minister. His role in the massacre led to him being known as the \"Butcher of Beirut\" among Arabs.\nFrom the 1970s through to the 1990s, Sharon championed construction of Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He became the leader of the Likud in 2000, and served as Israel's prime minister from 2001 to 2006, during the Al-Aqsa Intifada. As Prime Minister, Sharon orchestrated Israel's unilateral disengagement from the Gaza Strip in 2004\u201305. Facing stiff opposition to this policy within the Likud, in November 2005 he left Likud to form a new party, Kadima. He had been expected to win the next election and was widely interpreted as planning on \"clearing Israel out of most of the West Bank\", in a series of unilateral withdrawals. After suffering a stroke on 4 January 2006, Sharon remained in a permanent vegetative state until his death in January 2014.\nEarly life and education.\nSharon was born on 26 February 1928 in Kfar Malal, an agricultural moshav, then in Mandatory Palestine, to Shmuel Scheinerman (1896\u20131956) of Brest-Litovsk and Vera (n\u00e9e Schneirov) Scheinerman (1900\u20131988) of Mogilev. His parents met while at university in Tiflis (now Tbilisi, Republic of Georgia), where Sharon's father was studying agronomy and his mother was studying medicine. They immigrated to Mandatory Palestine in 1922 in the wake of the Russian Communist government's growing persecution of Jews in the region. In Palestine, Vera Scheinerman went by the name Dvora.\nThe family arrived with the Third Aliyah and settled in Kfar Malal, a socialist, secular community. (Ariel Sharon himself would remain proudly secular throughout his life.) Although his parents were Mapai supporters, they did not always accept communal consensus: \"The Scheinermans' eventual ostracism ... followed the 1933 Arlozorov murder when Dvora and Shmuel refused to endorse the Labor movement's anti-Revisionist calumny and participate in Bolshevik-style public revilement rallies, then the order of the day. Retribution was quick to come. They were expelled from the local health-fund clinic and village synagogue. The cooperative's truck wouldn't make deliveries to their farm nor collect produce.\"\nSharon spoke both Hebrew and Russian.\nFour years after their arrival at Kfar Malal, the Sheinermans had a daughter, Yehudit (Dita). Ariel was born two years later. At age 10, he joined the youth movement HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed. As a teenager, he began to take part in the armed night-patrols of his moshav. In 1942 at the age of 14, Sharon joined the Gadna, a paramilitary youth battalion, and later the Haganah, the underground paramilitary force and the Jewish military precursor to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF).\nMilitary career.\nBattle for Jerusalem and 1948 War.\nSharon's unit of the Haganah became engaged in serious and continuous combat from the autumn of 1947, with the onset of the Battle for Jerusalem. Without the manpower to hold the roads, his unit took to making offensive hit-and-run raids on Arab forces in the vicinity of Kfar Malal. In units of thirty men, they would hit constantly at Arab villages, bridges and bases, as well as ambush the traffic between Arab villages and bases.\nSharon wrote in his autobiography: \"We had become skilled at finding our way in the darkest nights and gradually we built up the strength and endurance these kind of operations required. Under the stress of constant combat we drew closer to one another and began to operate not just as a military unit but almost as a family. ... [W]e were in combat almost every day. Ambushes and battles followed each other until they all seemed to run together.\"\nFor his role in a night-raid on Iraqi forces at Bir Adas, Sharon was made a platoon commander in the Alexandroni Brigade. Following the Israeli Declaration of Independence and the onset of the War of Independence, his platoon fended off the Iraqi advance at Kalkiya. Sharon was regarded as a hardened and aggressive soldier, swiftly moving up the ranks during the war. He was shot in the groin, stomach and foot by the Jordanian Arab Legion in the First Battle of Latrun, an unsuccessful attempt to relieve the besieged Jewish community of Jerusalem. Sharon wrote of the casualties in the \"horrible battle,\" and his brigade suffered 139 deaths.\nJordanian field marshal Habis Al-Majali claimed that Sharon was among 6 Israeli soldiers captured by the Jordanian 4th battalion during the battle, and that Habis took them to a camp in Mafraq and the 6 were later traded back. Sharon denied the claims, but Habes was adamant. \"Sharon is like a grizzly bear,\" he grumbled. \"I captured him, I healed his wounds.\" In 1994 and during the peace treaty signing ceremony with Jordan, Sharon wanted to get in touch with his former captor, but the latter determinedly refused to discuss the incident publicly.\nAfter recovering from the wounds received at Latrun, he resumed command of his patrol unit. On 28 December 1948, his platoon attempted to break through an Egyptian stronghold in Iraq-El-Manshia. At about this time, Israeli founding father David Ben-Gurion gave him the Hebraized name \"Sharon\". In September 1949, Sharon was promoted to company commander (of the Golani Brigade's reconnaissance unit) and in 1950 to intelligence officer for Central Command. He then took leave to begin studies in history and Middle Eastern culture at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Sharon's subsequent military career would be characterized by insubordination, aggression and disobedience, but also brilliance as a commander.\nUnit 101.\nA year and a half later, on the direct orders of the Prime Minister, Sharon returned to active service in the rank of major, as the founder and commander of the new Unit 101, a special forces unit tasked with reprisal operations in response to Palestinian fedayeen attacks. The first Israeli commando unit, Unit 101 specialized in offensive guerrilla warfare in enemy countries. The unit consisted of 50 men, mostly former paratroopers and Unit 30 personnel. They were armed with non-standard weapons and tasked with carrying out special reprisals across the state's borders\u2014 mainly establishing small unit maneuvers, activation and insertion tactics. Training included engaging enemy forces across Israel's borders. Israeli historian Benny Morris describes Unit 101:\nUnit 101 undertook a series of raids against Jordan, which then held the West Bank. The raids also helped bolster Israeli morale and convince Arab states that the fledgling nation was capable of long-range military action. Known for raids against Arab civilians and military targets, the unit is held responsible for the widely condemned Qibya massacre in the fall of 1953. After a group of Palestinians used Qibya as a staging point for a fedayeen attack in Yehud that killed a Jewish woman and her two children in Israel, Unit 101 retaliated on the village. By various accounts of the ensuing attack, 65 to 70 Palestinian civilians, half of them women and children, were killed when Sharon's troops dynamited 45 houses and a school.\nFacing international condemnation for the attack, Ben-Gurion denied that the Israeli military was involved. In his memoir, Sharon wrote that the unit had checked all the houses before detonating the explosives and that he thought the houses were empty. Although he admitted the results were tragic, Sharon defended the attack, however: \"Now people could feel that the terrorist gangs would think twice before striking, now that they knew for sure they would be hit back. Kibbya also put the Jordanian and Egyptian governments on notice that if Israel was vulnerable, so were they.\"\nA few months after its founding, Unit 101 was merged with the 890 Paratroopers Battalion to create the Paratroopers Brigade, of which Sharon would also later become commander. Like Unit 101, it continued raids into Arab territory, culminating with the attack on the Qalqilyah police station in the autumn of 1956.\nLeading up to the Suez War, the missions Sharon took part in included:\nDuring a payback operation in the Deir al-Balah refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, Sharon was again wounded by gunfire, this time in the leg. Incidents such as those involving Meir Har-Zion, along with many others, contributed to the tension between Prime Minister Moshe Sharett, who often opposed Sharon's raids, and Moshe Dayan, who had become increasingly ambivalent in his feelings towards Sharon. Later in the year, Sharon was investigated and tried by the Military Police for disciplining one of his subordinates. However, the charges were dismissed before the onset of the Suez War.\n1956 Suez War.\nSharon commanded Unit 202 (the Paratroopers Brigade) during the 1956 Suez War (the British \"Operation Musketeer\"), leading the troop to take the ground east of the Sinai's Mitla Pass and eventually the pass itself against the advice of superiors, suffering heavy Israeli casualties in the process. Having successfully carried out the first part of his mission (joining a battalion parachuted near Mitla with the rest of the brigade moving on ground), Sharon's unit was deployed near the pass. Neither reconnaissance aircraft nor scouts reported enemy forces inside the Mitla Pass. Sharon, whose forces were initially heading east, away from the pass, reported to his superiors that he was increasingly concerned with the possibility of an enemy thrust through the pass, which could attack his brigade from the flank or the rear.\nSharon asked for permission to attack the pass several times, but his requests were denied, though he was allowed to check its status so that if the pass was empty, he could receive permission to take it later. Sharon sent a small scout force, which was met with heavy fire and became bogged down due to vehicle malfunction in the middle of the pass. Sharon ordered the rest of his troops to attack in order to aid their comrades. Sharon was criticized by his superiors and was damaged by allegations several years later made by several former subordinates, who claimed that Sharon tried to provoke the Egyptians and sent out the scouts in bad faith, ensuring that a battle would ensue.\nSharon had assaulted Themed in a dawn attack, and had stormed the town with his armor through the Themed Gap. Sharon routed the Sudanese police company, and captured the settlement. On his way to the Nakla, Sharon's men came under attack from Egyptian MIG-15s. On the 30th, Sharon linked up with Eytan near Nakla. Dayan had no more plans for further advances beyond the passes, but Sharon nonetheless decided to attack the Egyptian positions at Jebel Heitan. Sharon sent his lightly armed paratroopers against dug-in Egyptians supported by aircraft, tanks and heavy artillery. Sharon's actions were in response to reports of the arrival of the 1st and 2nd Brigades of the 4th Egyptian Armored Division in the area, which Sharon believed would annihilate his forces if he did not seize the high ground. Sharon sent two infantry companies, a mortar battery and some AMX-13 tanks under the command of Mordechai Gur into the Heitan Defile on the afternoon of 31 October 1956. The Egyptian forces occupied strong defensive positions and brought down heavy anti-tank, mortar and machine gun fire on the IDF force. Gur's men were forced to retreat into the \"Saucer\", where they were surrounded and came under heavy fire. Hearing of this, Sharon sent in another task force while Gur's men used the cover of night to scale the walls of the Heitan Defile. During the ensuing action, the Egyptians were defeated and forced to retreat. A total of 260 Egyptian and 38 Israeli soldiers were killed during the battle at Mitla. Due to these deaths, Sharon's actions at Mitla were surrounded in controversy, with many within the IDF viewing the deaths as the result of unnecessary and unauthorized aggression.\nSix-Day War, War of Attrition and Yom Kippur War.\nThe Mitla incident hindered Sharon's military career for several years. In the meantime, he occupied the position of an infantry brigade commander and received a law degree from Tel Aviv University. However, when Yitzhak Rabin became Chief of Staff in 1964, Sharon again began to rise rapidly in the ranks, occupying the positions of Infantry School Commander and Head of Army Training Branch, eventually achieving the rank of Aluf (Major General).\nIn the Six-Day War, Sharon, in command of an armored division on the Sinai front, drew up his own complex offensive strategy that combined infantry troops, tanks and paratroopers from planes and helicopters to destroy the Egyptian forces Sharon's 38th Division faced when it broke through to the Kusseima-Abu-Ageila fortified area. Sharon's victories and offensive strategy in the Battle of Abu-Ageila led to international commendation by military strategists; he was judged to have inaugurated a new paradigm in operational command. Researchers at the United States Army Training and Doctrine Command studied Sharon's operational planning, concluding that it involved a number of unique innovations. It was a simultaneous attack by a multiplicity of small forces, each with a specific aim, attacking a particular unit in a synergistic Egyptian defense network. As a result, instead of supporting and covering each other as they were designed to do, each Egyptian unit was left fighting for its own life.\nAccording to Sapir Handelman, after Sharon's assault of the Sinai in the Six-Day War and his encirclement of the Egyptian Third Army in the Yom Kippur War, the Israeli public nicknamed him \"The King of Israel\".\nSharon played a key role in the War of Attrition. In 1969, he was appointed the Head of IDF's Southern Command. As leader of the southern command, on 29 July Israeli frogmen stormed and destroyed Green Island, a fortress at the northern end of the Gulf of Suez whose radar and antiaircraft installations controlled that sector's airspace. On 9 September Sharon's forces carried out Operation Raviv, a large-scale raid along the western shore of the Gulf of Suez. Landing craft ferried across Russian-made tanks and armored personnel carriers that Israel had captured in 1967, and the small column harried the Egyptians for ten hours.\nFollowing his appointment to the southern command, Sharon had no further promotions, and considered retiring. Sharon discussed the issue with Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, who strongly advised him to remain at his post. Sharon remained in the military for another three years, before retiring in August 1973. Soon after, he helped found the Likud (\"Unity\") political party.\nAt the start of the Yom Kippur War on 6 October 1973, Sharon was called back to active duty along with his assigned reserve armored division. On his farm, before he left for the front line, the Reserve Commander, Zeev Amit, said to him, \"How are we going to get out of this?\" Sharon replied, \"You don't know? We will cross the Suez Canal and the war will end over there.\" Sharon arrived at the front, to participate in his fourth war, in a civilian car. His forces did not engage the Egyptian Army immediately, despite his requests. Under cover of darkness, Sharon's forces moved to a point on the Suez Canal that had been prepared before the war. In a move that again thwarted the commands of his superiors, Sharon's division crossed the Suez, effectively winning the war for Israel. He then headed north towards Ismailia, intent on cutting the Egyptian second army's supply lines, but his division was halted south of the Fresh Water Canal.\nAbraham Adan's division passed over the bridgehead into Africa, advancing to within 101 kilometers of Cairo. His division managed to encircle Suez, cutting off and encircling the Third Army. Tensions between the two generals followed Sharon's decision, but a military tribunal later found his action was militarily effective.\nSharon's complex ground maneuver is regarded as a decisive move in the Yom Kippur War, undermining the Egyptian Second Army and encircling the Egyptian Third Army. This move was regarded by many Israelis as the turning point of the war in the Sinai front. Thus, Sharon is widely viewed as the hero of the Yom Kippur War, responsible for Israel's ground victory in the Sinai in 1973. A photo of Sharon wearing a head bandage on the Suez Canal became a famous symbol of Israeli military prowess.\nSharon's political positions were controversial, and he was relieved of duty in February 1974.\nBar Lev Line.\nFollowing Israel's victory in the six-day war, the war of attrition at the Suez Canal began. The Egyptians began firing in provocation against the Israeli forces posted on the eastern part of the canal. Haim Bar Lev, Israel's chief of staff, suggested that Israel construct a border line to protect its southern border. A wall of sand and earth raised along almost the entire length of the Suez Canal would both allow observation of Egyptian forces and conceal the movements of Israeli troops on the eastern side. This line, named after the chief of staff Haim Bar Lev, became known as the Bar Lev Line. It included at least thirty strong points stretching over almost 200 kilometers.\nBar Lev suggested that such a line would defend against any major Egyptian assault across the canal, and was expected to function as a \"graveyard for Egyptian troops\". Moshe Dayan described it as \"one of the best anti-tank ditches in the world.\" Sharon, and Israel Tal on the other hand, vigorously opposed the line. Sharon said that it would pin down large military formations that would be sitting ducks for deadly artillery attacks, and cited the opinion of Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, who explained him \"the great military disaster such a line could bring.\" Notwithstanding, it was completed in spring 1970.\nDuring the Yom Kippur War, Egyptian forces successfully breached the Bar Lev Line in less than two hours at a cost of more than a thousand dead and some 5,000 wounded. Sharon would later recall that what Schneerson had told him was a tragedy, \"but unfortunately, that happened.\"\nEarly political career, 1974\u20132001.\nBeginnings of political career.\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, Sharon seemed to be personally devoted to the ideals of Mapai, the predecessor of the modern Labor Party. However, after retiring from military service, he joined the Liberal Party and was instrumental in establishing Likud in July 1973 by a merger of Herut, the Liberal Party and independent elements. Sharon became chairman of the campaign staff for that year's elections, which were scheduled for November. Two and a half weeks after the start of the election campaign, the Yom Kippur War erupted and Sharon was called back to reserve service. On the heels of being hailed as a war hero for crossing the Suez in the 1973 war, Sharon won a seat to the Knesset in the elections that year, but resigned a year later.\nFrom June 1975 to March 1976, Sharon was a special aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. He planned his return to politics for the 1977 elections; first, he tried to return to the Likud and replace Menachem Begin at the head of the party. He suggested to Simha Erlich, who headed the Liberal Party bloc in the Likud, that he was more able than Begin to win an election victory; he was rejected, however. He then tried to join the Labor Party and the centrist Democratic Movement for Change, but was rejected by those parties too. Only then did he form his own list, Shlomtzion, which won two Knesset seats in the subsequent elections. Immediately after the elections, he merged Shlomtzion with the Likud and became Minister of Agriculture.\nWhen Sharon joined Begin's government, he had relatively little political experience. During this period, Sharon supported the Gush Emunim settlements movement and was viewed as the patron of the settlers' movement. He used his position to encourage the establishment of a network of Israeli settlements in the occupied territories to prevent the possibility of Palestinian Arabs' return to these territories. Sharon doubled the number of Jewish settlements on the West Bank and Gaza Strip during his tenure.\nAfter the 1981 elections, Begin rewarded Sharon for his important contribution to Likud's narrow win, by appointing him Minister of Defense.\nUnder Sharon, Israel continued to build upon the unprecedented coordination between the Israel Defense Forces and the South African Defence Force, with Israeli and South African generals giving each other unfettered access to each other's battlefields and military tactics, and Israel sharing with South Africa highly classified information about its missions, such as Operation Opera, which had previously only been reserved for the United States. In 1981, after visiting South African forces fighting in Namibia for 10 days, Sharon argued that South Africa needed more weapons to fight Soviet infiltration in the region. Sharon promised that the relationship between Israel and South Africa would continue to deepen as they work to \"ensure the National Defense of both our countries\". The collaboration in carrying out joint-nuclear tests, in planning counter-insurgency strategies in Namibia and in designing security fences helped to make Israel, South Africa's closest ally in this period.\n1982 Lebanon War and Sabra and Shatila massacre.\nAs Defense Minister, Sharon launched an invasion of Lebanon called Operation Peace for Galilee, later known as the 1982 Lebanon War, following the shooting of Israel's ambassador in London, Shlomo Argov. Although this attempted assassination was in fact perpetrated by the Abu Nidal Organization, possibly with Syrian or Iraqi involvement, the Israeli government justified the invasion by citing 270 terrorist attacks by the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) in Israel, the occupied territories, and the Jordanian and Lebanese border (in addition to 20 attacks on Israeli interests abroad). Sharon intended the operation to eradicate the PLO from its state within a state inside Lebanon, but the war is primarily remembered for the Sabra and Shatila massacre. In a three-day massacre between 16 and 18 September, between 460 and 3,500 civilians, mostly Palestinians and Lebanese Shiites, in the Sabra neighborhood and the adjacent Shatila refugee camp were killed by the Phalanges\u2014 Lebanese Maronite Christian militias. Shatila had previously been one of the PLO's three main training camps for foreign terrorists and the main training camp for European terrorists; the Israelis maintained that 2,000 to 3,000 terrorists remained in the camps, but were unwilling to risk the lives of more of their soldiers after the Lebanese army repeatedly refused to \"clear them out.\" The killings followed years of sectarian civil war in Lebanon that left 95,000 dead. The Lebanese army's chief prosecutor investigated the killings and counted 460 dead, Israeli intelligence estimated 700\u2013800 dead, and the Palestinian Red Crescent claimed 2,000 dead. 1,200 death certificates were issued to anyone who produced three witnesses claiming a family member disappeared during the time of the massacre. Nearly all of the victims were men.\nThe Phalange militia went into the camps to clear out PLO fighters while Israeli forces surrounded the camps, blocking camp exits and providing logistical support. The killings led some to label Sharon \"the Butcher of Beirut\".\nAn Associated Press report on 15 September 1982 stated, \"Defence Minister Ariel Sharon, in a statement, tied the killing of the Phalangist leader Bachir Gemayel to the PLO, saying 'it symbolises the terrorist murderousness of the PLO terrorist organisations and their supporters'.\" Habib Chartouni, a Lebanese Christian from the Syrian Socialist National Party confessed to the murder of Gemayel, and no Palestinians were involved.\nRobert Maroun Hatem, Hobeika's bodyguard, stated in his book \"From Israel to Damascus\" that Phalangist commander Elie Hobeika ordered the massacre of civilians in defiance of Israeli instructions to behave like a \"dignified\" army. Hatem claimed \"Sharon had given strict orders to Hobeika...to guard against any desperate move\" and that Hobeika perpetrated the massacre \"to tarnish Israel's reputation worldwide\" for the benefit of Syria. Hobeika subsequently joined the Syrian occupation government and lived as a prosperous businessman under Syrian protection; further massacres in Sabra and Shatilla occurred with Syrian support in 1985.\nThe massacre followed intense Israeli bombings of Beirut that had seen heavy civilian casualties, testing Israel's relationship with the United States in the process. America sent troops to help negotiate the PLO's exit from Lebanon, withdrawing them after negotiating a ceasefire that ostensibly protected Palestinian civilians.\nLegal findings.\nAfter 400,000 Peace Now protesters rallied in Tel Aviv to demand an official government inquiry into the massacres, the official Israeli government investigation into the massacre at Sabra and Shatila, the Kahan Commission (1982), was conducted. The inquiry found that the Israeli Defense Forces were indirectly responsible for the massacre since IDF troops held the area. The commission determined that the killings were carried out by a Phalangist unit acting on its own, but its entry was known to Israel and approved by Sharon. Prime Minister Begin was also found responsible for not exercising greater involvement and awareness in the matter of introducing the Phalangists into the camps.\nThe commission also concluded that Sharon bore personal responsibility \"for ignoring the danger of bloodshed and revenge [and] not taking appropriate measures to prevent bloodshed\". It said Sharon's negligence in protecting the civilian population of Beirut, which had come under Israeli control, amounted to a dereliction of duty of the minister. In early 1983, the commission recommended the removal of Sharon from his post as defense minister and stated:\nWe have found\u00a0... that the Minister of Defense [Ariel Sharon] bears personal responsibility. In our opinion, it is fitting that the Minister of Defense draw the appropriate personal conclusions arising out of the defects revealed with regard to the manner in which he discharged the duties of his office\u2014 and if necessary, that the Prime Minister consider whether he should exercise his authority ...\u00a0to\u00a0... remove [him] from office.\"\nSharon initially refused to resign as defense minister, and Begin refused to fire him. After a grenade was thrown into a dispersing crowd at an Israeli Peace Now march, killing Emil Grunzweig and injuring 10 others, a compromise was reached: Sharon agreed to forfeit the post of defense minister but stayed in the cabinet as a minister without portfolio.\nSharon's resignation as defense minister is listed as one of the important events of the Tenth Knesset.\nIn its 21 February 1983 issue, \"Time\" published an article implying that Sharon was directly responsible for the massacres. Sharon sued \"Time\" for libel in American and Israeli courts. Although the jury concluded that the \"Time\" article included false allegations, they found that the magazine had not acted with actual malice and so was not guilty of libel.\nOn 18 June 2001, relatives of the victims of the Sabra massacre began proceedings in Belgium to have Sharon indicted on alleged war crimes charges. Elie Hobeika, the leader of the Phalange militia who carried out the massacres, was assassinated in January 2002, several months before he was scheduled to testify trial. Prior to his assassination, he had \"specifically stated that he did not plan to identify Sharon as being responsible for Sabra and Shatila.\"\nPolitical downturn and recovery.\nAfter his dismissal from the Defense Ministry post, Sharon remained in successive governments as a minister without portfolio (1983\u20131984), Minister for Trade and Industry (1984\u20131990), and Minister of Housing Construction (1990\u20131992). In the Knesset, he was member of the Foreign Affairs and Defense committee (1990\u20131992) and Chairman of the committee overseeing Jewish immigration from the Soviet Union. During this period he was a rival to then prime minister Yitzhak Shamir, but failed in various bids to replace him as chairman of Likud. Their rivalry reached a head in February 1990, when Sharon grabbed the microphone from Shamir, who was addressing the Likud central committee, and famously exclaimed: \"Who's for wiping out terrorism?\" The incident was widely viewed as an apparent coup attempt against Shamir's leadership of the party.\nIn Benjamin Netanyahu's 1996\u20131999 government, Sharon was Minister of National Infrastructure (1996\u201398), and Foreign Minister (1998\u201399). Upon the election of the Barak Labor government, Sharon became leader of the Likud party.\nOpposition to the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia.\nAriel Sharon criticised the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia in 1999 as an act of \"brutal interventionism\". Sharon said both Serbia and Kosovo have been victims of violence. He said prior to the current Yugoslav campaign against Kosovo Albanians, Serbians were the targets of attacks in the Kosovo province. \"Israel has a clear policy. We are against aggressive actions. We are against hurting innocent people. I hope that the sides will return to the negotiating table as soon as possible.\" During the crisis, Elyakim Haetzni said the Serbs should be the first to receive Israeli aid. \"There are our traditional friends,\" he told Israel Radio.\" It was suggested that Sharon may have supported the Yugoslav position because of the Serbian population's history of saving Jews during the holocaust. On Sharon's death, Serbian minister Aleksandar Vulin stated: The Serbian people will remember Sharon for opposing the 1999 NATO bombing campaign against the former Yugoslavia and advocating respect for sovereignty of other nations and a policy of not interfering with their internal affairs.\nCampaign for Prime Minister, 2000\u20132001.\nOn 28 September 2000, Sharon and an escort of over 1,000 Israeli police officers visited the Temple Mount complex, site of the Dome of the Rock and al-Aqsa Mosque, the holiest place in the world to Jews and the third holiest site in Islam. Sharon declared that the complex would remain under perpetual Israeli control. Palestinian commentators accused Sharon of purposely inflaming emotions with the event to provoke a violent response and obstruct success of delicate ongoing peace talks. On the following day, a large number of Palestinian demonstrators and an Israeli police contingent confronted each other at the site. According to the U.S. State Department, \"Palestinians held large demonstrations and threw stones at police in the vicinity of the Western Wall. Police used rubber-coated metal bullets and live ammunition to disperse the demonstrators, killing 4 persons and injuring about 200.\" According to the government of Israel, 14 policemen were injured.\nSharon's visit, a few months before his election as Prime Minister, came after archeologists claimed that extensive building operations at the site were destroying priceless antiquities. Sharon's supporters claim that Yasser Arafat and the Palestinian National Authority planned the Second Intifada months prior to Sharon's visit. They state that Palestinian security chief Jabril Rajoub provided assurances that if Sharon did not enter the mosques, no problems would arise. They also often quote statements by Palestinian Authority officials, particularly Imad Falouji, the P.A. Communications Minister, who admitted months after Sharon's visit that the violence had been planned in July, far in advance of Sharon's visit, stating the intifada \"was carefully planned since the return of (Palestinian President) Yasser Arafat from Camp David negotiations rejecting the U.S. conditions\". According to the Mitchell Report,\nthe government of Israel asserted that the immediate catalyst for the violence was the breakdown of the Camp David negotiations on 25 July 2000 and the \"widespread appreciation in the international community of Palestinian responsibility for the impasse.\" In this view, Palestinian violence was planned by the PA leadership, and was aimed at \"provoking and incurring Palestinian casualties as a means of regaining the diplomatic initiative.\"\nThe Mitchell Report found that\nthe Sharon visit did not cause the Al-Aqsa Intifada. But it was poorly timed and the provocative effect should have been foreseen; indeed, it was foreseen by those who urged that the visit be prohibited. More significant were the events that followed: The decision of the Israeli police on 29 September to use lethal means against the Palestinian demonstrators.\nIn addition, the report stated,\nAccordingly, we have no basis on which to conclude that there was a deliberate plan by the PA [Palestinian Authority] to initiate a campaign of violence at the first opportunity; or to conclude that there was a deliberate plan by the GOI [Government of Israel] to respond with lethal force.\nThe Or Commission, an Israeli panel of inquiry appointed to investigate the October 2000 events,\ncriticised the Israeli police for being unprepared for the riots and possibly using excessive force to disperse the mobs, resulting in the deaths of 12 Arab Israeli, one Jewish and one Palestinian citizens.\nPrime Minister (2001\u20132006).\nAfter the collapse of Barak's government, Sharon was elected Prime Minister on 6 February 2001, defeating Barak 62 percent to 38 percent. Sharon's senior adviser was Raanan Gissin. In his first act as prime minister, Sharon invited the Labor Party to join in a coalition with Likud. After Israel was struck by a wave of suicide bombings in 2002, Sharon decided to launch Operation Defensive Shield and began the construction of a barrier around the West Bank. A survey conducted by Tel Aviv University's Jaffe Center in May 2004 found that 80% of Jewish Israelis believed that the Israel Defense Forces had succeeded in militarily countering the Al-Aqsa Intifada.\nThe election of the more pro-Russian Sharon, as well as the more pro-Israel Vladimir Putin, led to an improvement in Israel\u2013Russia relations.\nIn September 2003, Sharon became the first prime minister of Israel to visit India, saying that Israel regarded India as one of the most important countries in the world. Some analysts speculated on the development of a three-way military axis of New Delhi, Washington, D.C., and Jerusalem.\nOn 20 July 2004, Sharon called on French Jews to emigrate from France to Israel immediately, in light of an increase in antisemitism in France (94 antisemitic assaults were reported in the first six months of 2004, compared to 47 in 2003). France has the third-largest Jewish population in the world (about 600,000 people). Sharon observed that an \"unfettered anti-Semitism\" reigned in France. The French government responded by describing his comments as \"unacceptable\", as did the French representative Jewish organization CRIF, which denied Sharon's claim of intense anti-Semitism in French society. An Israeli spokesperson later claimed that Sharon had been misunderstood. France then postponed a visit by Sharon. Upon his visit, both Sharon and French President Jacques Chirac were described as showing a willingness to put the issue behind them.\nUnilateral disengagement.\nIn September 2001, Sharon stated for the first time that Palestinians should have the right to establish their own land west of the Jordan River. In May 2003, Sharon endorsed the Road Map for Peace put forth by the United States, the European Union and Russia, which opened a dialogue with Mahmud Abbas, and stated his commitment to the creation of a Palestinian state in the future.\nHe embarked on a course of unilateral withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, while maintaining control of its coastline and airspace. Sharon's plan was welcomed by both the Palestinian Authority and Israel's left wing as a step towards a final peace settlement. However, it was greeted with opposition from within his own Likud party and from other right wing Israelis, on national security, military, and religious grounds.\nDisengagement from Gaza.\nOn 1 December 2004, Sharon dismissed five ministers from the Shinui party for voting against the government's 2005 budget. In January 2005, Sharon formed a national unity government that included representatives of Likud, Labor, and Meimad and Degel HaTorah as \"out-of-government\" supporters without any seats in the government (United Torah Judaism parties usually reject having ministerial offices as a policy). Between 16 and 30 August 2005, Sharon controversially expelled 9,480 Jewish settlers from 21 settlements in Gaza and four settlements in the northern West Bank. Once it became clear that the evictions were definitely going ahead, a group of conservative Rabbis, led by Yosef Dayan, placed an ancient curse on Sharon known as the Pulsa diNura, calling on the Angel of Death to intervene and kill him. After Israeli soldiers bulldozed every settlement structure except for several former synagogues, Israeli soldiers formally left Gaza on 11 September 2005 and closed the border fence at Kissufim. While his decision to withdraw from Gaza sparked bitter protests from members of the Likud party and the settler movement, opinion polls showed that it was a popular move among most of the Israeli electorate, with more than 80 percent of Israelis backing the plans. On 27 September 2005, Sharon narrowly defeated a leadership challenge by a 52\u201348 percent vote. The move was initiated within the central committee of the governing Likud party by Sharon's main rival, Benjamin Netanyahu, who had left the cabinet to protest Sharon's withdrawal from Gaza. The measure was an attempt by Netanyahu to call an early primary in November 2005 to choose the party's leader.\nFounding of Kadima.\nOn 21 November 2005, Sharon resigned as head of Likud, and dissolved parliament to form a new centrist party called Kadima (\"Forward\"). November polls indicated that Sharon was likely to be returned to the prime ministership. On 20 December 2005, Sharon's longtime rival Netanyahu was elected his successor as leader of Likud. Following Sharon's incapacitation, Ehud Olmert replaced Sharon as Kadima's leader, for the nearing general elections. Likud, along with the Labor Party, were \"Kadima\"s chief rivals in the March 2006 elections.\nSharon's stroke occurred a few months before he had been expected to win a new election and was widely interpreted as planning on \"clearing Israel out of most of the West Bank\", in a series of unilateral withdrawals.\nIn the elections, which saw Israel's lowest-ever voter turnout of 64 percent (the number usually averages on the high 70%), Kadima, headed by Olmert, received the most Knesset seats, followed by Labor. The new governing coalition installed in May 2006 included Kadima, with Olmert as Prime Minister, Labor (including Amir Peretz as Defense Minister), the Pensioners' Party (Gil), the Shas religious party, and Israel Beytenu.\nAlleged fundraising irregularities and Greek island affair.\nDuring the latter part of his career, Sharon was investigated for alleged involvement in a number of financial scandals, in particular, the Greek Island Affair and irregularities of fundraising during the 1999 election campaign. In the Greek Island Affair, Sharon was accused of promising (during his term as Foreign Minister) to help Israeli businessman David Appel in his development project on a Greek island in exchange for large consultancy payments to Sharon's son Gilad. The charges were later dropped due to lack of evidence. In the 1999 election fundraising scandal, Sharon was not charged with any wrongdoing, but his son Omri, a Knesset member at the time, was charged and sentenced in 2006 to nine months in prison.\nTo avoid a potential conflict of interest in relation to these investigations, Sharon was not involved in the confirmation of the appointment of a new attorney general, Menahem Mazuz, in 2005.\nOn 10 December 2005, Israeli police raided Martin Schlaff's apartment in Jerusalem. Another suspect in the case was Robert Nowikovsky, an Austrian involved in Russian state-owned company Gazprom's business activities in Europe.\nAccording to \"Haaretz\", \"The $3\u00a0million that parachuted into Gilad and Omri Sharon's bank account toward the end of 2002 was transferred there in the context of a consultancy contract for development of kolkhozes (collective farms) in Russia. Gilad Sharon was brought into the campaign to make the wilderness bloom in Russia by Getex, a large Russian-based exporter of seeds (peas, millet, wheat) from Eastern Europe. Getex also has ties with Israeli firms involved in exporting wheat from Ukraine, for example. The company owns farms in Eastern Europe and is considered large and prominent in its field. It has its Vienna offices in the same building as Jurimex, which was behind the $1-million guarantee to the Yisrael Beiteinu party.\"\nOn 17 December, police found evidence of a $3\u00a0million bribe paid to Sharon's sons. Shortly afterwards, Sharon suffered a stroke.\nIllness, incapacitation and death (2006\u201314).\nSharon suffered from obesity from the 1980s and also had suspected chronic high blood pressure and high cholesterol \u2013 at tall, he was reputed to weigh . Stories of Sharon's appetite and obesity were legendary in Israel. He would often joke about his love of food and expansive girth. His staff car would reportedly be stocked with snacks, vodka, and caviar. In October 2004 when asked why he did not wear a bulletproof vest despite frequent death threats, Sharon smiled and replied, \"There is none that fits my size\". He was a daily consumer of cigars and luxury foods. Numerous attempts by doctors, friends, and staff to impose a balanced diet on Sharon were unsuccessful.\nSharon was hospitalized on 18 December 2005, after suffering a minor ischemic stroke. During his hospital stay, doctors discovered a heart defect requiring surgery and ordered bed rest pending a cardiac catheterization scheduled for 5 January 2006. Instead, Sharon immediately returned to work and suffered a hemorrhagic stroke on 4 January, the day before surgery. He was rushed to Hadassah Medical Center in Jerusalem. After two surgeries lasting 7 and 14 hours, doctors stopped the bleeding in Sharon's brain, but were unable to prevent him from entering into a coma. Subsequent media reports indicated that Sharon had been diagnosed with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) during his December hospitalisation. Hadassah Hospital Director Shlomo Mor-Yosef declined to respond to comments that the combination of CAA and blood thinners after Sharon's December stroke might have caused his more serious subsequent stroke.\nEhud Olmert became Acting Prime Minister the night of Sharon's second stroke, while Sharon officially remained in office. Knesset elections followed in March, with Olmert and Sharon's Kadima party winning a plurality. The next month, the Israeli Cabinet declared Sharon permanently incapacitated and Olmert became Interim Prime Minister on 14 April 2006 and Prime Minister in his own right on 4 May.\nSharon underwent a series of subsequent surgeries related to his state. In May 2006, he was transferred to a long-term care facility in Sheba Medical Center. In July of that year, he was briefly taken to the hospital's intensive care unit to be treated for bacteria in his blood, before returning to the long-term care facility on 6 November 2006. Sharon would remain at Sheba Medical Center until his death. Medical experts indicated that his cognitive abilities had likely been destroyed by the stroke. His condition worsened from late 2013, and Sharon suffered from renal failure on 1 January 2014.\nAfter spending eight years in a coma, Sharon died at 14:00 local time (12:00 UTC) on 11 January 2014. Sharon's state funeral was held on 13 January in accordance with Jewish burial customs, which require that interment takes place as soon after death as possible. His body lay in state in the Knesset Plaza from 12 January until the official ceremony, followed by a funeral held at the family's ranch in the Negev Desert. Sharon was buried beside his wife, Lily.\nPersonal life.\nSharon was married twice, to two sisters, Margalit and Lily Zimmerman, who were from Romania. Sharon met Margalit in 1947 when she was 16, while she was tending a vegetable field, and married her in 1953, shortly after becoming a military instructor. Margalit was a supervisory psychiatric nurse. They had one son, Gur. Margalit died in a car accident in May 1962 and Gur died in October 1967, aged 11, after a friend accidentally shot him while the two children were playing with a rifle at the Sharon family home. After Margalit's death, Sharon married her younger sister, Lily. They had two sons, Omri and Gilad, and six grandchildren. Lily Sharon died of lung cancer in 2000.\nSharon's sister, Yehudit (Dita) married Dr. Shmuel Mandel. In the 1950s, the couple permanently left Israel and emigrated to the United States. This caused a permanent rift in the family. Shmuel and Vera Scheinerman were greatly hurt by their daughter's choice to leave Israel. As a result, Vera Scheinerman willed only a small part of her estate to Dita, an act which enraged her. At one point, Dita decided to return to Israel, but after Vera was informed by the Israel Lands Administration that it would not be legally possible to split the family property between Ariel and Dita, and informed her that she would not be able to build a home there, Dita, believing she was being lied to, permanently cut her family in Israel off, and refused to attend the funerals of her mother and sister-in-law. She reestablished contact after Sharon's stroke. Sharon's sister has rarely been mentioned in biographies of him: he himself rarely acknowledged her and only mentioned her twice in his autobiography.\nRecognition.\nThe Ariel Sharon Park, an environmental park near Tel Aviv three times the size of New York's Central Park which has a 50,000-seat amphitheatre, is named for him.\nIn the Negev desert, the IDF is currently building its city of training bases, Camp Ariel Sharon. In total, a NIS 50\u00a0billion project, the city of bases is named after Ariel Sharon, the largest active construction project in Israel, it is to become the largest IDF base in Israel."}
{"id": "2945", "revid": "14414975", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2945", "title": "Romantic orientation", "text": "Romantic orientation, also called affectional orientation, indicates the sex or gender with which a person is most likely to have a romantic relationship or fall in love. It is used both alternatively and side by side with the term \"sexual orientation\", and is based on the perspective that sexual attraction is but a single component of a larger dynamic. For example, although a pansexual person may feel sexually attracted to people regardless of gender, the person may experience romantic attraction and intimacy with women only.\nFor asexual people, romantic orientation is often considered a more useful measure of attraction than sexual orientation.\nThe relationship between sexual attraction and romantic attraction is still under debate and is not fully understood. Sexual and romantic attractions are often studied in conjunction. Even though studies of sexual and romantic spectrums are shedding light onto this underresearched subject, much is still not fully understood.\nRomantic identities.\nPeople may or may not engage in purely emotional romantic relationships. The main identities relating to this are:\nRelationship with sexual orientation and asexuality.\nThe implications of the distinction between romantic and sexual orientations have not been fully recognized, nor have they been studied extensively. It is common for sources to describe sexual orientation as including components of both sexual and romantic (or romantic equivalent) attractions. Publications investigating the relationship between sexual orientation and romantic orientation are limited. Challenges in collecting information result from survey participants having difficulty identifying or distinguishing between sexual and romantic attractions. Asexual individuals experience little to no sexual attraction (see gray asexuality); however, they may still experience romantic attraction. Lisa M. Diamond states that a person's romantic orientation can differ from whom the person is sexually attracted to. While there is limited research on the discordance between sexual attraction and romantic attraction in individuals, also known as cross orientation, the possibility of fluidity and diversity in attractions have been progressively recognized. Researchers Bulmer and Izuma found that people who identify as aromantic often have more negative attitudes in relation to romance. While roughly 1% of the population identifies as asexual, 74% of those peoples reported having some form of romantic attraction. The Japanese LGBT and asexual organization, the SRGM \nFederation, has declared that, \"the confusion between sexual orientation and romance orientation is a violation of human rights.\"\nAromanticism.\nOne of the attributes of aromantic people is that, despite feeling no romantic attraction, they may still enjoy sex. Aromantic people are not necessarily incapable of feeling love. For example, they may still feel familial love, or the type of platonic love that is expressed between friends. Individuals who identify as aromantic may have trouble distinguishing the affection of family and friends from that of a romantic partner.\nMany aromantic people are asexual, but the term \"aromantic\" can be used in relation to various sexual identities, such as aromantic bisexual, aromantic heterosexual, aromantic lesbian, aromantic gay man or aromantic asexual. This is because aromanticism primarily deals with romantic attraction rather than with sexuality or libido.\nSome publications have argued that there is an underrepresentation of asexual and aromantic people in media and in research, and that they are often misunderstood. Aromantic people often face stigma and are stereotyped with labels such as being afraid of intimacy, heartless, or deluded. Amatonormativity, a concept that elevates romantic relationships over non-romantic relationships, has been said to be damaging to aromantics.\nThe antonym of aromanticism is alloromanticism, the state of experiencing romantic love or romantic attraction to others, while such a person is called an alloromantic. An informal term for an aromantic person is \"aro\". In the expanded LGBT initialism \"LGBTQIA+\", the letter \"A\" stands for asexual, aromantic and agender."}
{"id": "2947", "revid": "1018023501", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2947", "title": "Anoa", "text": "Anoa, also known as dwarf buffalo and sapiutan, are a subgenus of \"Bubalus\" comprising two species endemic to the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia: the mountain anoa (\"Bubalus quarlesi\") and the lowland anoa (\"Bubalus depressicornis\"). Both live in undisturbed rainforest and are similar in appearance to miniature water buffalo, weighing .\nBoth species of anoa have been classified as endangered since the 1960s and the populations continue to decrease. Fewer than 5,000 animals of each species likely remain. Reasons for their decline include hunting for hides, horns and meat by the local peoples and loss of habitat due to the advancement of settlement. Currently, hunting is the more serious factor in most areas.\nAnoa are most closely allied to the larger Asian buffaloes, showing the same reversal of the direction of the hair on their backs. The horns are peculiar for their upright direction and comparative straightness, although they have the same triangular section as in other buffaloes. White spots are sometimes present below the eyes and there may be white markings on the legs and back; the absence or presence of these white markings may be indicative of distinct races. The horns of the cows are very small. The nearest allies of the anoa appear to be certain extinct Asian buffaloes, the remains of which have been found in the Siwalik Hills of northern India.\nBoth are found on the island of Sulawesi and the nearby island of Buton in Indonesia. They apparently live singly or in pairs, rather than in herds like most cattle, except when the cows are about to give birth. Little is known about their life history as well. However, in captive individuals they have a life expectancy of 20\u201330 years. The anoa take two to three years before they reach sexual maturity and have one calf a year and have very rarely been seen to have more.\nSkulls of anoa cannot be accurately identified as to species, and there is likely hybridizing and interbreeding between the two in the zoo population. It is questioned as to whether the two species were actually different due to them occurring together in many different areas, as well as some interbreeding. A study of the mtDNA of ten specimens from different localities found a high mitochondrial genetic diversity between individuals identified as one or the other species, indicating support for recognition as two species.\nSpecies.\nLowland anoa.\nThe lowland anoa (\"Bubalus depressicornis\") is a small bovid, standing barely over at the shoulder. It is usually solitary, living in lowland forests, browsing on plants and understory. According to the Groves (1969) the lowland anoa can be told apart from the other species by being larger, having a triangular horn cross-section, sparse as opposed to thick and woolly hair, and always having white marking on the face and legs.\nMountain anoa.\nThe mountain anoa (\"Bubalus quarlesi\") is also known as Quarle's anoa and \"anoa pegunungan\". Standing at at the shoulder, it is even smaller than the lowland anoa and the smallest of all living wild cattle. They also have longer, woolier hair that moults every year, showing faint spots on the head, neck and limbs. According to the Groves (1969) the mountain anoa can be told apart from the other species by being smaller, having a round horn cross-section, thick and woolly hair, and sometimes having white marking on the face and legs.\nDistribution.\nBoth the lowland anoa (\"Bubalus depressicornis\") and the mountain anoa (\"Bubalus quarlesi\") are endemic to the islands of Sulawesi in Indonesia. Both species appear to occur in exactly the same areas. Sulawesi is a unique area due to the fact that roughly 61% of the species found there are endemic species, including the anoa.\nHabitat.\nTraditionally, a key difference between the two species is the altitude at which they occur. The mountain anoa would be found at higher elevations than its lowland counterpart and is found in the forests. The lowland anoa was said to spend its time in the lower elevation areas and is also found in forests. Since 2005, however, these differences do not seem to be accurate, both species occur in the same areas in the same habitats.\nMorphology.\nThe anoa have many physical characteristics of bovine relatives and are considered to be most closely related to the water buffalo, which was confirmed through DNA analysis.\nThe physical characteristics of the two species are similar. The anoa is the smallest of the wild cattle species. When anoa are born, they have a set of thick, woolly fur that comes in many color variations ranging from yellow to brown. In adults, the fur is typically brown or black and males tend to have darker variations. Hair thickness varies slightly between the two species based on elevation and distribution. In both species of anoa, horns are present on both males and females and are typically straight protuberances. Another defining characteristic of the anoa is an extremely thick hide underneath the thick fur.\nConservation.\nThe anoa are endemic to the island of Sulawesi and are currently experiencing large declines in their populations. Knowledge of their decline has only recently been documented, however, and the villages and villagers lack the knowledge of how to help maintain or increase populations.\nThe leading cause of their population decline is hunting by local villagers for meat, with habitat loss also being significant. One benefit of the lack of knowledge about the legal status of what they are doing is that villagers are open to communication with researchers on their harvests and hunting practices; where awareness of conservation issues has penetrated, villagers will lie about their activities.\nLogging is a large issue due to the fact that both species prefer core forested habitat that is far away from humans and the influences that come with them. By logging, humans create much more fragmented habitat and, therefore, a decrease in the area where the anoa can breed and live. This habitat fragmentation also alters the natural mixing of populations of the anoa. This may lead to a loss in genetic diversity between the two species and, over time, could also lead to their decline.\nExternal links.\nDIET COMPOSITION OF ANOA (\"Bubalus\" sp.)

{"id": "2948", "revid": "29738728", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2948", "title": "Agner Krarup Erlang", "text": "Agner Krarup Erlang (1 January 1878 \u2013 3 February 1929) was a Danish mathematician, statistician and engineer, who invented the fields of traffic engineering and queueing theory.\nBy the time of his relatively early death at the age of 51, Erlang had created the field of telephone networks analysis. His early work in scrutinizing the use of local, exchange and trunk telephone line usage in a small community to understand the theoretical requirements of an efficient network led to the creation of the Erlang formula, which became a foundational element of modern telecommunication network studies.\nLife.\nErlang was born at L\u00f8nborg, near Tarm, in Jutland. He was the son of a schoolmaster, and a descendant of Thomas Fincke on his mother's side. At age 14, he passed the Preliminary Examination of the University of Copenhagen with distinction, after receiving dispensation to take it because he was younger than the usual minimum age. For the next two years he taught alongside his father.\nA distant relative provided free board and lodging, and Erlang prepared for and took the University of Copenhagen entrance examination in 1896, and passed with distinction. He won a scholarship to the University and majored in mathematics, and also studied astronomy, physics and chemistry. He graduated in 1901 with an MA and over the next 7 years taught at several schools. He maintained his interest in mathematics, and received an award for a paper that he submitted to the University of Copenhagen.\nHe was a member of the Danish Mathematicians' Association (DMF) and through this met amateur mathematician Johan Jensen, the Chief Engineer of the Copenhagen Telephone Company (KTAS in Danish), an offshoot of the International Bell Telephone Company. Erlang worked for the CTC (KTAS) from 1908 for almost 20 years, until his death in Copenhagen after an abdominal operation.\nHe was an associate of the British Institution of Electrical Engineers.\nContributions.\nWhile working for the CTC, Erlang was presented with the classic problem of determining how many circuits were needed to provide an acceptable telephone service. His thinking went further by finding how many telephone operators were needed to handle a given volume of calls. Most telephone exchanges then used human operators and cord boards to switch telephone calls by means of jack plugs.\nOut of necessity, Erlang was a hands-on researcher. He would conduct measurements and was prepared to climb into street manholes to do so. He was also an expert in the history and calculation of the numerical tables of mathematical functions, particularly logarithms. He devised new calculation methods for certain forms of tables.\nHe developed his theory of telephone traffic over several years. His significant publications include:\nThese and other notable papers were translated into English, French and German. His papers were prepared in a very brief style and can be difficult to understand without a background in the field. One researcher from Bell Telephone Laboratories is said to have learned Danish to study them.\nThe British Post Office accepted his formula as the basis for calculating circuit facilities.\nIn 1946, the CCITT named the international unit of telephone traffic \"the Erlang\". A statistical distribution and programming language listed below have also been named in his honour."}
{"id": "2950", "revid": "1016170593", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2950", "title": "Anyone Can Whistle", "text": "Anyone Can Whistle is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim, and a book by Arthur Laurents.\nDescribed by theater historian Ken Mandelbaum as \"a satire on conformity and the insanity of the so-called sane,\" the show tells a story of an economically-depressed town whose corrupt Mayoress, in an attempt to draw tourists, decides to create a fake \"miracle\" - which draws the attention of Fay Apple, an emotionally inhibited nurse, a crowd of inmates from a local asylum called \"The Cookie Jar,\" and a \"doctor\" with secrets of his own.\nFollowing a tryout period in Philadelphia, \"Anyone\" opened at the Majestic Theater on Broadway on April 4, 1964. The show received widely varied reviews (including negative notices from the \"New York Times\" and the \"New York Herald Tribune\"), and closed after a run of 12 previews and 9 performances.\nIn the decades since its closing, \"Anyone\" has not been produced on the scale of other Sondheim musicals; notable productions include a 1995 concert version at Carnegie Hall, a pair of stagings in London and Los Angeles in 2003 that incorporated revisions, and a 2010 concert staging for the Encores! program at New York City Center.\nHowever, its score has become acclaimed as a part of Sondheim's canon, and songs such as the title tune, \"Everybody Says Don't\", and \"There Won't Be Trumpets\" have been widely performed.\nThe show marked the stage musical debut of Angela Lansbury.\nBackground.\nThe show was first announced in \"The New York Times\" on October 5, 1961: \"For the winter of 1962, [Arthur Laurents] is nurturing another musical project, \"The Natives Are Restless\". The narrative and staging will be Mr. Laurent's handiwork; music and lyrics that of Stephen Sondheim. A meager description was furnished by Mr. Laurents, who refused to elaborate. Although the title might indicate otherwise, it is indigenous in content and contemporary in scope. No producer yet.\" No news of the show appeared until July 14, 1963, in an article in \"The New York Times\" about Kermit Bloomgarden, where it discussed the four shows he was producing for the coming season; two were maybes, two were definite. One of the latter was a Sondheim-Laurents musical (now named \"Side Show\"). In a letter to Bloomgarden, Laurents wrote, \"I beg you not to mention the money problems or any difficulties to Steve anymore. It depresses him terribly and makes it terribly difficult for him to work... It is damn hard to concentrate ... when all the atmosphere is filled with gloom and forebodings about will the show get the money to go on? ... Spare him the gory details.\" This behavior is considered unusual for Laurents, which runs contrary to his current reputation. Sondheim discovered that Laurents hated doing backers' auditions and he took over that responsibility, playing and singing more than 30. They found 115 investors to back the $350,000 production, including Richard Rodgers and Sondheim's father.\nEager to work with both Laurents and Sondheim, Angela Lansbury accepted the lead role as Mayoress Cora Hoover Hooper, despite her strong misgivings about the script and her ability to handle the score. Also signed were Lee Remick as Nurse Fay Apple and Harry Guardino as Hapgood. Laurents had wanted Barbra Streisand for the role of Fay, but she turned it down to star in \"Funny Girl\". Following rehearsals in New York City, the company started pre-Broadway tryouts in Philadelphia from March 2 to 21, 1964. Laurents, ignoring criticism about the show's message being trite and its absurdist style difficult to comprehend, poured his energies into restaging rather than dealing with the crux of the problem.\nThe show suffered further setbacks when supporting actor Henry Lascoe, who played Comptroller Schubb, suffered a heart attack during the show's out-of-town tryout, and was replaced by Gabriel Dell. According to Sondheim, \"Lansbury was so insecure onstage, and unhappy with her performance, that we considered replacing her. Ironically, it soon became apparent that it had been Lascoe, an old pro...who had made her feel like an amateur. The minute his much less confident understudy took over, she felt free to blossom, which she spectacularly did.\" Sondheim called the reviews \"humiliating\" and the audiences \"hostile.\" \nProductions.\nAfter multiple revisions, the show opened on Broadway on April 4, 1964, at the Majestic Theatre, where it closed after 9 performances and 12 previews, unable to overcome negative notices from major papers such as the \"New York Times\" and the \"New York Herald Tribune\". Scenic design was by William and Jean Eckart, costume design by Theoni V. Aldredge, and lighting design by Jules Fisher. Choreographer Herbert Ross received the show's sole Tony Award nomination.\nThe show became a cult favorite, and a truncated original cast recording released by Columbia Records sold well among Sondheim fans and musical theatre buffs. \"There Won't Be Trumpets,\" a song cut during previews, has become a favorite of cabaret performers.\nOn April 8, 1995, a staged concert was held at Carnegie Hall in New York City as a benefit for the Gay Men's Health Crisis. The concert was recorded by Columbia Records, preserving for the first time musical passages and numbers not included on the original Broadway cast recording. For example, the cut song \"There's Always A Woman\" was included at this concert. Lansbury served as narrator, with Madeline Kahn as Cora, Bernadette Peters as Fay, and Scott Bakula as Hapgood. Additional cast included Chip Zien, Ken Page, and Harvey Evans, the only original cast member to reprise his original role.\nIn 2003, Sony reissued the original Broadway cast recording on compact disc. Two revivals were staged that year, one in London, at the Bridewell Theatre, and one in Los Angeles, at the Matrix Theatre.\nThe Ravinia Festival, Highland Park, Illinois, presented a staged concert on August 26 and 27, 2005, with Audra McDonald (Fay), Michael Cerveris (Hapgood) and Patti LuPone (Cora).\nOn January 11, 2008, Talk Is Free Theatre presented the Canadian professional premiere (in concert) at the Gryphon Theatre in Barrie, Ontario, with a fundraiser performance on January 13 at the Diesel Playhouse in Toronto, Ontario. It starred Adam Brazier as Hapgood, Kate Hennig as Cora, Blythe Wilson as Fay, and Richard Ouzounian as Narrator, who also served as director. Choreography was by Sam Strasfeld. Additional cast included Juan Chioran as Comptroller Shub, Jonathan Monro as Treasurer Cooley, and Mark Harapiak as Chief Magruder. Musical direction was provided by Wayne Gwillim.\nNew York City Center Encores! presented a staged concert from April 8 through April 11, 2010, with Sutton Foster as Nurse Fay Apple, Donna Murphy as Mayoress Cora Hoover Hooper, and Raul Esparza as Hapgood, with direction and choreography by Casey Nicholaw. The production was the second most attended in \"Encores!\" history, and Stephen Sondheim was present at the post-matinee talkback on April 10.\nA London production of \"Anyone can Whistle\" opened at the Jermyn Street Studio Theatre, London, in association with Primavera Productions, running from March 10, 2010, to April 17, 2010. The director is Tom Littler, with Musical Director Tom Attwood, and a cast that includes Issy van Randwyck (Mayoress), Rosalie Craig (Nurse Fay Apple) and David Ricardo-Pearce (Hapgood).\nPorchlight Music Theatre of Chicago presented \"Anyone Can Whistle\" in 2013 as a part of \"Porchlight Revisits\" series, in which they stage three forgotten musicals per year. It was directed by Christopher Pazdernik and music directed by Aaron Benham.\nA new production directed by Phil Willmott opened at the Union Theatre in London, running from February 8 through March 11, 2017.\nPlot.\nAct 1.\nThe story is set in an imaginary American town that has gone bankrupt. (Its former major industry was the production of an unidentified product that never wore out. Everyone has one now, and no one needs a replacement.) The only place in town doing good business is the local Sanatorium, known as \u201cThe Cookie Jar,\u201d whose inmates look much healthier than the disgruntled townspeople. (\"I'm Like the Bluebird\") All the money is in the hands of Cora Hoover Hooper, the stylish, ruthless mayoress and her cronies - Comptroller Schub, Treasurer Cooley, and Police Chief Magruder. Cora appears carried in a litter by her backup singers, and admits that she can accept anything except unpopularity (\u201cMe and My Town\u201d). The scheming Comptroller Schub tells her that he has a plan to save her administration, and the town, promising \u201cIt's highly unethical.\u201d He tells her to meet him at the rock on the edge of town. At the rock, a local mother, Mrs. Schroeder, tries to tell her child, Baby Joan, to come down from the rock, when Baby Joan licks it - and a spring of water begins flowing from it. The town instantly proclaims a miracle, and Cora and her council eagerly anticipate tourist dollars as they boast of the water's curative powers. (\"Miracle Song\") It is soon revealed to Cora that the miracle is a fake, controlled by a pump inside the rock. The only person in town who doubts the miracle is Fay Apple, an eternally skeptical young nurse from the Cookie Jar who refuses to believe in miracles. She appears at the rock with all forty-nine of the inmates, or \u201cCookies\u201d in tow, intending to let them take some of the water. Schub realizes that if they drink the water and do not change, people will discover the fraud. As he tries to stop Fay, the inmates mingle with the townspeople, until no one can guess who is who. Fay disappears, and hiding from the police, admits that she hopes for one miracle - for a hero who can come and deliver the town from the madness (\u201cThere Won't Be Trumpets\u201d). Cora arrives on the scene with the Cookie Jar's manager, Dr. Detmold, but he says that Fay has taken the records to identify the inmates. He tells Cora that he is expecting a new assistant who might help them. At that moment a mysterious stranger, J. Bowden Hapgood, arrives asking for directions to the Cookie Jar. He is instantly taken for the new assistant. Asked to identify the missing Cookies, Hapgood begins questioning random people and sorting them into two groups, group A, and group one, but refuses to divulge which group is which. The town council becomes suspicious of this and tries to force the truth out, but Hapgood questions them until they begin to doubt their own sanity. Cora is too caught up with his logic to care. (\u201cSimple\u201d) As the extended musical sequence ends, the lights black out except for a spotlight on Hapgood, who announces to the audience, \u201cYou are all mad!\u201d Seconds later, the stage lights are restored. The stage set has vanished, and the cast is revealed in theater seats, holding programs, applauding the audience, as the act ends.\nAct 2.\nAs act two opens, the two groups are now in bitter rivalry over who is the normal group (\u201cA-1 March\u201d) Another stranger, a French woman in a feathered coat appears. It is really Fay Apple in disguise. She introduces herself as the Lady from Lourdes, a professional Miracle Inspector, come to investigate the miracle. As Schub runs off to warn Cora, Fay seeks out Hapgood in his hotel, and the two seduce each other in the style of a French romantic film. (\u201cCome Play Wiz Me\u201d) Fay tries to get Hapgood's help in exposing the miracle. Hapgood, however, sees through her disguise and wants to question her first. Fay refuses to take her wig off, and confesses to him that this disguise, left over from a college play, is the only way she can break out of her rigid and cynical persona. She begins to hope, however, that Hapgood may be the one who can help her learn to be free. (\u201cAnyone Can Whistle\u201d) Meanwhile, the two groups continue to march, and Cora, trying to give a speech, realizes that Hapgood has stolen her limelight. (\u201cA Parade in Town\u201d) She and Schub plan an emergency meeting at her house. Back at the hotel, Hapgood comes up with an idea, telling Fay to destroy the inmates' records. That way Fay can be free of them and they can stop pretending. When Fay is reluctant, Hapgood produces a record of his own - he is her fiftieth Cookie. He is a practicing idealist who, after years of attempted heroism, is tired of crusading and has come to the Cookie Jar to retire. Inspired by his record, Fay begins to tear the records up. As she does, the Cookies appear and begin to dance (\u201cEverybody Says Don't\u201d).\nAct 3.\nAct three begins with Cora at her house with her council. Schub has put the miracle on hiatus, but announces that they can easily turn the town against Hapgood by blaming him for it. The group celebrates their alliance. (\u201cI've Got You to Lean On\u201d) A mob quickly forms outside the hotel, and Hapgood and Fay, still disguised, take refuge under the rock. Discovering the fraud, Cora and the council confront them. At that moment, Cora receives a telegram from the governor warning that if the quota of forty-nine cookies is not filled, she will be impeached. Schub tells her that since Hapgood never said who is normal or not, they can arrest anyone at random until the quota is filled. Fay tries to get Hapgood to expose the miracle, but he warns her no one will believe it is a fake, because it works as a miracle should. Fay wants his help stopping the Mayoress, but he refuses, since he is through with crusading. Although she knows she still isn't out of her shell, Fay angrily swears to go it alone. (\u201cSee What it Gets You\u201d) As Cora and the police force begin rounding up Cookies, Fay tries to get the key away from the guards in an extended ballet sequence. (\u201cThe Cookie Chase\u201d) As it ends, Fay is captured, and Dr. Detmold suddenly recognizes her. Fay tells the townspeople about the fake miracle, but the town refuses to believe her. Detmold tells Cora that even without the records, Fay can identify the inmates from memory. Cora warns that she will arrest forty-nine people, normal or not, and Fay, helplessly, identifies all the Cookies, except Hapgood. She tells him the world needs people like him, and Hapgood can't turn himself in. He asks Fay to come with him, but she still can't bring herself to break free. Parting ways, they reflect on what they briefly shared. (\u201cWith So Little to be Sure Of\u201d) Word comes of a new miracle, two towns over, of a statue with a warm heart. Soon the town is all but deserted, and Cora is again upstaged. Again, Schub has the answer - since the Cookie Jar is still successful, they can turn the entire town into one big Cookie Jar! Cora realizes she and Schub are meant for each other, and they dance off together. As Fay resumes work, Detmold's real new assistant arrives, and Fay is horrified to realize that she is even more practical, rigid and disbelieving than Fay herself, and the new nurse marches the Cookies off to the next town to disprove the new miracle. Horrified at seeing what she might become, Fay returns to the rock calling for Hapgood. When he doesn't answer, she tries to whistle - and succeeds in blowing a shrill, ugly whistle. Hapgood appears again, saying 'That's good enough for me.' As they embrace, the water begins flowing from the rock - a true miracle this time. (Finale)\nMusical numbers.\n\"(From the Broadway production\")\nNotes \nCritical response.\nHoward Taubman in his \"The New York Times\" review wrote that Laurents's \"book lacks the fantasy that would make the idea work, and his staging has not improved matters. Mr. Sondheim has written several pleasing songs but not enough of them to give the musical wings. The performers yell rather than talk and run rather than walk. The dancing is the cream.\"\nSteven Suskin wrote in his 2000 book about Broadway composers: The \"fascinating extended musical scenes, with extended choral work, ... immediately marked Sondheim as the most distinctive theatre composer of his time.

{"id": "2952", "revid": "19545129", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2952", "title": "Alcopop", "text": "An alcopop (or cooler, spirit cooler in South African English, or malternative in America) is any of certain flavored alcoholic beverages with relatively low alcohol content (e.g., 3\u20137% alcohol by volume), including:\nThe term alcopop (a portmanteau of the words \"alcohol\" and \"pop\") is used commonly in the United Kingdom to describe these drinks. Other terms include FAB (flavored alcoholic beverage), FMB (flavored malt beverage), PPS (pre-packaged spirit or premium packaged spirits), and RTD (ready-to-drink \u2013 Australia and New Zealand).\nDescription.\nThere are a variety of beverages produced and marketed around the world as well as within each market which are described as coolers or alcopops. They tend to be sweet and served in small bottles (typically 355 ml (the normal size of a soda pop can) in the US, 275 ml in South Africa and Germany, 330 ml in Canada and Europe), and between 4% and 7% ABV. In Europe, Canada, and South Africa coolers tend to be pre-mixed spirits, including vodka (e.g. Smirnoff Ice) or rum (e.g. Bacardi Breezer). In the United States, on the other hand, alcopops often start out as un-hopped beers, depending on the state in which they are sold. Much of the malt (and alcohol) is removed (leaving mostly water), with subsequent addition of alcohol (usually vodka or grain alcohol), sugar, coloring and flavoring. Such drinks are legally classified as beers in virtually all states and can therefore be sold in outlets that do not or cannot carry spirit-based drinks. There are, however, stronger ones that \"are\" simply pre-mixed spirits (e.g. Bacardi Rum Island Iced Tea), often containing about 12.5% alcohol by volume, that can be sold only where hard liquor is available.\nIn the United States there is a proportionally limited tax on alcopops relative to those sold in Europe, although some states are considering legislation to bring their tax levels closer to the European model, which is credited with limiting consumption by youth.\nAccording to the US Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB):\nFlavored malt beverages are brewery products that differ from traditional malt beverages such as beer, ale, lager, porter, stout, or malt liquor in several respects. Flavored malt beverages exhibit little or no traditional beer or malt beverage character. Their flavor is derived primarily from added flavors rather than from malt and other materials used in fermentation. At the same time, flavored malt beverages are marketed in traditional beer-type bottles and cans and distributed to the alcohol beverage market through beer and malt beverage wholesalers, and their alcohol content is similar to other malt beverages in the 4-6% alcohol by volume range.\nAlthough flavored malt beverages are produced at breweries, their method of production differs significantly from the production of other malt beverages and beer. In producing flavored malt beverages, brewers brew a fermented base of beer from malt and other brewing materials. Brewers then treat this base using a variety of processes in order to remove malt beverage character from the base. For example, they remove the color, bitterness, and taste generally associated with beer, ale, porter, stout, and other malt beverages. This leaves a base product to which brewers add various flavors, which typically contain distilled spirits, to achieve the desired taste profile and alcohol level.\nWhile the alcohol content of flavored malt beverages is similar to that of most traditional malt beverages, the alcohol in many of them is derived primarily from the distilled spirits component of the added flavors rather than from fermentation.\nIn some Continental European countries, such as Austria and Germany, bottled beer cocktails and shandies are available, which are being marketed the same way like alcopops. However, these beverages are based on traditional hopped beers and therefore not considered to be alcopops.\nHistory.\nWine coolers gained popularity in the US market in the 1980s when Bartles and Jaymes began advertising their brand of wine coolers, which were followed by other brands, including when Bacardi introduced the Breezer. A growth in popularity occurred around 1993 with Two Dogs, DNA Alcoholic Spring Water, Hooper's Hooch and Zima, which was marketed under the title of \"malternative beverage.\" Wine coolers were on the decline due to the increase in the US federal wine tax, and using a malt-beverage base became the new industry standard. Later, Mike's Hard Lemonade was released in the United States, with humorous commercials depicting what they called \"violence against lemons\". Smirnoff also came out with another citrus-flavored malt beverage in the United States in the late 1990s called Smirnoff Ice, which promoted itself with flashy commercials, usually involving trendy young people dancing in unlikely situations and places. (In the UK, Smirnoff Ice is marketed by Diageo as a PPS.)\nThrough its Alcopop-Free Zone\u00ae campaign, \" Alcohol Justice has sought to ban alcopop sales entirely since the sweet and brightly colored alcoholic drinks may appeal to children. Many cooler advertising campaigns have been criticized as trying to make alcopops appeal to young drinkers. In the United Kingdom, a media outcry during the mid-1990s arose as the tabloid press associated alcopops with under-age drinking which damaged sales and led to British liquor stores withdrawing them from their shelves.\nIn response to a complaint from the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI), the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) conducted an extensive investigation in 2001. The agency \"found no evidence of intent to target minors with FMB products, packaging, or advertising. Furthermore, after reviewing the consumer survey evidence submitted by CSPI in support of the proposition that FMBs were predominantly popular with minors, the FTC concluded that flaws in the survey's methodology limited the ability to draw conclusions from the survey data.\"\nThe Federal Trade Commission again in 2003 investigated FMB ads, product placement, and internal company marketing documents after a directive from the conferees of the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. \"The Commission's investigation found no evidence of targeting underage consumers in the marketing of FMBs. Adults 21 to 29 appear to be the intended target of FMB marketing\" and found that \"the majority of FMB drinkers are over the age of 27.\"\nIn December 2003, Ireland raised the tax on flavored malt beverages to equal that of spirits, the second-highest in Europe. Germany has imposed an extra duty of 0.80 to 0.90 euro per bottle effective August 1, 2004. To circumvent higher taxation, some German producers have switched to wine coolers, which are being marketed the same way. Some bottles now carry a warning stating that they are not for consumption by people under the legal drinking age (under 18 in the UK and 21 in the United States). On May 11, 2008, the Australian Government increased the excise tax on alcopops by 70%, to bring it in line with the tax on spirits. There is the concern this tax will encourage consumers to buy straight spirits and mix the drinks themselves, possibly resulting in drinks with a higher alcohol concentration than the premixed alternatives. This tax was revoked during March 2009 meaning the government had to pay back the 290 million collected on the tax.\nThe Federal Trade Commission report states, \"Further, industry-conducted research on consumers over the age of 21 who use FMBs shows that these consumers generally view the FMBs as substitutes for beer, ... This research also concludes that consumers are not likely to consume more than two or three FMBs on any occasion because of the products'\nsweetness.\nIn March 2018, Coca-Cola announced it would be launching an alcopop product for the first time, a \"ch\u016bhai\" beverage in Japan.\nBrands.\nBrands of coolers are numerous and their alcoholic base vary greatly. Some notable brands include: VK Vodkakick, Smirnoff Ice, Mike's Hard Lemonade, Bacardi Breezer, Palm Bay, Skyy Blue, Jack Daniel's Hard Cola and in the UK WKD Original Vodka.\nAttempts to discourage.\nAustralia.\nThe Australian government increased the tax on these drinks under the 2008 budget to the same rate as spirits, volumetrically, in an effort to stop binge drinking. The tax was criticized by the opposition as a tax grab, and voted down in the Senate on March 18, 2009. Before its rejection, the tax had already raised at least A$290 million after April 2008. In April 2009, some Labor party MPs planned to resubmit the tax to the Senate, and it was finally approved in August 2009, increasing the tax on the drinks from $39.36 to $66.67 per litre of alcohol. A 2013 study concluded that the tax had no impact on binge drinking of the drinks by teenagers.\nGermany.\nOn 1 July 2004 the German government increased the tax on mixed drinks based on spirits (e.g. vodka, rum) by roughly one Euro per 275-ml-bottle in order to discourage teenagers drinking excessively, although those drinks were already prohibited for those under the age of 18. This had two implications: The most common alcopops, such as Smirnoff Ice or Bacardi Breezer, were nearly taken off the market, while other manufacturers changed the recipes of their drinks to replace spirit alcohols with wine or beer, but with the same ABV, enabling these mixed drinks (which are not \"alcopops\" under German law) to be sold legally to minors 16 and 17 years of age.\nPhilippines.\nIn 2019, some senators including Pia Cayetano and former Special Assistant to the President Bong Go called for pullout of alcopops from the market due to \"deceptive packaging that resembles fruit juices usually bought by young consumers\". Alcopops also have seven percent alcohol content, which is slightly lower than that of local beer brand Red Horse Beer.\nSouth Africa.\nIn South Africa, \"spirit coolers\" cannot be sold to persons under the age of 18. They are only sold at liquor stores.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn June 1997, Co-op Food became the first major retailer to place an outright ban on the sale of alcopops in its shops. This has since been rescinded."}
{"id": "2955", "revid": "407620", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2955", "title": "Alkali", "text": "In chemistry, an alkali (; from \"al-qaly\" \"ashes of the saltwort\") is a basic, ionic salt of an alkali metal or an alkaline earth metal. An alkali can also be defined as a base that dissolves in water. A solution of a soluble base has a pH greater than 7.0. The adjective alkaline is commonly, and alkalescent less often, used in English as a synonym for basic, especially for bases soluble in water. This broad use of the term is likely to have come about because alkalis were the first bases known to obey the Arrhenius definition of a base, and they are still among the most common bases.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"alkali\" is derived from Arabic \"al qal\u012by\" (or \"alkali\"), meaning \"the calcined ashes\" (see calcination), referring to the original source of alkaline substances. A water-extract of burned plant ashes, called potash and composed mostly of potassium carbonate, was mildly basic. After heating this substance with calcium hydroxide (\"slaked lime\"), a far more strongly basic substance known as \"caustic potash\" (potassium hydroxide) was produced. Caustic potash was traditionally used in conjunction with animal fats to produce soft soaps, one of the caustic processes that rendered soaps from fats in the process of saponification, one known since antiquity. Plant potash lent the name to the element potassium, which was first derived from caustic potash, and also gave potassium its chemical symbol K (from the German name Kalium), which ultimately derived from alkali.\nCommon properties of alkalis and bases.\nAlkalis are all Arrhenius bases, ones which form hydroxide ions (OH\u2212) when dissolved in water. Common properties of alkaline aqueous solutions include:\nDifference between alkali and base.\nThe terms \"base\" and \"alkali\" are often used interchangeably, particularly outside the context of chemistry and chemical engineering.\nThere are various more specific definitions for the concept of an alkali. Alkalis are usually defined as a subset of the bases. One of two subsets is commonly chosen.\nThe second subset of bases is also called an \"Arrhenius base\".\nAlkali salts.\nAlkali salts are soluble hydroxides of alkali metals and alkaline earth metals, of which common examples are:\nAlkaline soil.\nSoils with pH values that are higher than 7.3 are usually defined as being alkaline. These soils can occur naturally, due to the presence of alkali salts. Although many plants do prefer slightly basic soil (including vegetables like cabbage and fodder like buffalo grass), most plants prefer a mildly acidic soil (with pHs between 6.0 and 6.8), and alkaline soils can cause problems.\nAlkali lakes.\nIn alkali lakes (also called \"soda lakes\"), evaporation concentrates the naturally occurring carbonate salts, giving rise to an alkalic and often saline lake.\nExamples of alkali lakes:"}

Black Women and Feminism is a 1981 book by bell hooks titled after Sojourner Truth's \"Ain't I a Woman?\" speech. hooks examines the effect of racism and sexism on Black women, the civil rights movement, and feminist movements from suffrage to the 1970s. She argues that the convergence of sexism and racism during slavery contributed to Black women having the lowest status and worst conditions of any group in American society. White female abolitionists and suffragists were often more comfortable with Black male abolitionists such as Frederick Douglass, while southern segregationalists and stereotypes of Black female promiscuity and immorality caused protests whenever Black women spoke. Hooks points out that these white female reformers were more concerned with white morality than the conditions these morals caused Black Americans.\nFurther, she argues that the stereotypes that were set during slavery still affect Black women today. She argued that slavery allowed white society to stereotype white women as the pure goddess virgin and move Black women to the seductive whore stereotype formerly placed on all women, thus justifying the devaluation of Black femininity and rape of Black women. The work which Black women have been forced to perform, either in slavery or in a discriminatory workplace, that would be non-gender conforming for white women has been used against Black women as a proof of their emasculating behaviour. bell hooks argues that Black nationalism was largely a patriarchal and misogynist movement, seeking to overcome racial divisions by strengthening sexist ones, and that it readily latched onto the idea of the emasculating Black \"matriarch\" proposed by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, whose theories bell hooks often criticizes.\nMeanwhile, she says, the \"feminist movement\", a largely white middle and upper class affair, did not articulate the needs of poor and non-white women, thus reinforcing sexism, racism, and classism. She suggests this explains the low numbers of Black women who participated in the feminist movement in the 1970s, pointing to Louis Harris' Virginia Slims poll done in 1972 for Philip Morris that she says showed 62 percent of Black women supported \"efforts to change women's status\" and 67 percent \"sympathized with the women's rights movement\", compared with 45 and 35 percent of white women (also Steinem, 1972). \nReception.\nSince its publication, \"Ain't I a Woman\" has been critically acclaimed as groundbreaking in the study of feminist theory for discussing the correlation between the history of oppression Black women have faced in the United States and its lingering effects in modern American society. \"Ain't I a Woman\" is praised for tackling the intersection of race and gender that marginalizes Black women. hooks' writing has also opened the door for other Black women to write and theorize about similar topics. The book is commonly used in gender studies, Black studies, and philosophy courses.\nThe work has led to some criticism of her being \"ahistorical, unscholarly (there were many complaints about the absence of footnotes), and homophobic\". She does not provide a bibliography for any of her work, making it difficult to find the editors and publication information for the pieces listed under the \"notes\" section of her work. In \"Theory as Liberatory Practice,\" hooks explains that her lack of conventional academic format was \"motivated by the desire to be inclusive, to reach as many readers as possible in as many different locations as possible\".\nIn \"Remembered Rapture: The Writer at Work; By bell hooks; Mother to Mother,\" Nicole Abraham criticizes hooks's unconventional format rationalization. Abraham suggests that, if her rationalization for not providing footnotes and bibliographic information in her writing is that it will help her reach a broader, presumably less academic audience, hooks either assumes that the average person is uninterested in pursuing her sources and ideas or implies that her readers are too lazy or unsophisticated for proper endnotes.\nReferences.\nSojourner's Speech, Transcribed by Marius Robinson; Anti-slavery bugle. volume (New-Lisbon, Ohio), 21 June 1851.

AMOS BASIC was published by Europress Software and originally written by Fran\u00e7ois Lionet with Constantin Sotiropoulos.\nHistory.\nAMOS is a descendant of STOS BASIC for the Atari ST. AMOS BASIC was first produced in 1990.\nAMOS competed on the Amiga platform with Acid Software's Blitz BASIC. Both BASICs differed from other dialects on different platforms, in that they allowed the easy creation of fairly demanding multimedia software, with full structured code and many high-level functions to load images, animations, sounds and display them in various ways.\nThe original AMOS was a BASIC interpreter which, whilst working fine, suffered the same disadvantages of any language being run interpretively. By all accounts, AMOS was extremely fast among interpreted languages, being speedy enough that an extension called AMOS 3D could produce playable 3D games even on plain 7\u00a0MHz 68000 Amigas. Later, an AMOS compiler was developed that further increased speed. AMOS could also run MC68000 machine code, loaded into a program's memory banks.\nTo simplify animation of sprites, AMOS included the AMOS Animation Language (AMAL), a compiled sprite scripting language which runs independently of the main AMOS BASIC program. It was also possible to control screen and \"rainbow\" effects using AMAL scripts. AMAL scripts in effect created CopperLists, small routines executed by the Amiga's Agnus chip.\nAfter the original version of AMOS, Europress released a compiler (AMOS Compiler), and two other versions of the language: Easy AMOS, a simpler version for beginners, and AMOS Professional, a more advanced version with added features, such as a better IDE, ARexx support, a new UI API and new flow control constructs. Neither of these new versions was significantly more popular than the original AMOS.\nAMOS was used mostly to make multimedia software, video games (platformers and graphical adventures) and educational software.\nThe language was mildly successful within the Amiga community. Its ease of use made it especially attractive to beginners.\nPerhaps AMOS BASIC's biggest disadvantage, stemming from its Atari ST lineage, was its incompatibility with the Amiga's operating system functions and interfaces. Instead, AMOS BASIC controlled the computer directly, which caused programs written in it to have a non-standard user interface, and also caused compatibility problems with newer versions of hardware.\nToday, the language has declined in popularity along with the Amiga computer for which it was written. Despite this, a small community of enthusiasts are still using it. The source code to AMOS was released around 2001 under a BSD style license by Clickteam, a company that includes the original programmer.\nOn the 4 April 2019, Fran\u00e7ois Lionet announced the release of AMOS2 on his website amos2.org. AMOS2 replaces STOS and AMOS together, using JavaScript as its code interpreter, making the new development system independent and generally deployed in internet browsers.\nAmos 2 is now called AOZ Studio. Its website is at https://www.aoz.studio/.\nSoftware.\nSoftware written using AMOS BASIC includes:"}

It was discontinued only 18 months later, with a total of 35 games having been released. Emerson licensed the Arcadia 2001 to Bandai, which released it in Japan. Over 30 Arcadia 2001 clones exist.\nThe unrelated Arcadia Corporation, manufacturer of the Atari 2600 Supercharger add-on, was sued by Emerson for trademark infringement. Arcadia Corporation then changed its name to Starpath.\nDescription.\nThe Arcadia is much smaller than its contemporary competitors and is powered by a standard 12 volt power supply so it can be used in a boat or a vehicle. It also has two outputs (or inputs) headphone jacks on the back of the unit, on the far left and far right sides.\nThe system came with two Intellivision-style controllers with a 12-button keypad and 'fire' buttons on the sides. The direction pads have a removable joystick attachment. Most games came with BoPET overlays that could be applied to the controller's keypads. The console itself had five buttons: power, start, reset, option, and select.\nThere are at least three different types of cartridge case styles and artwork, with variations on each. Emerson-family cartridges come in two different lengths (short and long) of black plastic cases.\nConsole variants and clones.\nMany variants and clones of the Arcadia 2001 have been released by various companies in different countries. These systems are mostly compatible with each other. In 1982, the Bandai Arcadia was released only in Japan. Four exclusive games were released for the system.\nBandai Arcadia.\nIn 1982, the Bandai Arcadia, a variant of the Emerson Arcadia 2001, was licensed and distributed to Japan by Bandai for a price of 19,800 yen. There were four Japan-exclusive games released by Bandai.\nReception.\nAfter seeing the Arcadia 2001 at the summer 1982 Consumer Electronics Show, Danny Goodman of \"Creative Computing Video &amp; Arcade Games\" reported that its graphics were similar to the Atari 2600's, and that \"our overall impression of the game play was favorable for a system in this price range, though no cartridge stands out as being an exciting original creation\". He called the controller offering both Intellivision-like disc and joystick functionality \"A great idea\".\nGames.\nEmerson planned to launch the console with 19 games. Some Arcadia 2001 games are ports of lesser-known arcade games such as \"Route 16\", \"Jungler\", and \"Jump Bug\", which were not available on other home systems.\nEmerson actually created many popular arcade titles including \"Pac-Man\", \"Galaxian\" and \"Defender\" for the Arcadia, but never had them manufactured as Atari started to sue its competitor companies for releasing games to which it had exclusive-rights agreements. Early marketing showed popular arcade games, but they were later released as clones. For instance, the Arcadia 2001 game \"Space Raiders\" is a clone of \"Defender\", and \"Breakaway\" is a clone of \"Breakout\".\nReleased games.\nThere are 47 games known to have been released for the Arcadia 2001 and its clones."}

It has been called the Archimedean honeycombs by analogy with the convex uniform (non-regular) polyhedra, commonly called Archimedean solids. Recently Conway has suggested naming the set as the Architectonic tessellations and the dual honeycombs as the Catoptric tessellations.\nThe individual honeycombs are listed with names given to them by Norman Johnson. (Some of the terms used below are defined in Uniform 4-polytope#Geometric derivations for 46 nonprismatic Wythoffian uniform 4-polytopes)\nFor cross-referencing, they are given with list indices from Andreini (1-22), Williams(1-2,9-19), Johnson (11-19, 21\u201325, 31\u201334, 41\u201349, 51\u201352, 61\u201365), and Gr\u00fcnbaum(1-28). Coxeter uses \u03b44 for a cubic honeycomb, h\u03b44 for an alternated cubic honeycomb, q\u03b44 for a quarter cubic honeycomb, with subscripts for other forms based on the ring patterns of the Coxeter diagram.\nCompact Euclidean uniform tessellations (by their infinite Coxeter group families).\nThe fundamental infinite Coxeter groups for 3-space are:\nThere is a correspondence between all three families. Removing one mirror from formula_1 produces formula_2, and removing one mirror from formula_2 produces formula_3. This allows multiple constructions of the same honeycombs. If cells are colored based on unique positions within each Wythoff construction, these different symmetries can be shown.\nIn addition there are 5 special honeycombs which don't have pure reflectional symmetry and are constructed from reflectional forms with \"elongation\" and \"gyration\" operations.\nThe total unique honeycombs above are 18.\nThe prismatic stacks from infinite Coxeter groups for 3-space are:\nIn addition there is one special \"elongated\" form of the triangular prismatic honeycomb.\nThe total unique prismatic honeycombs above (excluding the cubic counted previously) are 10.\nCombining these counts, 18 and 10 gives us the total 28 uniform honeycombs.\nThe C~3, [4,3,4] group (cubic).\nThe regular cubic honeycomb, represented by Schl\u00e4fli symbol {4,3,4}, offers seven unique derived uniform honeycombs via truncation operations. (One redundant form, the \"runcinated cubic honeycomb\", is included for completeness though identical to the cubic honeycomb.) The reflectional symmetry is the affine Coxeter group [4,3,4]. There are four index 2 subgroups that generate alternations: [1+,4,3,4], [(4,3,4,2+)], [4,3+,4], and [4,3,4]+, with the first two generated repeated forms, and the last two are nonuniform.\nB~3, [4,31,1] group.\nThe formula_2, [4,3] group offers 11 derived forms via truncation operations, four being unique uniform honeycombs. There are 3 index 2 subgroups that generate alternations: [1+,4,31,1], [4,(31,1)+], and [4,31,1]+. The first generates repeated honeycomb, and the last two are nonuniform but included for completeness.\nThe honeycombs from this group are called \"alternated cubic\" because the first form can be seen as a \"cubic honeycomb\" with alternate vertices removed, reducing cubic cells to tetrahedra and creating octahedron cells in the gaps.\nNodes are indexed left to right as \"0,1,0',3\" with 0' being below and interchangeable with \"0\". The \"alternate cubic\" names given are based on this ordering.\nA~3, [3[4])] group.\nThere are 5 forms constructed from the formula_3, [3[4]] Coxeter group, of which only the \"quarter cubic honeycomb\" is unique. There is one index 2 subgroup [3[4]]+ which generates the snub form, which is not uniform, but included for completeness.\nNonwythoffian forms (gyrated and elongated).\nThree more uniform honeycombs are generated by breaking one or another of the above honeycombs where its faces form a continuous plane, then rotating alternate layers by 60 or 90 degrees (\"gyration\") and/or inserting a layer of prisms (\"elongation\").\nThe elongated and gyroelongated alternated cubic tilings have the same vertex figure, but are not alike. In the \"elongated\" form, each prism meets a tetrahedron at one triangular end and an octahedron at the other. In the \"gyroelongated\" form, prisms that meet tetrahedra at both ends alternate with prisms that meet octahedra at both ends.\nThe gyroelongated triangular prismatic tiling has the same vertex figure as one of the plain prismatic tilings; the two may be derived from the gyrated and plain triangular prismatic tilings, respectively, by inserting layers of cubes.\nPrismatic stacks.\nEleven prismatic tilings are obtained by stacking the eleven uniform plane tilings, shown below, in parallel layers. (One of these honeycombs is the cubic, shown above.) The vertex figure of each is an irregular bipyramid whose faces are isosceles triangles.\nThe C~2\u00d7I~1(\u221e), [4,4,2,\u221e], prismatic group.\nThere are only 3 unique honeycombs from the square tiling, but all 6 tiling truncations are listed below for completeness, and tiling images are shown by colors corresponding to each form.\nEnumeration of Wythoff forms.\nAll nonprismatic Wythoff constructions by Coxeter groups are given below, along with their alternations. Uniform solutions are indexed with Branko Gr\u00fcnbaum's listing. Green backgrounds are shown on repeated honeycombs, with the relations are expressed in the extended symmetry diagrams.\nExamples.\nAll 28 of these tessellations are found in crystal arrangements.\nThe alternated cubic honeycomb is of special importance since its vertices form a cubic close-packing of spheres. The space-filling truss of packed octahedra and tetrahedra was apparently first discovered by Alexander Graham Bell and independently re-discovered by Buckminster Fuller (who called it the octet truss and patented it in the 1940s).\n. Octet trusses are now among the most common types of truss used in construction.\nFrieze forms.\nIf cells are allowed to be uniform tilings, more uniform honeycombs can be defined:\nFamilies:\nScaliform honeycomb.\nA scaliform honeycomb is vertex-transitive, like a \"uniform honeycomb\", with regular polygon faces while cells and higher elements are only required to be \"orbiforms\", equilateral, with their vertices lying on hyperspheres. For 3D honeycombs, this allows a subset of Johnson solids along with the uniform polyhedra. Some scaliforms can be generated by an alternation process, leaving, for example, pyramid and cupola gaps.\nHyperbolic forms.\nThere are 9 Coxeter group families of compact uniform honeycombs in hyperbolic 3-space, generated as Wythoff constructions, and represented by ring permutations of the Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams for each family.\nFrom these 9 families, there are a total of 76 unique honeycombs generated:\nThe full list of hyperbolic uniform honeycombs has not been proven and an unknown number of non-Wythoffian forms exist. One known example is in the {3,5,3} family.\nParacompact hyperbolic forms.\nThere are also 23 paracompact Coxeter groups of rank 4.

An assassination may be prompted by political and military motives, or done for financial gain, to avenge a grievance, from a desire to acquire fame or notoriety, or because of a military, security, insurgent or secret police group's command to carry out the assassination. Acts of assassination have been performed since ancient times.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"assassin\" is often believed to derive from the word \"hashshashin\" (Arabic: \u062d\u0634\u0651\u0627\u0634\u064a\u0646, \u0127ashsh\u0101sh\u012by\u012bn, also hashishin, hashashiyyin, or assassins), and shares its etymological roots with \"hashish\" ( or ; from Arabic: \"\"). It referred to a group of Nizari Ismailis known as the Assassins who worked against various political targets.\nFounded by Hassan-i Sabbah, the Assassins were active in the fortress of Alamut in Persia from the 8th to the 14th centuries, and later expanded into a \"de facto\" state by acquiring or building many scattered strongholds. The group killed members of the Abbasid, Seljuk, Fatimid, and Christian Crusader elite for political and religious reasons.\nAlthough it is commonly believed that Assassins were under the influence of hashish during their killings or during their indoctrination, there is debate as to whether these claims have merit, with many Eastern writers and an increasing number of Western academics coming to believe that drug-taking was not the key feature behind the name.\nThe earliest known use of the verb \"to assassinate\" in printed English was by Matthew Sutcliffe in \"A Briefe Replie to a Certaine Odious and Slanderous Libel, Lately Published by a Seditious Jesuite\", a pamphlet printed in 1600, five years before it was used in \"Macbeth\" by William Shakespeare (1605).\nUse in history.\nAncient to medieval times.\nAssassination is one of the oldest tools of power politics. It dates back at least as far as recorded history.\nIn the Old Testament, King Joash of Judah was assassinated by his own servants; Joab assassinated Absalom, King David's son; and King Sennacherib of Assyria was assassinated by his own sons.\nChanakya (c. 350\u2013283 BC) wrote about assassinations in detail in his political treatise \"Arthashastra\". His student Chandragupta Maurya, the founder of the Maurya Empire, later made use of assassinations against some of his enemies, including two of Alexander the Great's generals, Nicanor and Philip. Other famous victims are Philip II of Macedon (336\u00a0BC), the father of Alexander the Great, and Roman dictator Julius Caesar (44\u00a0BC). Emperors of Rome often met their end in this way, as did many of the Muslim Shia Imams hundreds of years later. The practice was also well known in ancient China, as in Jing Ke's failed assassination of Qin king Ying Zheng in 227\u00a0BC. Whilst many assassinations were performed by individuals or small groups, there were also specialized units who used a collective group of people to perform more than one assassination. The earliest were the sicarii in 6 AD, who predated the Middle Eastern assassins and Japanese shinobis by centuries.\nIn the Middle Ages, regicide was rare in Western Europe, but it was a recurring theme in the Eastern Roman Empire. Strangling in the bathtub was the most commonly used method. With the Renaissance, tyrannicide\u2014or assassination for personal or political reasons\u2014became more common again in Western Europe. High medieval sources mention the assassination of King Demetrius Zvonimir (1089), dying at the hands of his own people, who objected to a proposition by the pope to go on a campaign to aid the Byzantines against the Seljuk Turks. This account is, however, contentious among historians, it being most commonly asserted that he died of natural causes. The myth of the \"Curse of King Zvonimir\" is based on the legend of his assassination. In 1192, Conrad of Montferrat, the \"de facto\" King of Jerusalem, was killed by an assassin.\nThe reigns of King Przemys\u0142 II of Poland (1296), William the Silent of the Netherlands (1584), and the French kings Henry III (1589) and Henry IV (1610) were all ended by assassins.\nDuring the 16th and 17th century, international lawyers began to voice condemnation of assasssinations of leaders. Balthazar Ayala has been described as \"the first prominent jurist to condemn the use of assassination in foreign policy.\" Alberico Gentili condemned assassinations in a 1598 publication where he appealed to the self-interest of leaders: (i) assassinations had adverse short-term consequences by arousing the ire of the assassinated leader's successor, and (ii) assassinations had the adverse long-term consequences of causing disorder and chaos. Hugo Grotius's works on the law of war strictly forbade assassinations, arguing that killing was only permissible on the battlefield.\nModern history.\nIn the modern world, the killing of important people began to become more than a tool in power struggles between rulers themselves and was also used for political symbolism, such as in the propaganda of the deed. In Russia alone, two emperors, Paul I and his grandson Alexander II, were assassinated within 80 years. In the United Kingdom, only one Prime Minister has been assassinated\u2014Spencer Perceval on May 11, 1812.\nIn Japan, a group of assassins called the Four Hitokiri of the Bakumatsu killed a number of people, including Ii Naosuke who was the head of administration for the Tokugawa shogunate, during the Boshin War. Most of the assassinations in Japan were committed with bladed weaponry, a trait that was carried on into modern history. A video-record exists of the assassination of Inejiro Asanuma, using a sword.\nIn the United States, within 100 years, four presidents\u2014Abraham Lincoln, James A. Garfield, William McKinley and John F. Kennedy\u2014died at the hands of assassins. There have been at least 20 known attempts on U.S. presidents' lives. Huey Long, a senator, was assassinated on September 10, 1935. Robert F. Kennedy, a senator and a presidential candidate, was also assassinated on June 6, 1968, in the United States.\nIn Austria, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie, Duchess of Hohenberg in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914, carried out by Gavrilo Princip, a Serbian national and a member of the Serbian nationalist insurgents (The Black Hand), is blamed for igniting World War I after a succession of minor conflicts, while belligerents on both sides in World War II used operatives specifically trained for assassination. Reinhard Heydrich died after an attack by British-trained Czechoslovak soldiers on behalf of the Czechoslovak government in exile in Operation Anthropoid, and knowledge from decoded transmissions allowed the United States to carry out a targeted attack, killing Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto while he was travelling by plane. The Polish Home Army conducted a regular campaign of assassinations against top Nazi German officials in occupied Poland. Adolf Hitler was almost killed by his own officers, and survived various attempts by other persons and organizations (such as Operation Foxley, though this plan was never put into practice).\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, Joseph Stalin's NKVD carried out numerous assassinations outside of the Soviet Union, such as the killings of Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists leader Yevhen Konovalets, Ignace Poretsky, Fourth International secretary Rudolf Klement, Leon Trotsky, and the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) leadership in Catalonia.\nIndia's \"Father of the Nation\", Mahatma Gandhi, was shot to death on January 30, 1948, by Nathuram Godse.\nThe African-American civil rights activist, Martin Luther King Jr., was assassinated on April 4, 1968, at the Lorraine Motel (now the National Civil Rights Museum) in Memphis, Tennessee. Three years prior, another African-American civil rights activist, Malcolm X, was assassinated at the Audubon Ballroom on February 21, 1965. Two years prior, another African-American civil rights activist, Medgar Evers, was assassinated on June 12, 1963. Fred Hampton of the Black Panther Party was assassinated on December 4, 1969.\nCold War and beyond.\nLiaquat Ali Khan, the first Prime Minister of Pakistan, was assassinated by Saad Akbar, a lone assassin, in 1951. Conspiracy theorists believe his conflict with certain members of the Pakistani military (the Rawalpindi Conspiracy) or suppression of communists and antagonism towards the Soviet Union, were potential reasons for his assassination.\nIn 1960, Inejiro Asanuma, the chairman of the Japanese Socialist Party, was stabbed to death by a right-wing extremist.\nThe U.S. Senate Select Committee, chaired by Senator Frank Church (the Church Committee), reported in 1975 that it had found \"concrete evidence of at least eight plots involving the CIA to assassinate Fidel Castro from 1960 to 1965.\"\nMost major powers repudiated Cold War assassination tactics, but many allege that was merely a smokescreen for political benefit and that covert and illegal training of assassins continues today, with Russia, Israel, the U.S., Argentina, Paraguay, Chile, and other nations accused of engaging in such operations. In 1986, U.S. President Ronald Reagan, who has survived an assassination attempt himself, ordered the Operation El Dorado Canyon air raid on Libya in which one of the primary targets was the home residence of Libyan ruler Muammar Gaddafi. Gaddafi escaped unharmed, but his adopted daughter Hanna was claimed to be one of the civilian casualties.\nIn the Philippines, the assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr., triggered the eventual downfall of the 20-year autocratic rule of President Ferdinand Marcos. Aquino, a former senator and a leading figure of the political opposition, was assassinated in 1983 at the Manila International Airport (now the Ninoy Aquino International Airport) after he had returned home from exile. His death thrust his widow, Corazon Aquino into the limelight and ultimately, the presidency after the peaceful 1986 EDSA Revolution.\nAfter the Iranian Revolution of 1979, the new Islamic government of Iran began an international campaign of assassination that lasted into the 1990s. At least 162 killings in 19 countries have been linked to the senior leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran. The campaign came to an end after the Mykonos restaurant assassinations because a German court publicly implicated senior members of the government and issued arrest warrants for Ali Fallahian, the head of Iranian intelligence. Evidence indicates that Fallahian's personal involvement and individual responsibility for the murders were far more pervasive than his current indictment record represents.\nAnwar Sadat, the president of the Arab Republic of Egypt (formerly the president of the United Arab Republic), was assassinated October 6, 1981, during the annual parade celebrating Operation Badr, the opening maneuver of the Yom Kippur War.\nSwedish Prime Minister Olof Palme was murdered by a gun-wielding man close to midnight on February 28, 1986, after having visited a cinema with his wife. The couple was not accompanied by a bodyguard detail. In 2020 Swedish prosecutors named Stig Engstr\u00f6m as the killer.\nOn August 17, 1988, President of Pakistan Gen. M. Zia ul Haq died alongside 31 others, including the Chief of Staff of the Pakistani Armed Forces, the US Ambassador to Pakistan and the chief of the US Military Mission to Pakistan, when his C-130 transport plane mysteriously crashed. The crash is widely considered in Pakistan to be an act of political assassination.\nIn post-Saddam Iraq, the Shiite-dominated government used death squads to perform extrajudicial executions of radical Sunni Iraqis, with some alleging that the death squads were trained by the U.S. Concrete allegations have since surfaced that the Iranian government has actively armed and funded Shia death-squads in post-Saddam Iraq.\nIn India, Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and her son Rajiv Gandhi (neither of whom was related to Mahatma Gandhi, who had himself been assassinated in 1948), were assassinated in 1984 and 1991 respectively in what were linked to separatist movements in Punjab and northern Sri Lanka, respectively.\nIn Israel, Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated on November 4, 1995. Yigal Amir confessed to and was convicted of the crime.\nIsraeli Tourist Minister Rehavam Ze'evi was assassinated on October 17, 2001 by Hamdi Quran and three other members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), which stated that the assassination was in retaliation for the August 27, 2001 killing of Abu Ali Mustafa, the Secretary General of the PFLP, by the Israeli Air Force under its policy of targeted killings.\nIn Lebanon, the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri on February 14, 2005, prompted an investigation by the United Nations. The suggestion in the resulting \"Mehlis report\" that there was involvement by Syria prompted the Cedar Revolution, which drove Syrian troops out of Lebanon.\nIn Pakistan, a former prime minister and opposition leader, Benazir Bhutto, was assassinated in 2007 while she was running for election. Bhutto's assassination drew unanimous condemnation from the international community.\nIn Guinea Bissau, President Jo\u00e3o Bernardo Vieira was assassinated in the early hours of March 2, 2009, in the capital, Bissau. Unlike typical assassinations, his death was not swift; he first survived an explosion at the Presidential Villa, was then shot and wounded, and was finally butchered with machetes. His assassination was carried out by renegade soldiers, who were apparently avenging the death of General Tagme Na Waie, the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of Guinea Bissau, who had been killed by a bomb exploding the day before.\nFurther motivations.\nAs a military and foreign policy doctrine.\nAssassination for military purposes has long been espoused: Sun Tzu, writing around 500\u00a0BC, argued in favor of using assassination in his book \"The Art of War\". Nearly 2000 years later, in his book \"The Prince\", Machiavelli also advises rulers to assassinate enemies whenever possible to prevent them from posing a threat. An army and even a nation might be based upon and around a particularly strong, canny, or charismatic leader, whose loss could paralyze the ability of both to make war.\nFor similar and additional reasons, assassination has also sometimes been used in the conduct of foreign policy. The costs and benefits of such actions are difficult to compute. It may not be clear whether the assassinated leader gets replaced with a more or less competent successor, whether the assassination provokes ire in the state in question, whether the assassination leads to souring domestic public opinion, and whether the assassination provokes condemnation from third-parties. One study found that perceptual biases held by leaders often negatively affect decision making in that area, and decisions to go forward with assassinations often reflect the vague hope that any successor might be better.\nIn both military and foreign policy assassinations, there is the risk that the target could be replaced by an even more competent leader or that such a killing (or a failed attempt) will \"martyr\" a leader and lead to greater support of his or her cause by showing the ruthlessness of the assassins. Faced with particularly brilliant leaders, that possibility has in various instances been risked, such as in the attempts to kill the Athenian Alcibiades during the Peloponnesian War. A number of additional examples from World War II show how assassination was used as a tool:\nUse of assassination has continued in more recent conflicts:\nAs a tool of insurgents.\nInsurgent groups have often employed assassination as a tool to further their causes. Assassinations provide several functions for such groups: the removal of specific enemies and as propaganda tools to focus the attention of media and politics on their cause.\nThe Irish Republican Army guerrillas in 1919 to 1921 killed many Royal Irish Constabulary Police intelligence officers during the Irish War of Independence. Michael Collins set up a special unit, the Squad, for that purpose, which had the effect of intimidating many policemen into resigning from the force. The Squad's activities peaked with the killing of 14 British agents in Dublin on Bloody Sunday in 1920.\nThe tactic was used again by the Provisional IRA during the Troubles in Northern Ireland (1969\u20131998). Killing Royal Ulster Constabulary officers and assassination of unionist politicians was one of a number of methods used in the Provisional IRA campaign 1969\u20131997. The IRA also attempted to assassinate British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher by bombing the Conservative Party Conference in a Brighton hotel. Loyalist paramilitaries retaliated by killing Catholics at random and assassinating Irish nationalist politicians.\nBasque terrorists ETA in Spain assassinated many security and political figures since the late 1960s, notably the president of the government of Spain, Luis Carrero Blanco, 1st Duke of Carrero-Blanco Grandee of Spain, in 1973. In the early 1990s, it also began to target academics, journalists and local politicians who publicly disagreed with it.\nThe Red Brigades in Italy carried out assassinations of political figures and, to a lesser extent, so did the Red Army Faction in Germany in the 1970s and the 1980s.\nIn the Vietnam War, communist insurgents routinely assassinated government officials and individual civilians deemed to offend or rival the revolutionary movement. Such attacks, along with widespread military activity by insurgent bands, almost brought the Ngo Dinh Diem regime to collapse before the US intervened.\nPsychology.\nA major study about assassination attempts in the US in the second half of the 20th century came to the conclusion that most prospective assassins spend copious amounts of time planning and preparing for their attempts. Assassinations are thus rarely \"impulsive\" actions.\nHowever, about 25% of the actual attackers were found to be delusional, a figure that rose to 60% with \"near-lethal approachers\" (people apprehended before reaching their targets). That shows that while mental instability plays a role in many modern-assassinations, the more delusional attackers are less likely to succeed in their attempts. The report also found that around two thirds of attackers had previously been arrested, not necessarily for related offenses; 44% had a history of serious depression, and 39% had a history of substance abuse.\nTechniques.\nModern methods.\nWith the advent of effective ranged weaponry and later firearms, the position of an assassination target was more precarious. Bodyguards were no longer enough to hold back determined killers, who no longer needed to engage directly or even to subvert the guard to kill the leader in question. Moreover, the engagement of targets at greater distances dramatically increased the chances for assassins to survive since they could quickly flee the scene. The first heads of government to be assassinated with a firearm were James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray, the regent of Scotland, in 1570, and William the Silent, the Prince of Orange of the Netherlands, in 1584. Gunpowder and other explosives also allowed the use of bombs or even greater concentrations of explosives for deeds requiring a larger touch.\nExplosives, especially the car bomb, become far more common in modern history, with grenades and remote-triggered land mines also used, especially in the Middle East and the Balkans; the initial attempt on Archduke Franz Ferdinand's life was with a grenade. With heavy weapons, the rocket-propelled grenade (RPG) has become a useful tool given the popularity of armored cars (discussed below), and Israeli forces have pioneered the use of aircraft-mounted missiles, as well as the innovative use of explosive devices.\nA sniper with a precision rifle is often used in fictional assassinations. However, certain pragmatic difficulties attend long-range shooting, including finding a hidden shooting position with a clear line of sight, detailed advance knowledge of the intended victim's travel plans, the ability to identify the target at long range, and the ability to score a first-round lethal hit at long range, which is usually measured in hundreds of meters. A dedicated sniper rifle is also expensive, often costing thousands of dollars because of the high level of precision machining and handfinishing required to achieve extreme accuracy.\nDespite their comparative disadvantages, handguns are more easily concealable and so are much more commonly used than rifles. Of the 74 principal incidents evaluated in a major study about assassination attempts in the US in the second half of the 20th century, 51% were undertaken by a handgun, 30% with a rifle or shotgun, 15% used knives, and 8% explosives (the use of multiple weapons/methods was reported in 16% of all cases).\nIn the case of state-sponsored assassination, poisoning can be more easily denied. Georgi Markov, a dissident from Bulgaria, was assassinated by ricin poisoning. A tiny pellet containing the poison was injected into his leg through a specially designed umbrella. Widespread allegations involving the Bulgarian government and the KGB have not led to any legal results. However, after the fall of the Soviet Union, it was learned that the KGB had developed an umbrella that could inject ricin pellets into a victim, and two former KGB agents who defected stated that the agency assisted in the murder. The CIA made several attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro, many of the schemes involving poisoning his cigars. In the late 1950s, the KGB assassin Bohdan Stashynsky killed Ukrainian nationalist leaders Lev Rebet and Stepan Bandera with a spray gun that fired a jet of poison gas from a crushed cyanide ampule, making their deaths look like heart attacks. A 2006 case in the UK concerned the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko who was given a lethal dose of radioactive polonium-210, possibly passed to him in aerosol form sprayed directly onto his food. Litvinenko, a former KGB agent, had been granted asylum in the UK in 2000 after he had cited persecution in Russia. Shortly before his death, he issued a statement accusing Russian President Vladimir Putin of involvement in his assassination. Putin, a former KGB agent, denied any involvement in Litvinenko's death.\nTargeted killing.\nTargeted killing is the intentional killing by a government or its agents of a civilian or \"unlawful combatant\" who is not in the government's custody. The target is a person asserted to be taking part in an armed conflict or terrorism, by bearing arms or otherwise, who has thereby lost the immunity from being targeted that he would otherwise have under the Third Geneva Convention. Note that it is a different term and concept from that of \"targeted violence\", as used by specialists who study violence.\nOn the other hand, Georgetown University Law Center Professor Gary D. Solis, in his 2010 book \"The Law of Armed Conflict: International Humanitarian Law in War\", wrote, \"Assassinations and targeted killings are very different acts.\" The use of the term \"assassination\" is opposed, as it denotes murder (unlawful killing), but the terrorists are targeted in self-defense, which is thus viewed as a killing but not a crime (justifiable homicide). Abraham D. Sofaer, former federal judge for the US District Court for the Southern District of New York, wrote on the subject:\nWhen people call a targeted killing an \"assassination,\" they are attempting to preclude debate on the merits of the action. Assassination is widely defined as murder, and is for that reason prohibited in the United States\u00a0... U.S. officials may not kill people merely because their policies are seen as detrimental to our interests... But killings in self-defense are no more \"assassinations\" in international affairs than they are murders when undertaken by our police forces against domestic killers. Targeted killings in self-defense have been authoritatively determined by the federal government to fall outside the assassination prohibition.\nAuthor and former U.S. Army Captain Matthew J. Morgan argued that \"there is a major difference between assassination and targeted killing... targeted killing [is] not synonymous with assassination. Assassination... constitutes an illegal killing.\" Similarly, Amos Guiora, a professor of law at the University of Utah, wrote, \"Targeted killing is... not an assassination.\" Steve David, Professor of International Relations at Johns Hopkins University, wrote, \"There are strong reasons to believe that the Israeli policy of targeted killing is not the same as assassination.\" Syracuse Law Professor William Banks and GW Law Professor Peter Raven-Hansen wrote, \"Targeted killing of terrorists is... not unlawful and would not constitute assassination.\" Rory Miller writes: \"Targeted killing... is not 'assassination.'\" Associate Professor Eric Patterson and Teresa Casale wrote, \"Perhaps most important is the legal distinction between targeted killing and assassination.\"\nOn the other hand, the American Civil Liberties Union also states on its website, \"A program of targeted killing far from any battlefield, without charge or trial, violates the constitutional guarantee of due process. It also violates international law, under which lethal force may be used outside armed conflict zones only as a last resort to prevent imminent threats, when non-lethal means are not available. Targeting people who are suspected of terrorism for execution, far from any war zone, turns the whole world into a battlefield.\"\nYael Stein, the research director of B'Tselem, the Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, also stated in her article \"By Any Name Illegal and Immoral: Response to 'Israel's Policy of Targeted Killing'\":\n\"The argument that this policy affords the public a sense of revenge and retribution could serve to justify acts both illegal and immoral. Clearly, lawbreakers ought to be punished. Yet, no matter how horrific their deeds, as the targeting of Israeli civilians indeed is, they should be punished according to the law. David's arguments could, in principle, justify the abolition of formal legal systems altogether.\"\nTargeted killing has become a frequent tactic of the United States and Israel in their fight against terrorism. The tactic can raise complex questions and lead to contentious disputes as to the legal basis for its application, who qualifies as an appropriate \"hit list\" target, and what circumstances must exist before the tactic may be used. Opinions range from people considering it a legal form of self-defense that reduces terrorism to people calling it an extra-judicial killing that lacks due process and leads to further violence. Methods used have included firing Hellfire missiles from Predator or Reaper drones (unmanned, remote-controlled planes), detonating a cell phone bomb, and long-range sniper shooting. Countries such as the US (in Pakistan and Yemen) and Israel (in the West Bank and Gaza) have used targeted killing to eliminate members of groups such as Al-Qaeda and Hamas. In early 2010, with President Obama's approval, Anwar al-Awlaki became the first US citizen to be publicly approved for targeted killing by the Central Intelligence Agency. Awlaki was killed in a drone strike in September 2011.\nUnited Nations investigator Ben Emmerson said that US drone strikes may have violated international humanitarian law. \"The Intercept\" reported, \"Between January 2012 and February 2013, U.S. special operations airstrikes [in northeastern Afghanistan] killed more than 200 people. Of those, only 35 were the intended targets.\"\nCountermeasures.\nEarly forms.\nOne of the earliest forms of defense against assassins was employing bodyguards, who act as a shield for the potential target; keep a lookout for potential attackers, sometimes in advance, such as on a parade route; and putting themselves in harm's way, both by simple presence, showing that physical force is available to protect the target, and by shielding the target if any attack occurs. To neutralize an attacker, bodyguards are typically armed as much as legal and practical concerns permit.\nNotable examples of bodyguards include the Roman Praetorian Guard or the Ottoman Janissaries, but in both cases, the protectors sometimes became assassins themselves, exploiting their power to make the head of state a virtual hostage or killing the very leaders whom they were supposed to protect. The loyalty of individual bodyguards is an important question as well, especially for leaders who oversee states with strong ethnic or religious divisions. Failure to realize such divided loyalties allowed the assassination of Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who was assassinated by two Sikh bodyguards in 1984.\nThe bodyguard function was often executed by the leader's most loyal warriors, and it was extremely effective throughout most of early human history, which led assassins to attempt stealthy means, such as poison, whose risk was reduced by having another person taste the leader's food first.\nAnother notable measure is the use of a body double, a person who looks like the leader and pretends to be the leader to draw attention away from the intended target.\nModern strategies.\nWith the advent of gunpowder, ranged assassination via bombs or firearms became possible. One of the first reactions was simply to increase the guard, creating what at times might seem a small army trailing every leader. Another was to begin clearing large areas whenever a leader was present to the point that entire sections of a city might be shut down.\nAs the 20th century dawned, the prevalence and capability of assassins grew quickly, as did measures to protect against them. For the first time, armored cars or limousines were put into service for safer transport, with modern versions virtually invulnerable to small arms fire, smaller bombs and mines. Bulletproof vests also began to be used, but since they were of limited utility, restricting movement and leaving the head unprotected, they tended to be worn only during high-profile public events, if at all.\nAccess to famous persons also became more and more restricted; potential visitors would be forced through numerous different checks before being granted access to the official in question, and as communication became better and information technology more prevalent, it has become all but impossible for a would-be killer to get close enough to the personage at work or in private life to effect an attempt on his or her life, especially with the common use of metal and bomb detectors.\nMost modern assassinations have been committed either during a public performance or during transport, both because of weaker security and security lapses, such as with U.S. President John F. Kennedy and former Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, or as part of a coup d'\u00e9tat in which security is either overwhelmed or completely removed, such as with Congolese Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba.\nThe methods used for protection by famous people have sometimes evoked negative reactions by the public, with some resenting the separation from their officials or major figures. One example might be traveling in a car protected by a bubble of clear bulletproof glass, such as the MRAP-like Popemobile of Pope John Paul II, built following an attempt at his life. Politicians often resent the need for separation and sometimes send their bodyguards away from them for personal or publicity reasons. US President William McKinley did so at the public reception in which he was assassinated.\nOther potential targets go into seclusion and are rarely heard from or seen in public, such as writer Salman Rushdie. A related form of protection is the use of body doubles, people with similar builds to those they are expected to impersonate. These persons are then made up and, in some cases, undergo plastic surgery to look like the target, with the body double then taking the place of the person in high-risk situations. According to Joe R. Reeder, Under Secretary of the Army from 1993 to 1997, Fidel Castro used body doubles.\nUS Secret Service protective agents receive training in the psychology of assassins."}

{"id": "2965", "revid": "27823944", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2965", "title": "Alcoholism", "text": "Alcoholism is, broadly, any drinking of alcohol that results in significant mental or physical health problems. Alcoholism is not a recognized diagnostic entity. Predominant diagnostic classifications are alcohol use disorder (DSM-5) or alcohol dependence (ICD-11). \nExcessive alcohol use can damage all organ systems, but it particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas and immune system. Alcoholism can result in mental illness, delirium tremens, Wernicke\u2013Korsakoff syndrome, irregular heartbeat, an impaired immune response, liver cirrhosis and increased cancer risk. Drinking during pregnancy can result in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Women are generally more sensitive than men to the harmful effects of alcohol, primarily due to their smaller body weight, lower capacity to metabolize alcohol, and higher proportion of body fat. In a small number of individuals, prolonged, severe alcohol misuse ultimately leads to frank dementia.\nEnvironmental factors and genetics are two factors affecting risk for alcoholism, with about half the risk attributed to each. Someone with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is three to four times more likely to become an alcoholic themselves, but only a minority of them do. Environmental factors include social, cultural and behavioral influences. High stress levels and anxiety, as well as alcohol's inexpensive cost and easy accessibility, increase the risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. After a person stops drinking alcohol, they may experience a low level of withdrawal lasting for months. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Questionnaires are usually used to detect possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.\nPrevention of alcoholism may be attempted by regulating and limiting the sale of alcohol (particularly to minors), taxing alcohol to increase its cost, and providing education and inexpensive treatment. Prohibition did not work. Treatment of alcoholism may take several forms. Due to medical problems that can occur during withdrawal, alcohol detoxification should be carefully controlled. One common method involves the use of benzodiazepine medications, such as diazepam. These can be either given while admitted to a health care institution or occasionally while a person remains in the community with close supervision. Mental illness or other addictions may complicate treatment. After detoxification, various forms of individual or group therapy or support groups can help keep a person from returning to drinking. One commonly used form of support is the group Alcoholics Anonymous. The medications acamprosate, disulfiram or naltrexone may also be used to help prevent further drinking.\nThe World Health Organization has estimated that as of 2016, there were 380\u00a0million people with alcoholism worldwide (5.1% of the population over 15 years of age). As of 2015 in the United States, about 17\u00a0million (7%) of adults and 0.7\u00a0million (2.8%) of those age 12 to 17 years of age are affected. Alcoholism is most common among males and young adults. Geographically, it is least common in Africa (1.1% of the population) and has the highest rates in Eastern Europe (11%). Alcoholism directly resulted in 139,000 deaths in 2013, up from 112,000 deaths in 1990. A total of 3.3\u00a0million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by approximately ten years. Many terms, some insulting and others informal, have been used to refer to people affected by alcoholism; the expressions include \"tippler\", \"drunkard\", \"dipsomaniac\" and \"souse\". In 1979, the World Health Organization discouraged the use of \"alcoholism\" due to its inexact meaning, preferring \"alcohol dependence syndrome\".\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe risk of alcohol dependence begins at low levels of drinking and increases directly with both the volume of alcohol consumed and a pattern of drinking larger amounts on an occasion, to the point of intoxication, which is sometimes called \"binge drinking\".\nLong-term misuse.\nAlcoholism is characterised by an increased tolerance to alcohol\u00a0\u2013 which means that an individual can consume more alcohol\u00a0\u2013 and physical dependence on alcohol, which makes it hard for an individual to control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having a very strong urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role in decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking. Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, contributing to psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide. A depressed mood is a common symptom of heavy alcohol drinkers.\nWarning signs.\nWarning signs of alcoholism include the consumption of increasing amounts of alcohol and frequent intoxication, preoccupation with drinking to the exclusion of other activities, promises to quit drinking and failure to keep those promises, the inability to remember what was said or done while drinking (colloquially known as \"blackouts\"), personality changes associated with drinking, denial or the making of excuses for drinking, the refusal to admit excessive drinking, dysfunction or other problems at work or school, the loss of interest in personal appearance or hygiene, marital and economic problems, and the complaint of poor health, with loss of appetite, respiratory infections, or increased anxiety.\nPhysical.\nShort-term effects.\nDrinking enough to cause a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.03\u20130.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible euphoria (a \"happy\" feeling), increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a flushed, red appearance in the face and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes lethargy, sedation, balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC of 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g. slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes stupor, unconsciousness, anterograde amnesia, vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit while unconscious) and respiratory depression (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a coma (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal alcohol poisoning. With all alcoholic beverages, drinking while driving, operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have penalties for drunk driving.\nLong-term effects.\nHaving more than one drink a day for women or two drinks for men increases the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater with binge drinking, which may also result in violence or accidents. About 3.3\u00a0million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking. Long-term alcohol misuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic dementia, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, malabsorption, alcoholic liver disease, and several cancers. Damage to the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.\nWomen develop long-term complications of alcohol dependence more rapidly than do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men. Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage and an increased risk of breast cancer. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to have a negative effect on reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as anovulation, decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the menstrual cycle, and early menopause. Alcoholic ketoacidosis can occur in individuals who chronically misuse alcohol and have a recent history of binge drinking. The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes. Equal dosages of alcohol consumed by men and women generally result in women having higher blood alcohol concentrations (BACs), since women generally have a lower weight and higher percentage of body fat and therefore a lower volume of distribution for alcohol than men.\nPsychiatric.\nLong-term misuse of alcohol can cause a wide range of mental health problems. Severe cognitive problems are common; approximately 10 percent of all dementia cases are related to alcohol consumption, making it the second leading cause of dementia. Excessive alcohol use causes damage to brain function, and psychological health can be increasingly affected over time. Social skills are significantly impaired in people suffering from alcoholism due to the neurotoxic effects of alcohol on the brain, especially the prefrontal cortex area of the brain. The social skills that are impaired by alcohol use disorder include impairments in perceiving facial emotions, prosody, perception problems, and theory of mind deficits; the ability to understand humor is also impaired in people who misuse alcohol. Psychiatric disorders are common in alcoholics, with as many as 25 percent suffering severe psychiatric disturbances. The most prevalent psychiatric symptoms are anxiety and depression disorders. Psychiatric symptoms usually initially worsen during alcohol withdrawal, but typically improve or disappear with continued abstinence. Psychosis, confusion, and organic brain syndrome may be caused by alcohol misuse, which can lead to a misdiagnosis such as schizophrenia. Panic disorder can develop or worsen as a direct result of long-term alcohol misuse.\nThe co-occurrence of major depressive disorder and alcoholism is well documented. Among those with comorbid occurrences, a distinction is commonly made between depressive episodes that remit with alcohol abstinence (\"substance-induced\"), and depressive episodes that are primary and do not remit with abstinence (\"independent\" episodes). Additional use of other drugs may increase the risk of depression. Psychiatric disorders differ depending on gender. Women who have alcohol-use disorders often have a co-occurring psychiatric diagnosis such as major depression, anxiety, panic disorder, bulimia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), or borderline personality disorder. Men with alcohol-use disorders more often have a co-occurring diagnosis of narcissistic or antisocial personality disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, impulse disorders or attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Women with alcohol use disorder are more likely to experience physical or sexual assault, abuse, and domestic violence than women in the general population, which can lead to higher instances of psychiatric disorders and greater dependence on alcohol.\nSocial effects.\nSerious social problems arise from alcohol use disorder; these dilemmas are caused by the pathological changes in the brain and the intoxicating effects of alcohol. Alcohol misuse is associated with an increased risk of committing criminal offences, including child abuse, domestic violence, rape, burglary and assault. Alcoholism is associated with loss of employment, which can lead to financial problems. Drinking at inappropriate times and behavior caused by reduced judgment can lead to legal consequences, such as criminal charges for drunk driving or public disorder, or civil penalties for tortious behavior. An alcoholic's behavior and mental impairment while drunk can profoundly affect those surrounding him and lead to isolation from family and friends. This isolation can lead to marital conflict and divorce, or contribute to domestic violence. Alcoholism can also lead to child neglect, with subsequent lasting damage to the emotional development of the alcoholic's children. For this reason, children of alcoholic parents can develop a number of emotional problems. For example, they can become afraid of their parents, because of their unstable mood behaviors. In addition, they can develop considerable amount of shame over their inadequacy to liberate their parents from alcoholism. As a result of this failure, they develop wretched self-images, which can lead to depression.\nAlcohol withdrawal.\nAs with similar substances with a sedative-hypnotic mechanism, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, withdrawal from alcohol dependence can be fatal if it is not properly managed. Alcohol's primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the GABAA receptor, promoting central nervous system depression. With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in tolerance and physical dependence. When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled synapse firing. This can result in symptoms that include anxiety, life-threatening seizures, delirium tremens, hallucinations, shakes and possible heart failure. Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved, especially dopamine, NMDA and glutamate.\nSevere acute withdrawal symptoms such as delirium tremens and seizures rarely occur after 1-week post cessation of alcohol. The acute withdrawal phase can be defined as lasting between one and three weeks. In the period of 3\u20136 weeks following cessation, anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep disturbance are common. Similar post-acute withdrawal symptoms have also been observed in animal models of alcohol dependence and withdrawal.\nA kindling effect also occurs in alcoholics whereby each subsequent withdrawal syndrome is more severe than the previous withdrawal episode; this is due to neuroadaptations which occur as a result of periods of abstinence followed by re-exposure to alcohol. Individuals who have had multiple withdrawal episodes are more likely to develop seizures and experience more severe anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol than alcohol-dependent individuals without a history of past alcohol withdrawal episodes. The kindling effect leads to persistent functional changes in brain neural circuits as well as to gene expression. Kindling also results in the intensification of psychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. There are decision tools and questionnaires that help guide physicians in evaluating alcohol withdrawal. For example, the CIWA-Ar objectifies alcohol withdrawal symptoms in order to guide therapy decisions which allows for an efficient interview while at the same time retaining clinical usefulness, validity, and reliability, ensuring proper care for withdrawal patients, who can be in danger of death.\nCauses.\nA complex combination of genetic and environmental factors influences the risk of the development of alcoholism. Genes that influence the metabolism of alcohol also influence the risk of alcoholism, as can a family history of alcoholism. There is compelling evidence that alcohol use at an early age may influence the expression of genes which increase the risk of alcohol dependence. These genetic and epigenetic results are regarded as consistent with large longitudinal population studies finding that the younger the age of drinking onset, the greater the prevalence of lifetime alcohol dependence.\nSevere childhood trauma is also associated with a general increase in the risk of drug dependency. Lack of peer and family support is associated with an increased risk of alcoholism developing. Genetics and adolescence are associated with an increased sensitivity to the neurotoxic effects of chronic alcohol misuse. Cortical degeneration due to the neurotoxic effects increases impulsive behaviour, which may contribute to the development, persistence and severity of alcohol use disorders. There is evidence that with abstinence, there is a reversal of at least some of the alcohol induced central nervous system damage. The use of cannabis was associated with later problems with alcohol use. Alcohol use was associated with an increased probability of later use of tobacco and illegal drugs such as cannabis.\nAvailability.\nAlcohol is the most available, widely consumed, and widely misused recreational drug. Beer alone is the world's most widely consumed alcoholic beverage; it is the third-most popular drink overall, after water and tea. It is thought by some to be the oldest fermented beverage.\nGender difference.\nBased on combined data in the US from SAMHSA's 2004\u20132005 National Surveys on Drug Use &amp; Health, the rate of past-year alcohol dependence or misuse among persons aged 12 or older varied by level of alcohol use: 44.7% of past month heavy drinkers, 18.5% binge drinkers, 3.8% past month non-binge drinkers, and 1.3% of those who did not drink alcohol in the past month met the criteria for alcohol dependence or misuse in the past year. Males had higher rates than females for all measures of drinking in the past month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), binge drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and males were twice as likely as females to have met the criteria for alcohol dependence or misuse in the past year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).\nGenetic variation.\nThere are genetic variations that affect the risk for alcoholism. Some of these variations are more common in individuals with ancestry from certain areas, for example Africa, East Asia, the Middle East and Europe. The variants with strongest effect are in genes that encode the main enzymes of alcohol metabolism, \"ADH1B\" and \"ALDH2\". These genetic factors influence the rate at which alcohol and its initial metabolic product, acetaldehyde, are metabolized. They are found at different frequencies in people from different parts of the world. The alcohol dehydrogenase allele \"ADH1B*2\" causes a more rapid metabolism of alcohol to acetaldehyde, and reduces risk for alcoholism; it is most common in individuals from East Asia and the Middle East. The alcohol dehydrogenase allele \"ADH1B*3\" also causes a more rapid metabolism of alcohol. The allele ADH1B*3 is only found in some individuals of African descent and certain Native American tribes. African Americans and Native Americans with this allele have a reduced risk of developing alcoholism. Native Americans, however, have a significantly higher rate of alcoholism than average; risk factors such as cultural environmental effects e.g. trauma have been proposed to explain the higher rates. The aldehyde dehydrogenase allele \"ALDH2*2\" greatly reduces the rate at which acetaldehyde, the initial product of alcohol metabolism, is removed by conversion to acetate; it greatly reduces the risk for alcoholism.\nA genome-wide association study of more than 100,000 human individuals identified variants of the gene \"KLB\", which encodes the transmembrane protein \u03b2-Klotho, as highly associated with alcohol consumption. The protein \u03b2-Klotho is an essential element in cell surface receptors for hormones involved in modulation of appetites for simple sugars and alcohol. A GWAS has found differences in the genetics of alcohol consumption and alcohol dependence, although the two are to some degree related.\nDiagnosis.\nDefinition.\nMisuse, problem use, abuse, and heavy use of alcohol refer to improper use of alcohol, which may cause physical, social, or moral harm to the drinker. \"The Dietary Guidelines for Americans\" defines \"moderate use\" as no more than two alcoholic beverages a day for men and no more than one alcoholic beverage a day for women. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines binge drinking as the amount of alcohol leading to a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.08, which, for most adults, would be reached by consuming five drinks for men or four for women over a two-hour period. According to the NIAAA, men may be at risk for alcohol-related problems if their alcohol consumption exceeds 14 standard drinks per week or 4 drinks per day, and women may be at risk if they have more than 7 standard drinks per week or 3 drinks per day. It defines a standard drink as one 12-ounce bottle of beer, one 5-ounce glass of wine, or 1.5\u00a0ounces of distilled spirits. Despite this risk, a 2014 report in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that only 10% of either \"heavy drinkers\" or \"binge drinkers\" defined according to the above criteria also met the criteria for alcohol dependence, while only 1.3% of non-binge drinkers met the criteria. An inference drawn from this study is that evidence-based policy strategies and clinical preventive services may effectively reduce binge drinking without requiring addiction treatment in most cases.\nAlcoholism.\nThe term \"alcoholism\" is commonly used amongst laypeople, but the word is poorly defined. Despite the imprecision inherent in the term, there have been attempts to define how the word \"alcoholism\" should be interpreted when encountered. In 1992, it was defined by the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence (NCADD) and ASAM as \"a primary, chronic disease characterized by impaired control over drinking, preoccupation with the drug alcohol, use of alcohol despite adverse consequences, and distortions in thinking.\" MeSH has had an entry for \"alcoholism\" since 1999, and references the 1992 definition.\nThe WHO calls \"alcoholism\" \"a term of long-standing use and variable meaning\", and use of the term was disfavored by a 1979 WHO expert committee.\nIn professional and research contexts, the term \"alcoholism\" is not currently favored, but rather alcohol abuse, alcohol dependence, or alcohol use disorder are used. Talbot (1989) observes that alcoholism in the classical disease model follows a progressive course: if a person continues to drink, their condition will worsen. This will lead to harmful consequences in their life, physically, mentally, emotionally and socially. Johnson (1980) explores the emotional progression of the addict's response to alcohol. He looks at this in four phases. The first two are considered \"normal\" drinking and the last two are viewed as \"typical\" alcoholic drinking. Johnson's four phases consist of:\nDSM and ICD.\nIn the United States, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is the most common diagnostic guide for substance use disorders, whereas most countries use the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) for diagnostic (and other) purposes. The two manuals use similar but not identical nomenclature to classify alcohol problems.\nSocial barriers.\nAttitudes and social stereotypes can create barriers to the detection and treatment of alcohol use disorder. This is more of a barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely to suspect that a woman they know has alcohol use disorder. In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely to suspect that a man they know is an alcoholic.\nScreening.\nScreening is recommended among those over the age of 18. Several tools may be used to detect a loss of control of alcohol use. These tools are mostly self-reports in questionnaire form. Another common theme is a score or tally that sums up the general severity of alcohol use.\nThe CAGE questionnaire, named for its four questions, is one such example that may be used to screen patients quickly in a doctor's office.\nOther tests are sometimes used for the detection of alcohol dependence, such as the Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire, which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the CAGE questionnaire. It helps distinguish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence from one of heavy alcohol use. The Michigan Alcohol Screening Test (MAST) is a screening tool for alcoholism widely used by courts to determine the appropriate sentencing for people convicted of alcohol-related offenses, driving under the influence being the most common. The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), a screening questionnaire developed by the World Health Organization, is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally. Like the CAGE questionnaire, it uses a simple set of questions \u2013 a high score earning a deeper investigation. The Paddington Alcohol Test (PAT) was designed to screen for alcohol-related problems amongst those attending Accident and Emergency departments. It concords well with the AUDIT questionnaire but is administered in a fifth of the time.\nUrine and blood tests.\nThere are reliable tests for the actual use of alcohol, one common test being that of blood alcohol content (BAC). These tests do not differentiate alcoholics from non-alcoholics; however, long-term heavy drinking does have a few recognizable effects on the body, including:\nWith regard to alcoholism, BAC is useful to judge alcohol tolerance, which in turn is a sign of alcoholism. Electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia, hyperuricemia, metabolic acidosis, and respiratory alkalosis are common in alcoholics.\nHowever, none of these blood tests for biological markers is as sensitive as screening questionnaires.\nPrevention.\nThe World Health Organization, the European Union and other regional bodies, national governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies in order to reduce the harm of alcoholism. Increasing the age at which licit drugs that are susceptible to misuse, such as alcohol, can be purchased, and banning or restricting alcohol beverage advertising are common methods to reduce alcohol use among adolescents and young adults in particular. Credible, evidence-based educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol misuse have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol misuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested.\nManagement.\nTreatments are varied because there are multiple perspectives of alcoholism. Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example of this kind of treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. Much of the treatment community for alcoholism supports an abstinence-based zero tolerance approach; however, some prefer a harm-reduction approach.\nDetoxification.\nAlcohol detoxification or 'detox' for alcoholics is an abrupt stop of alcohol drinking coupled with the substitution of drugs, such as benzodiazepines, that have similar effects to prevent alcohol withdrawal. Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients. Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome as well as those who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or alcohol use disorder to reduce the risk of relapse. Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations. Alcoholism has serious adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year of abstinence to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol misuse.\nPsychological.\nVarious forms of group therapy or psychotherapy can be used to deal with underlying psychological issues that are related to alcohol addiction, as well as provide relapse prevention skills. The mutual-help group-counseling approach is one of the most common ways of helping alcoholics maintain sobriety. Alcoholics Anonymous was one of the first organizations formed to provide mutual, nonprofessional counseling, and it is still the largest. Others include LifeRing Secular Recovery, SMART Recovery, Women for Sobriety, and Secular Organizations for Sobriety. Alcoholics Anonymous and twelve-step programs appear more effective than cognitive behavioral therapy or abstinence.\nModerate drinking.\nRationing and moderation programs such as Moderation Management and DrinkWise do not mandate complete abstinence. While most alcoholics are unable to limit their drinking in this way, some return to moderate drinking. A 2002 US study by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) showed that 17.7 percent of individuals diagnosed as alcohol dependent more than one year prior returned to low-risk drinking. This group, however, showed fewer initial symptoms of dependency.\nA follow-up study, using the same subjects that were judged to be in remission in 2001\u20132002, examined the rates of return to problem drinking in 2004\u20132005. The study found abstinence from alcohol was the most stable form of remission for recovering alcoholics. There was also a 1973 study showing chronic alcoholics drinking moderately again, but a 1982 follow-up showed that 95% of subjects were not able to moderately drink over the long term. Another study was a long-term (60 year) follow-up of two groups of alcoholic men which concluded that \"return to controlled drinking rarely persisted for much more than a decade without relapse or evolution into abstinence.\" Internet based measures appear to be useful at least in the short term.\nMedications.\nIn the United States there are four approved medications for alcoholism: acamprosate, two methods of using naltrexone and disulfiram.\nSeveral other drugs are also used and many are under investigation.\nEvidence does not support the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), antipsychotics, or gabapentin.\nDual addictions and dependences.\nAlcoholics may also require treatment for other psychotropic drug addictions and drug dependences. The most common dual dependence syndrome with alcohol dependence is benzodiazepine dependence, with studies showing 10\u201320 percent of alcohol-dependent individuals had problems of dependence and/or misuse problems of benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam or clonazepam. These drugs are, like alcohol, depressants. Benzodiazepines may be used legally, if they are prescribed by doctors for anxiety problems or other mood disorders, or they may be purchased as illegal drugs. Benzodiazepine use increases cravings for alcohol and the volume of alcohol consumed by problem drinkers. Benzodiazepine dependency requires careful reduction in dosage to avoid benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome and other health consequences. Dependence on other sedative-hypnotics such as zolpidem and zopiclone as well as opiates and illegal drugs is common in alcoholics. Alcohol itself is a sedative-hypnotic and is cross-tolerant with other sedative-hypnotics such as barbiturates, benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepines. Dependence upon and withdrawal from sedative-hypnotics can be medically severe and, as with alcohol withdrawal, there is a risk of psychosis or seizures if not properly managed.\nEpidemiology.\nThe World Health Organization estimates that as of 2016 there are 380\u00a0million people with alcoholism worldwide (5.1% of the population over 15 years of age). Substance use disorders are a major public health problem facing many countries. \"The most common substance of abuse/dependence in patients presenting for treatment is alcohol.\" In the United Kingdom, the number of 'dependent drinkers' was calculated as over 2.8\u00a0million in 2001. About 12% of American adults have had an alcohol dependence problem at some time in their life. In the United States and Western Europe, 10 to 20 percent of men and 5 to 10 percent of women at some point in their lives will meet criteria for alcoholism. Estonia had the highest death rate from alcohol in Europe in 2015 at 8.8 per 100,000 population. In the United States, 30% of people admitted to hospital have a problem related to alcohol.\nWithin the medical and scientific communities, there is a broad consensus regarding alcoholism as a disease state. For example, the American Medical Association considers alcohol a drug and states that \"drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite often devastating consequences. It results from a complex interplay of biological vulnerability, environmental exposure, and developmental factors (e.g., stage of brain maturity).\" Alcoholism has a higher prevalence among men, though, in recent decades, the proportion of female alcoholics has increased. Current evidence indicates that in both men and women, alcoholism is 50\u201360 percent genetically determined, leaving 40\u201350 percent for environmental influences. Most alcoholics develop alcoholism during adolescence or young adulthood.\nPrognosis.\nAlcoholism often reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years. The most common cause of death in alcoholics is from cardiovascular complications. There is a high rate of suicide in chronic alcoholics, which increases the longer a person drinks. Approximately 3\u201315 percent of alcoholics commit suicide, and research has found that over 50 percent of all suicides are associated with alcohol or drug dependence. This is believed to be due to alcohol causing physiological distortion of brain chemistry, as well as social isolation. Suicide is also very common in adolescent alcohol abusers, with 25 percent of suicides in adolescents being related to alcohol abuse. Among those with alcohol dependence after one year, some met the criteria for low-risk drinking, even though only 25.5 percent of the group received any treatment, with the breakdown as follows: 25 percent were found to be still dependent, 27.3 percent were in partial remission (some symptoms persist), 11.8 percent asymptomatic drinkers (consumption increases chances of relapse) and 35.9 percent were fully recovered\u00a0\u2013 made up of 17.7 percent low-risk drinkers plus 18.2 percent abstainers. In contrast, however, the results of a long-term (60-year) follow-up of two groups of alcoholic men indicated that \"return to controlled drinking rarely persisted for much more than a decade without relapse or evolution into abstinence.\" There was also \"return-to-controlled drinking, as reported in short-term studies, is often a mirage.\"\nHistory.\nHistorically the name \"dipsomania\" was coined by German physician C.W. Hufeland in 1819 before it was superseded by \"alcoholism\". That term now has a more specific meaning. The term \"alcoholism\" was first used in 1849 by the Swedish physician Magnus Huss to describe the systematic adverse effects of alcohol.\nAlcohol has a long history of use and misuse throughout recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its misuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In the 1910s and 1920s, the effects of alcohol misuse and chronic drunkenness boosted membership of the temperance movement and led to the prohibition of alcohol in many Western countries, nationwide bans on the production, importation, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages that generally remained in place until the late 1920s or early 1930s; these policies resulted in the decline of death rates from cirrhosis and alcoholism. In 2005, alcohol dependence and misuse was estimated to cost the US economy approximately 220\u00a0billion dollars per year, more than cancer and obesity.\nSociety and culture.\nThe various health problems associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and secondary treatment costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for head injuries, motor vehicle injuriess (27%), interpersonal violence (18%), suicides (18%), and epilepsy (13%). Beyond the financial costs that alcohol consumption imposes, there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends. For instance, alcohol consumption by a pregnant woman can lead to an incurable and damaging condition known as fetal alcohol syndrome, which often results in cognitive deficits, mental health problems, an inability to live independently and an increased risk of criminal behaviour, all of which can cause emotional stress for parents and caregivers. Estimates of the economic costs of alcohol misuse, collected by the World Health Organization, vary from one to six percent of a country's GDP. One Australian estimate pegged alcohol's social costs at 24% of all drug misuse costs; a similar Canadian study concluded alcohol's share was 41%. One study quantified the cost to the UK of \"all\" forms of alcohol misuse in 2001 as \u00a318.5\u201320\u00a0billion. All economic costs in the United States in 2006 have been estimated at $223.5\u00a0billion.\nThe idea of hitting rock bottom refers to an experience of stress that is attributed to alcohol misuse. \u00a0There is no single definition for this idea, and people may identify their own lowest points in terms of lost jobs, lost relationships, health problems, legal problems, or other consequences of alcohol misuse. \u00a0The concept is promoted by 12-step recovery groups and researchers using the transtheoretical model of motivation for behavior change. \u00a0The first use of this slang phrase in the formal medical literature appeared in a 1965 review in the \"British Medical Journal\", which said that some men refused treatment until they \"hit rock bottom\", but that treatment was generally more successful for \"the alcohol addict who has friends and family to support him\" than for impoverished and homeless addicts.\nStereotypes of alcoholics are often found in fiction and popular culture. The \"town drunk\" is a stock character in Western popular culture. Stereotypes of drunkenness may be based on racism or xenophobia, as in the fictional depiction of the Irish as heavy drinkers. Studies by social psychologists Stivers and Greeley attempt to document the perceived prevalence of high alcohol consumption amongst the Irish in America. Alcohol consumption is relatively similar between many European cultures, the United States, and Australia. In Asian countries that have a high gross domestic product, there is heightened drinking compared to other Asian countries, but it is nowhere near as high as it is in other countries like the United States. It is also inversely seen, with countries that have very low gross domestic product showing high alcohol consumption. In a study done on Korean immigrants in Canada, they reported alcohol was even an integral part of their meal, and is the only time solo drinking should occur. They also believe alcohol is necessary at any social event as it helps conversations start.\nCaucasians have a much lower abstinence rate (11.8%) and much higher tolerance to symptoms (3.4\u00b12.45 drinks) of alcohol than the Chinese (33.4% and 2.2\u00b11.78 drinks respectively). Also, the more acculturation there is between cultures, the more influenced the culture is to adopt Caucasians drinking practices. Peyote, a psychoactive agent, has even shown promise in treating alcoholism. Alcohol had actually replaced peyote as Native Americans\u2019 psychoactive agent of choice in rituals when peyote was outlawed."}

{"id": "2972", "revid": "12406635", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2972", "title": "Abstraction", "text": "Abstraction in its main sense is a conceptual process where general rules and concepts are derived from the usage and classification of specific examples, literal (\"real\" or \"concrete\") signifiers, first principles, or other methods.\n\"An abstraction\" is the outcome of this process\u2014a concept that acts as a common noun for all subordinate concepts, and connects any related concepts as a \"group\", \"field\", or \"category\".\nConceptual abstractions may be formed by filtering the information content of a concept or an observable phenomenon, selecting only the aspects which are relevant for a particular subjectively valued purpose. For example, abstracting a leather soccer ball to the more general idea of a ball selects only the information on general ball attributes and behavior, excluding, but not eliminating, the other phenomenal and cognitive characteristics of that particular ball. In a type\u2013token distinction, a type (e.g., a 'ball') is more abstract than its tokens (e.g., 'that leather soccer ball').\nAbstraction in its secondary use is a material process, discussed in the themes below.\nOrigins.\nThinking in abstractions is considered by anthropologists, archaeologists, and sociologists to be one of the key traits in modern human behaviour, which is believed to have developed between 50,000 and 100,000 years ago. Its development is likely to have been closely connected with the development of human language, which (whether spoken or written) appears to both involve and facilitate abstract thinking.\nHistory.\n\"Abstraction\" involves induction of ideas or the synthesis of particular facts into one general theory about something. It is the opposite of \"specification\", which is the analysis or breaking-down of a general idea or abstraction into concrete facts. Abstraction can be illustrated with Francis Bacon's \"Novum Organum\" (1620), a book of modern scientific philosophy written in the late Jacobean era of England to encourage modern thinkers to collect specific facts before making any generalizations.\nBacon used and promoted induction as an abstraction tool, and it countered the ancient deductive-thinking approach that had dominated the intellectual world since the times of Greek philosophers like Thales, Anaximander, and Aristotle. Thales (c. 624\u2013546 BCE) believed that everything in the universe comes from one main substance, water. He deduced or specified from a general idea, \"everything is water\", to the specific forms of water such as ice, snow, fog, and rivers.\nModern scientists can also use the opposite approach of abstraction, or going from particular facts collected into one general idea, such as the motion of the planets (Newton (1642\u20131727)). When determining that the sun is the center of our solar system (Copernicus (1473\u20131543)), scientists had to utilize thousands of measurements to finally conclude that Mars moves in an elliptical orbit about the sun (Kepler (1571\u20131630)), or to assemble multiple specific facts into the law of falling bodies (Galileo (1564\u20131642)).\nThemes.\nCompression.\nAn abstraction can be seen as a compression process, mapping multiple different pieces of constituent data to a single piece of abstract data; based on similarities in the constituent data, for example, many different physical cats map to the abstraction \"CAT\". This conceptual scheme emphasizes the inherent equality of both constituent and abstract data, thus avoiding problems arising from the distinction between \"abstract\" and \"concrete\". In this sense the process of abstraction entails the identification of similarities between objects, and the process of associating these objects with an abstraction (which is itself an object).\nChains of abstractions can be construed, moving from neural impulses arising from sensory perception to basic abstractions such as color or shape, to experiential abstractions such as a specific cat, to semantic abstractions such as the \"idea\" of a CAT, to classes of objects such as \"mammals\" and even categories such as \"object\" as opposed to \"action\".\nInstantiation.\nNon-existent things in any particular place and time are often seen as abstract. By contrast, instances, or members, of such an abstract thing might exist in many different places and times.\nThose abstract things are then said to be \"multiply instantiated\", in the sense of \"picture 1\", \"picture 2\", etc., shown below. It is not sufficient, however, to define \"abstract\" ideas as those that can be instantiated and to define \"abstraction\" as the movement in the opposite direction to instantiation. Doing so would make the concepts \"cat\" and \"telephone\" abstract ideas since despite their varying appearances, a particular cat or a particular telephone is an instance of the concept \"cat\" or the concept \"telephone\". Although the concepts \"cat\" and \"telephone\" are \"abstractions\", they are not \"abstract\" in the sense of the objects in \"graph 1\" below. We might look at other graphs, in a progression from \"cat\" to \"mammal\" to \"animal\", and see that \"animal\" is more abstract than \"mammal\"; but on the other hand \"mammal\" is a harder idea to express, certainly in relation to \"marsupial\" or \"monotreme\".\nPerhaps confusingly, some philosophies refer to \"tropes\" (instances of properties) as \"abstract particulars\"\u2014e.g., the particular redness of a particular apple is an \"abstract particular\". This is similar to qualia and sumbebekos.\nMaterial process.\nStill retaining the primary meaning of 'abstrere' or 'to draw away from', the abstraction of money, for example, works by drawing away from the particular value of things allowing completely incommensurate objects to be compared (see the section on 'Physicality' below). Karl Marx's writing on the commodity abstraction recognizes a parallel process.\nThe state (polity) as both concept and material practice exemplifies the two sides of this process of abstraction. Conceptually, 'the current concept of the state is an abstraction from the much more concrete early-modern use as the standing or status of the prince, his visible estates'. At the same time, materially, the 'practice of statehood is now constitutively and materially more abstract than at the time when princes ruled as the embodiment of extended power'. \nOntological status.\nThe way that physical objects, like rocks and trees, have being differs from the way that properties of abstract concepts or relations have being, for example the way the concrete, particular, individuals pictured in \"picture 1\" exist differs from the way the concepts illustrated in \"graph 1\" exist. That difference accounts for the ontological usefulness of the word \"abstract\". The word applies to properties and relations to mark the fact that, if they exist, they do not exist in space or time, but that instances of them can exist, potentially in many different places and times.\nPhysicality.\nA physical object (a possible referent of a concept or word) is considered \"concrete\" (not abstract) if it is a \"particular individual\" that occupies a particular place and time. However, in the secondary sense of the term 'abstraction', this physical object can carry materially abstracting processes. For example, record-keeping aids throughout the Fertile Crescent included calculi (clay spheres, cones, etc.) which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in containers. According to , these clay containers contained tokens, the total of which were the count of objects being transferred. The containers thus served as something of a bill of lading or an accounts book. In order to avoid breaking open the containers for the count, marks were placed on the outside of the containers. These physical marks, in other words, acted as material abstractions of a materially abstract process of accounting, using conceptual abstractions (numbers) to communicate its meaning.\nAbstract things are sometimes defined as those things that do not exist in reality or exist only as sensory experiences, like the color red. That definition, however, suffers from the difficulty of deciding which things are real (i.e. which things exist in reality). For example, it is difficult to agree to whether concepts like \"God\", \"the number three\", and \"goodness\" are real, abstract, or both.\nAn approach to resolving such difficulty is to use \"predicates\" as a general term for whether things are variously real, abstract, concrete, or of a particular property (e.g., \"good\"). Questions about the properties of things are then propositions about predicates, which propositions remain to be evaluated by the investigator. In the \"graph 1\" below, the graphical relationships like the arrows joining boxes and ellipses might denote predicates.\nReferencing and referring.\nAbstractions sometimes have ambiguous referents; for example, \"happiness\" (when used as an abstraction) can refer to as many things as there are people and events or states of being which make them happy. Likewise, \"architecture\" refers not only to the design of safe, functional buildings, but also to elements of creation and innovation which aim at elegant solutions to construction problems, to the use of space, and to the attempt to evoke an emotional response in the builders, owners, viewers and users of the building.\nSimplification and ordering.\nAbstraction uses a strategy of simplification, wherein formerly concrete details are left ambiguous, vague, or undefined; thus effective communication about things in the abstract requires an intuitive or common experience between the communicator and the communication recipient. This is true for all verbal/abstract communication.\nFor example, many different things can be red. Likewise, many things sit on surfaces (as in \"picture 1\", to the right). The property of \"redness\" and the relation \"sitting-on\" are therefore abstractions of those objects. Specifically, the conceptual diagram \"graph 1\" identifies only three boxes, two ellipses, and four arrows (and their five labels), whereas the \"picture 1\" shows much more pictorial detail, with the scores of implied relationships as implicit in the picture rather than with the nine explicit details in the graph.\n\"Graph 1\" details some explicit relationships between the objects of the diagram. For example, the arrow between the \"agent\" and \"CAT:Elsie\" depicts an example of an \"is-a\" relationship, as does the arrow between the \"location\" and the \"MAT\". The arrows between the gerund/present participle \"SITTING\" and the nouns \"agent\" and \"location\" express the diagram's basic relationship; \"agent is SITTING on location\"; \"Elsie\" is an instance of \"CAT\".\nAlthough the description \"sitting-on\" (graph 1) is more abstract than the graphic image of a cat sitting on a mat (picture 1), the delineation of abstract things from concrete things is somewhat ambiguous; this ambiguity or vagueness is characteristic of abstraction. Thus something as simple as a newspaper might be specified to six levels, as in Douglas Hofstadter's illustration of that ambiguity, with a progression from abstract to concrete in \"G\u00f6del, Escher, Bach\" (1979):\nAn abstraction can thus encapsulate each of these levels of detail with no loss of generality. But perhaps a detective or philosopher/scientist/engineer might seek to learn about something, at progressively deeper levels of detail, to solve a crime or a puzzle.\nThought processes.\nIn philosophical terminology, \"abstraction\" is the thought process wherein ideas are distanced from objects.\nAs used in different disciplines.\nIn art.\nTypically, \"abstraction\" is used in the arts as a synonym for abstract art in general. Strictly speaking, it refers to art unconcerned with the literal depiction of things from the visible world\u2014it can, however, refer to an object or image which has been distilled from the real world, or indeed, another work of art. Artwork that reshapes the natural world for expressive purposes is called abstract; that which derives from, but does not imitate a recognizable subject is called nonobjective abstraction. In the 20th century the trend toward abstraction coincided with advances in science, technology, and changes in urban life, eventually reflecting an interest in psychoanalytic theory. Later still, abstraction was manifest in more purely formal terms, such as color, freedom from objective context, and a reduction of form to basic geometric designs.\nIn computer science.\nComputer scientists use abstraction to make models that can be used and re-used without having to re-write all the program code for each new application on every different type of computer. They communicate their solutions with the computer by writing source code in some particular computer language which can be translated into machine code for different types of computers to execute. Abstraction allows program designers to separate a framework (categorical concepts related to computing problems) from specific instances which implement details. This means that the program code can be written so that code doesn't have to depend on the specific details of supporting applications, operating system software, or hardware, but on a categorical concept of the solution. A solution to the problem can then be integrated into the system framework with minimal additional work. This allows programmers to take advantage of another programmer's work, while requiring only an abstract understanding of the implementation of another's work, apart from the problem that it solves.\nIn general semantics.\nAbstractions and levels of abstraction play an important role in the theory of general semantics originated by Alfred Korzybski. Anatol Rapoport wrote: \"Abstracting is a mechanism by which an infinite variety of experiences can be mapped on short noises (words).\"\nIn history.\nFrancis Fukuyama defines history as \"a deliberate attempt of abstraction in which we separate out important from unimportant events\".\nIn linguistics.\nResearchers in linguistics frequently apply abstraction so as to allow analysis of the phenomena of language at the desired level of detail. A commonly used abstraction, the \"phoneme\", abstracts speech sounds in such a way as to neglect details that cannot serve to differentiate meaning. Other analogous kinds of abstractions (sometimes called \"emic units\") considered by linguists include morphemes, graphemes, and lexemes.\nAbstraction also arises in the relation between syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. Pragmatics involves considerations that make reference to the user of the language; semantics considers expressions and what they denote (the designata) abstracted from the language user; and syntax considers only the expressions themselves, abstracted from the designata.\nIn mathematics.\nAbstraction in mathematics is the process of extracting the underlying structures, patterns or properties of a mathematical concept or object, removing any dependence on real world objects with which it might originally have been connected, and generalizing it so that it has wider applications or matching among other abstract descriptions of equivalent phenomena.\nThe advantages of abstraction in mathematics are:\nThe main disadvantage of abstraction is that highly abstract concepts are more difficult to learn, and might require a degree of mathematical maturity and experience before they can be assimilated.\nIn music.\nIn music, the term \"abstraction\" can be used to describe improvisatory approaches to interpretation, and may sometimes indicate abandonment of tonality. Atonal music has no key signature, and is characterized by the exploration of internal numeric relationships.\nIn neurology.\nA recent meta-analysis suggests that the verbal system has greater engagement for abstract concepts when the perceptual system is more engaged for processing of concrete concepts. This is because abstract concepts elicit greater brain activity in the inferior frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus compared to concrete concepts which elicit greater activity in the posterior cingulate, precuneus, fusiform gyrus, and parahippocampal gyrus. Other research into the human brain suggests that the left and right hemispheres differ in their handling of abstraction. For example, one meta-analysis reviewing human brain lesions has shown a left hemisphere bias during tool usage.\nIn philosophy.\nAbstraction in philosophy is the process (or, to some, the alleged process) in concept formation of recognizing some set of common features in individuals, and on that basis forming a concept of that feature. The notion of abstraction is important to understanding some philosophical controversies surrounding empiricism and the problem of universals. It has also recently become popular in formal logic under predicate abstraction. Another philosophical tool for discussion of abstraction is thought space.\nJohn Locke defined abstraction in \"An Essay Concerning Human Understanding\":\n'So words are used to stand as outward marks of our internal ideas, which are taken from particular things; but if every particular idea that we take in had its own special name, there would be no end to names. To prevent this, the mind makes particular ideas received from particular things become general; which it does by considering them as they are in the mind\u2014mental appearances\u2014separate from all other existences, and from the circumstances of real existence, such as time, place, and so on. This procedure is called abstraction. In it, an idea taken from a particular thing becomes a general representative of all of the same kind, and its name becomes a general name that is applicable to any existing thing that fits that abstract idea.' (2.11.9)\nIn psychology.\nCarl Jung's definition of abstraction broadened its scope beyond the thinking process to include exactly four mutually exclusive, different complementary psychological functions: sensation, intuition, feeling, and thinking. Together they form a structural totality of the differentiating abstraction process. Abstraction operates in one of these functions when it excludes the simultaneous influence of the other functions and other irrelevancies, such as emotion. Abstraction requires selective use of this structural split of abilities in the psyche. The opposite of abstraction is concretism. \"Abstraction\" is one of Jung's 57 definitions in Chapter XI of \"Psychological Types\".\nThere is an abstract \"thinking\", just as there is abstract \"feeling\", \"sensation\" and \"intuition\". Abstract thinking singles out the rational, logical qualities ... Abstract feeling does the same with ... its feeling-values. ... I put abstract feelings on the same level as abstract thoughts. ... Abstract sensation would be aesthetic as opposed to sensuous \"sensation\" and abstract intuition would be symbolic as opposed to fantastic \"intuition\". (Jung, [1921] (1971): par. 678).\nIn social theory.\nIn social theory, abstraction is used as both an ideational and material process. Alfred Sohn-Rethel, asked \"Can there be abstraction other than by thought?\" He used the example of commodity abstraction to show that abstraction occurs in practice as people create systems of abstract exchange that extend beyond the immediate physicality of the object and yet have real and immediate consequences. This work was extended through the 'Constitutive Abstraction' approach of writers associated with the Journal \"Arena\". Two books that have taken this theme of the abstraction of social relations as an organizing process in human history are \"Nation Formation: Towards a Theory of Abstract Community\" (1996) and the second volume published in 2006, \"Globalism, Nationalism, Tribalism: Bringing Theory Back In\". These books argue that the nation is an abstract community bringing together strangers who will never meet as such; thus constituting materially real and substantial, but abstracted and mediated relations. The books suggest that contemporary processes of globalization and mediatization have contributed to materially abstracting relations between people, with major consequences for how we live our lives.\nIt can be easily argued that abstraction is an elementary methodological tool in several disciplines of social science. These disciplines have definite and different man concepts that highlight those aspects of man and his behaviour by idealization that are relevant for the given human science. For example, is the man as sociology abstracts and idealizes it, depicting man as a social being. Moreover, we could talk about (the man who can extend his biologically determined intelligence thanks to new technologies), or (who is simply creative).\nAbstraction (combined with Weberian idealization) plays a crucial role in economics. Breaking away from directly experienced reality was a common trend in 19th century sciences (especially physics), and this was the effort which was fundamentally determined the way economics tried and still tries to approach the economic aspects of social life. It is abstraction we meet in the case of both Newton's physics and the neoclassical theory, since the goal was to grasp the unchangeable and timeless essence of phenomena. For example, Newton created the concept of the material point by following the abstraction method so that he abstracted from the dimension and shape of any perceptible object, preserving only inertial and translational motion. Material point is the ultimate and common feature of all bodies. Neoclassical economists created the indefinitely abstract notion of homo economicus by following the same procedure. Economists abstract from all individual and personal qualities in order to get to those characteristics that embody the essence of economic activity. Eventually, it is the substance of the economic man that they try to grasp. Any characteristic beyond it only disturbs the functioning of this essential core."}

That is, the group operation is commutative. With addition as an operation, the integers and the real numbers form abelian groups, and the concept of an abelian group may be viewed as a generalization of these examples. Abelian groups are named after early 19th century mathematician Niels Henrik Abel.\nThe concept of an abelian group underlies many fundamental algebraic structures, such as fields, rings, vector spaces, and algebras. The theory of abelian groups is generally simpler than that of their non-abelian counterparts, and finite abelian groups are very well understood and fully classified.\nDefinition.\nAn abelian group is a set, formula_1, together with an operation formula_2 that combines any two elements formula_3 and formula_4 of formula_1 to form another element of formula_6 denoted formula_7. The symbol formula_2 is a general placeholder for a concretely given operation. To qualify as an abelian group, the set and operation, formula_9, must satisfy five requirements known as the \"abelian group axioms\":\nA group in which the group operation is not commutative is called a \"non-abelian group\" or \"non-commutative group\".\nFacts.\nNotation.\nThere are two main notational conventions for abelian groups \u2013 additive and multiplicative.\nGenerally, the multiplicative notation is the usual notation for groups, while the additive notation is the usual notation for modules and rings. The additive notation may also be used to emphasize that a particular group is abelian, whenever both abelian and non-abelian groups are considered, some notable exceptions being near-rings and partially ordered groups, where an operation is written additively even when non-abelian.\nMultiplication table.\nTo verify that a finite group is abelian, a table (matrix) \u2013 known as a Cayley table \u2013 can be constructed in a similar fashion to a multiplication table. If the group is formula_35 under the the entry of this table contains the product formula_36.\nThe group is abelian if and only if this table is symmetric about the main diagonal. This is true since the group is abelian iff formula_37 for all formula_38, which is iff the formula_39 entry of the table equals the formula_40 entry for all formula_38, i.e. the table is symmetric about the main diagonal.\nExamples.\nIn general, matrices, even invertible matrices, do not form an abelian group under multiplication because matrix multiplication is generally not commutative. However, some groups of matrices are abelian groups under matrix multiplication \u2013 one example is the group of formula_60 rotation matrices.\nHistorical remarks.\nCamille Jordan named abelian groups after Norwegian mathematician Niels Henrik Abel, because Abel found that the commutativity of the group of a polynomial implies that the roots of the polynomial can be calculated by using radicals.\nProperties.\nIf formula_44 is a natural number and formula_50 is an element of an abelian group formula_49 written additively, then formula_64 can be defined as formula_65 (formula_44 summands) and formula_67. In this way, formula_49 becomes a module over the ring formula_54 of integers. In fact, the modules over formula_54 can be identified with the abelian groups.\nTheorems about abelian groups (i.e. modules over the principal ideal domain formula_54) can often be generalized to theorems about modules over an arbitrary principal ideal domain. A typical example is the classification of finitely generated abelian groups which is a specialization of the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain. In the case of finitely generated abelian groups, this theorem guarantees that an abelian group splits as a direct sum of a torsion group and a free abelian group. The former may be written as a direct sum of finitely many groups of the form formula_72 for formula_73 prime, and the latter is a direct sum of finitely many copies of formula_54.\nIf formula_75 are two group homomorphisms between abelian groups, then their sum formula_76, defined by formula_77, is again a homomorphism. (This is not true if formula_78 is a non-abelian group.) The set formula_79 of all group homomorphisms from formula_49 to formula_78 is therefore an abelian group in its own right.\nSomewhat akin to the dimension of vector spaces, every abelian group has a \"rank\". It is defined as the maximal cardinality of a set of linearly independent (over the integers) elements of the group. Finite abelian groups and torsion groups have rank zero, and every abelian group of rank zero is a torsion group. The integers and the rational numbers have rank one, as well as every nonzero additive subgroup of the rationals. On the other hand, the multiplicative group of the nonzero rationals has an infinite rank, as it is a free abelian group with the set of the prime numbers as a basis (this results from the fundamental theorem of arithmetic).\nThe center formula_82 of a group formula_49 is the set of elements that commute with every element of formula_49. A group formula_49 is abelian if and only if it is equal to its center formula_82. The center of a group formula_49 is always a characteristic abelian subgroup of formula_49. If the quotient group formula_89 of a group by its center is cyclic then formula_49 is abelian.\nFinite abelian groups.\nCyclic groups of integers modulo formula_44, formula_92, were among the first examples of groups. It turns out that an arbitrary finite abelian group is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups of prime power order, and these orders are uniquely determined, forming a complete system of invariants. The automorphism group of a finite abelian group can be described directly in terms of these invariants. The theory had been first developed in the 1879 paper of Georg Frobenius and Ludwig Stickelberger and later was both simplified and generalized to finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain, forming an important chapter of linear algebra.\nAny group of prime order is isomorphic to a cyclic group and therefore abelian. Any group whose order is a square of a prime number is also abelian. In fact, for every prime number formula_73 there are (up to isomorphism) exactly two groups of order formula_94, namely formula_95 and formula_96.\nClassification.\nThe fundamental theorem of finite abelian groups states that every finite abelian group formula_49 can be expressed as the direct sum of cyclic subgroups of prime-power order; it is also known as the basis theorem for finite abelian groups. Moreover, automorphism groups of cyclic groups are examples of abelian groups. This is generalized by the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups, with finite groups being the special case when \"G\" has zero rank; this in turn admits numerous further generalizations.\nThe classification was proven by Leopold Kronecker in 1870, though it was not stated in modern group-theoretic terms until later, and was preceded by a similar classification of quadratic forms by Carl Friedrich Gauss in 1801; see history for details.\nThe cyclic group formula_98 of order formula_99 is isomorphic to the direct sum of formula_100 and formula_101 if and only if formula_47 and formula_44 are coprime. It follows that any finite abelian group formula_49 is isomorphic to a direct sum of the form\nin either of the following canonical ways:\nFor example, formula_111 can be expressed as the direct sum of two cyclic subgroups of order 3 and 5: formula_112. The same can be said for any abelian group of order 15, leading to the remarkable conclusion that all abelian groups of order 15 are isomorphic.\nFor another example, every abelian group of order 8 is isomorphic to either formula_113 (the integers 0 to 7 under addition modulo 8), formula_114 (the odd integers 1 to 15 under multiplication modulo 16), or formula_115.\nSee also list of small groups for finite abelian groups of order 30 or less.\nAutomorphisms.\nOne can apply the fundamental theorem to count (and sometimes determine) the automorphisms of a given finite abelian group formula_49. To do this, one uses the fact that if formula_49 splits as a direct sum formula_118 of subgroups of coprime order, then\nGiven this, the fundamental theorem shows that to compute the automorphism group of formula_49 it suffices to compute the automorphism groups of the Sylow formula_73-subgroups separately (that is, all direct sums of cyclic subgroups, each with order a power of formula_73). Fix a prime formula_73 and suppose the exponents formula_124 of the cyclic factors of the Sylow formula_73-subgroup are arranged in increasing order:\nfor some formula_127. One needs to find the automorphisms of\nOne special case is when formula_129, so that there is only one cyclic prime-power factor in the Sylow formula_73-subgroup formula_131. In this case the theory of automorphisms of a finite cyclic group can be used. Another special case is when formula_44 is arbitrary but formula_133 for formula_134. Here, one is considering formula_131 to be of the form\nso elements of this subgroup can be viewed as comprising a vector space of dimension formula_44 over the finite field of formula_73 elements formula_139. The automorphisms of this subgroup are therefore given by the invertible linear transformations, so\nwhere formula_141 is the appropriate general linear group. This is easily shown to have order\nIn the most general case, where the formula_124 and formula_44 are arbitrary, the automorphism group is more difficult to determine. It is known, however, that if one defines\nand\nthen one has in particular formula_147, formula_148, and\nOne can check that this yields the orders in the previous examples as special cases (see Hillar, C., &amp; Rhea, D.).\nFinitely generated abelian groups.\nAn abelian group is finitely generated if it contains a finite set of elements (called \"generators\") formula_150 such that every element of the group is a linear combination with integer coefficients of elements of . \nLet be a free abelian group with basis formula_151 \nThere is a unique group homomorphism\nformula_152 such that \nThis homomorphism is surjective, and its kernel is finitely generated (since integers form a Noetherian ring). Consider the matrix with integer entries, such that the entries of its th column are the coefficients of the th generator of the kernel. Then, the abelian group is isomorphic to the cokernel of linear map defined by . Conversely every integer matrix defines a finitely generated abelian group.\nIt follows that the study of finitely generated abelian groups is totally equivalent with the study of integer matrices. In particular, changing the generating set of is equivalent with multiplying on the left by a unimodular matrix (that is, an invertible integer matrix whose inverse is also an integer matrix). Changing the generating set of the kernel of is equivalent with multiplying on the right by a unimodular matrix.\nThe Smith normal form of is a matrix\nwhere and are unimodular, and is a matrix such that all non-diagonal entries are zero, the non-zero diagonal entries are the first ones, and is a divisor of for . The existence and the shape of the Smith normal proves that the finitely generated abelian group is the direct sum \nwhere is the number of zero rows at the bottom of (and also the rank of the group). This is the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups.\nThe existence of algorithms for Smith normal form shows that the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups is not only a theorem of abstract existence, but provides a way for computing expression of finitely generated abelian groups as direct sums.\nInfinite abelian groups.\nThe simplest infinite abelian group is the infinite cyclic group formula_54. Any finitely generated abelian group formula_1 is isomorphic to the direct sum of formula_158 copies of formula_54 and a finite abelian group, which in turn is decomposable into a direct sum of finitely many cyclic groups of prime power orders. Even though the decomposition is not unique, the number formula_158, called the rank of formula_1, and the prime powers giving the orders of finite cyclic summands are uniquely determined.\nBy contrast, classification of general infinitely generated abelian groups is far from complete. Divisible groups, i.e. abelian groups formula_1 in which the equation formula_163 admits a solution formula_164 for any natural number formula_44 and element formula_3 of formula_1, constitute one important class of infinite abelian groups that can be completely characterized. Every divisible group is isomorphic to a direct sum, with summands isomorphic to formula_168 and Pr\u00fcfer groups formula_169 for various prime numbers formula_73, and the cardinality of the set of summands of each type is uniquely determined. Moreover, if a divisible group formula_1 is a subgroup of an abelian group formula_49 then formula_1 admits a direct complement: a subgroup formula_174 of formula_49 such that formula_176. Thus divisible groups are injective modules in the category of abelian groups, and conversely, every injective abelian group is divisible (Baer's criterion). An abelian group without non-zero divisible subgroups is called reduced.\nTwo important special classes of infinite abelian groups with diametrically opposite properties are \"torsion groups\" and \"torsion-free groups\", exemplified by the groups formula_177 (periodic) and formula_168 (torsion-free).\nTorsion groups.\nAn abelian group is called periodic or torsion, if every element has finite order. A direct sum of finite cyclic groups is periodic. Although the converse statement is not true in general, some special cases are known. The first and second Pr\u00fcfer theorems state that if formula_1 is a periodic group, and it either has a bounded exponent, i.e., formula_180 for some natural number formula_44, or is countable and the formula_73-heights of the elements of formula_1 are finite for each formula_73, then formula_1 is isomorphic to a direct sum of finite cyclic groups. \nThe cardinality of the set of direct summands isomorphic to formula_186 in such a decomposition is an invariant of formula_1. These theorems were later subsumed in the Kulikov criterion. In a different direction, Helmut Ulm found an extension of the second Pr\u00fcfer theorem to countable abelian formula_73-groups with elements of infinite height: those groups are completely classified by means of their Ulm invariants.\nTorsion-free and mixed groups.\nAn abelian group is called torsion-free if every non-zero element has infinite order. Several classes of torsion-free abelian groups have been studied extensively:\nAn abelian group that is neither periodic nor torsion-free is called mixed. If formula_1 is an abelian group and formula_192 is its torsion subgroup, then the factor group formula_193 is torsion-free. However, in general the torsion subgroup is not a direct summand of formula_1, so formula_1 is \"not\" isomorphic to formula_196. Thus the theory of mixed groups involves more than simply combining the results about periodic and torsion-free groups. The additive group formula_54 of integers is torsion-free formula_54-module.\nInvariants and classification.\nOne of the most basic invariants of an infinite abelian group formula_1 is its rank: the cardinality of the maximal linearly independent subset of formula_1. Abelian groups of rank 0 are precisely the periodic groups, while torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are necessarily subgroups of formula_168 and can be completely described. More generally, a torsion-free abelian group of finite rank formula_158 is a subgroup of formula_203. On the other hand, the group of formula_73-adic integers formula_205 is a torsion-free abelian group of infinite formula_54-rank and the groups formula_207 with different formula_44 are non-isomorphic, so this invariant does not even fully capture properties of some familiar groups.\nThe classification theorems for finitely generated, divisible, countable periodic, and rank 1 torsion-free abelian groups explained above were all obtained before 1950 and form a foundation of the classification of more general infinite abelian groups. Important technical tools used in classification of infinite abelian groups are pure and basic subgroups. Introduction of various invariants of torsion-free abelian groups has been one avenue of further progress. See the books by Irving Kaplansky, L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Fuchs, Phillip Griffith, and David Arnold, as well as the proceedings of the conferences on Abelian Group Theory published in \"Lecture Notes in Mathematics\" for more recent findings.\nAdditive groups of rings.\nThe additive group of a ring is an abelian group, but not all abelian groups are additive groups of rings (with nontrivial multiplication). Some important topics in this area of study are:\nRelation to other mathematical topics.\nMany large abelian groups possess a natural topology, which turns them into topological groups.\nThe collection of all abelian groups, together with the homomorphisms between them, forms the category formula_209, the prototype of an abelian category.\n proved that the first-order theory of abelian groups, unlike its non-abelian counterpart, is decidable. Most algebraic structures other than Boolean algebras are undecidable.\nThere are still many areas of current research:\nMoreover, abelian groups of infinite order lead, quite surprisingly, to deep questions about the set theory commonly assumed to underlie all of mathematics. Take the Whitehead problem: are all Whitehead groups of infinite order also free abelian groups? In the 1970s, Saharon Shelah proved that the Whitehead problem is:\nA note on the typography.\nAmong mathematical adjectives derived from the proper name of a mathematician, the word \"abelian\" is rare in that it is often spelled with a lowercase a, rather than an uppercase A, the lack of capitalization being a tacit acknowledgement not only of the degree to which Abel's name has been institutionalized but also of how ubiquitous in modern mathematics are the concepts introduced by him."}
{"id": "2975", "revid": "61482", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2975", "title": "Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty", "text": "The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty (ABM Treaty or ABMT) (1972\u20142002) was an arms control treaty between the United States and the Soviet Union on the limitation of the anti-ballistic missile (ABM) systems used in defending areas against ballistic missile-delivered nuclear weapons. Under the terms of the treaty, each party was limited to two ABM complexes, each of which was to be limited to 100 anti-ballistic missiles.\nSigned in 1972, it was in force for the next 30 years. In 1997, five years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, four former Soviet republics agreed with the United States to succeed the USSR's role in the treaty. In June 2002 the United States withdrew from the treaty, leading to its termination.\nBackground.\nThroughout the late 1950s and into the 1960s, the United States and the Soviet Union had been developing missile systems with the ability to shoot down incoming ICBM warheads. During this period, the US considered the defense of the US as part of reducing the overall damage inflicted in a full nuclear exchange. As part of this defense, Canada and the US established the North American Air Defense Command (now called North American Aerospace Defense Command).\nBy the early 1950s, US research on the Nike Zeus missile system had developed to the point where small improvements would allow it to be used as the basis of an operational ABM system. Work started on a short-range, high-speed counterpart known as Sprint to provide defense for the ABM sites themselves. By the mid-1960s, both systems showed enough promise to start development of base selection for a limited ABM system dubbed Sentinel. In 1967, the US announced that Sentinel itself would be scaled down to the smaller and less expensive Safeguard. Soviet doctrine called for development of its own ABM system and return to strategic parity with the US. This was achieved with the operational deployment of the A-35 ABM system and its successors, which remain operational to this day.\nThe development of multiple independently targetable reentry vehicle (MIRV) systems allowed a single ICBM to deliver as many as ten separate warheads at a time. An ABM defense system could be overwhelmed with the sheer number of warheads. Upgrading it to counter the additional warheads would be economically unfeasible: The defenders required one rocket per incoming warhead, whereas the attackers could place 10 warheads on a single missile at a reasonable cost. To further protect against ABM systems, the Soviet MIRV missiles were equipped with decoys; R-36M heavy missiles carried as many as 40. These decoys would appear as warheads to an ABM, effectively requiring engagement of five times as many targets and rendering defense even less effective.\nABM Treaty.\nThe United States first proposed an anti-ballistic missile treaty at the 1967 Glassboro Summit Conference during discussions between U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara and Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union Alexei Kosygin. McNamara argued both that ballistic missile defense could provoke an arms race, and that it might provoke a first-strike against the nation fielding the defense. Kosygin rejected this reasoning. They were trying to minimize the number of nuclear missiles in the world. Following the proposal of the Sentinel and Safeguard decisions on American ABM systems, the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks began in November 1969 (SALT I). By 1972 an agreement had been reached to limit strategic defensive systems. Each country was allowed two sites at which it could base a defensive system, one for the capital and one for ICBM silos.\nThe treaty was signed during the 1972 Moscow Summit on 26 May by the President of the United States, Richard Nixon and the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Leonid Brezhnev; and ratified by the US Senate on 3 August 1972.\nThe 1974 Protocol reduced the number of sites to one per party, largely because neither country had developed a second site. The sites were Moscow for the USSR and the North Dakota Safeguard Complex for the US, which was already under construction.\nMissiles limited by the treaty.\nThe Treaty limited only ABMs capable of defending against \"strategic ballistic missiles\", without attempting to define \"strategic\". It was understood that both ICBMs and SLBMs are obviously \"strategic\". Neither country intended to stop the development of counter-tactical ABMs. The topic became disputable as soon as most potent counter-tactical ABMs started to be capable of shooting down SLBMs (SLBMs naturally tend to be much slower than ICBMs), nevertheless both sides continued counter-tactical ABM development.\nAfter the SDI announcement.\nOn 23 March 1983, Ronald Reagan announced the Strategic Defense Initiative, a research program into ballistic missile defense which would be \"consistent with our obligations under the ABM Treaty\". Reagan was wary of mutual deterrence with what he had recently called an \"Evil Empire\", and wanted to escape the traditional confines of mutual assured destruction. The project was a blow to Yuri Andropov's so-called \"peace offensive\". Andropov said that \"It is time [Washington] stopped thinking up one option after another in search of the best way of unleashing nuclear war in the hope of winning it. To do this is not just irresponsible. It is madness\".\nRegardless of the opposition, Reagan gave every indication that SDI would not be used as a bargaining chip and that the United States would do all in its power to build the system. The Soviets were threatened because the Americans might have been able to make a nuclear first strike possible. In \"The Nuclear Predicament,\" Beckman claims that one of the central goals of Soviet diplomacy was to terminate SDI. A surprise attack from the Americans would destroy much of the Soviet ICBM fleet, allowing SDI to defeat a \"ragged\" Soviet retaliatory response. Furthermore, if the Soviets chose to enter this new arms race, they would further cripple their economy. The Soviets could not afford to ignore Reagan's new endeavor, therefore their policy at the time was to enter negotiations with the Americans. By 1987, however, the USSR withdrew its opposition, concluding the SDI posed no threat and scientifically \"would never work.\"\nSDI research went ahead, although it did not achieve the hoped-for result. SDI research was cut back following the end of Reagan's presidency, and in 1995 it was reiterated in a presidential joint statement that \"missile defense systems may be deployed... [that] will not pose a realistic threat to the strategic nuclear force of the other side and will not be tested to... [create] that capability.\" This was reaffirmed in 1997.\nSuccessor states to Soviet Union agree to continue treaty in force.\nAlthough the Soviet Union ceased to exist in December 1991, in the view of the U.S. Department of State, the treaty continued in force. An additional memorandum of understanding was prepared in 1997, establishing Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine as successor states to the Soviet Union, for the purposes of the treaty.\nUnited States withdrawal.\nOn 13 December 2001, George W. Bush gave Russia notice of the United States' withdrawal from the treaty, in accordance with the clause that required six months' notice before terminating the pact\u2014the first time in recent history that the United States has withdrawn from a major international arms treaty. This led to the eventual creation of the American Missile Defense Agency.\nSupporters of the withdrawal argued that it was a necessity in order to test and build a limited National Missile Defense to protect the United States from nuclear blackmail by a rogue state. The withdrawal also had many critics. John Rhinelander, a negotiator of the ABM treaty, predicted that the withdrawal would be a \"fatal blow\" to the Non-Proliferation Treaty and would lead to a \"world without effective legal constraints on nuclear proliferation.\" The construction of a missile defense system was also feared to enable the US to attack with a nuclear first strike. Former U.S. Secretary of Defense William Perry also criticized the U.S. withdrawal as a very bad decision.\nPutin responded to the withdrawal by ordering a build-up of Russia's nuclear capabilities, designed to counterbalance U.S. capabilities.\nRussia and the United States signed the Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty in Moscow on 24 May 2002. This treaty mandates cuts in deployed strategic nuclear warheads, but without actually mandating cuts to total stockpiled warheads, and without any mechanism for enforcement.\nIn interviews with Oliver Stone in 2017, Russian president Vladimir Putin said that in trying to persuade Russia to accept US withdrawal from the treaty, both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush had tried, without evidence, to convince him of an emerging nuclear threat from Iran.\n2018 statement by Putin on new weapons.\nOn 1 March 2018, Russian president Vladimir Putin, in an address to the Federal Assembly, announced the development of a series of technologically new missile systems and stressed that those were designed as a response to U.S. withdrawal from the ABM Treaty. His statements were referred to by Trump administration officials as largely boastful untruths, but also as confirmation that \"Russia has been developing destabilizing weapons systems for over a decade, in direct violation of its treaty obligations.\""}

{"id": "2983", "revid": "1808194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2983", "title": "Austria-Hungary", "text": "Austria-Hungary, often referred to as the Austro-Hungarian Empire or the Dual Monarchy, was a constitutional monarchy and great power in Central Europe between 1867 and 1918. It was formed with the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 and was dissolved following its defeat in the First World War.\nAt its core was the dual monarchy which was a real union between the Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary. A third component of the union was the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia, an autonomous region under the Hungarian crown, which negotiated the Croatian\u2013Hungarian Settlement in 1868. From 1878 Austria-Hungary jointly governed Bosnia-Hercegovina, which it annexed in 1908. Austria-Hungary was ruled by the House of Habsburg and constituted the last phase in the constitutional evolution of the Habsburg Monarchy. The union was established by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise on 30 March 1867 in the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War. Following the 1867 reforms, the Austrian and Hungarian states were co-equal in power. The two states conducted common foreign, defense, and financial policies, but all other governmental faculties were divided among respective states.\nAustria-Hungary was a multinational state and one of Europe's major powers at the time. Austria-Hungary was geographically the second-largest country in Europe after the Russian Empire, at and the third-most populous (after Russia and the German Empire). The Empire built up the fourth-largest machine building industry in the world, after the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Austria-Hungary also became the world's third-largest manufacturer and exporter of electric home appliances, electric industrial appliances, and power generation apparatus for power plants, after the United States and the German Empire.\nThe Austro-Hungarian Compromise remained bitterly unpopular among the ethnic Hungarian voters because ethnic Hungarians did not vote for the ruling pro-compromise parties in the Hungarian parliamentary elections. Therefore, the political maintenance of the Austro-Hungarian Compromise (thus Austria-Hungary itself) was mostly a result of the popularity of the pro-compromise ruling Liberal Party among the ethnic minority voters in the Kingdom of Hungary.\nAfter 1878, Bosnia and Herzegovina came under Austro-Hungarian military and civilian rule until it was fully annexed in 1908, provoking the Bosnian crisis among the other powers. The northern part of the Ottoman Sanjak of Novi Pazar was also under \"de facto\" joint occupation during that period, but the Austro-Hungarian army withdrew as part of their annexation of Bosnia. The annexation of Bosnia also led to Islam being recognized as an official state religion due to Bosnia's Muslim population.\nAustria-Hungary was one of the Central Powers in World War I, which began with an Austro-Hungarian war declaration on the Kingdom of Serbia on 28 July 1914. It was already effectively dissolved by the time the military authorities signed the armistice of Villa Giusti on 3 November 1918. The Kingdom of Hungary and the First Austrian Republic were treated as its successors \"de jure\", whereas the independence of the West Slavs and South Slavs of the Empire as the First Czechoslovak Republic, the Second Polish Republic, and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, respectively, and most of the territorial demands of the Kingdom of Romania were also recognized by the victorious powers in 1920.\nCreation.\nThe Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 (called the \"Ausgleich\" in German and the \"Kiegyez\u00e9s\" in Hungarian), which inaugurated the empire's dual structure in place of the former Austrian Empire (1804\u20131867), originated at a time when Austria had declined in strength and in power\u2014both in the Italian Peninsula (as a result of the Second Italian War of Independence of 1859) and among the states of the German Confederation (it had been surpassed by Prussia as the dominant German-speaking power following the Austro-Prussian War of 1866). The Compromise re-established the full sovereignty of the Kingdom of Hungary, which was lost after the Hungarian Revolution of 1848.\nOther factors in the constitutional changes were continued Hungarian dissatisfaction with rule from Vienna and increasing national consciousness on the part of other nationalities (or ethnicities) of the Austrian Empire. Hungarian dissatisfaction arose partly from Austria's suppression with Russian support of the Hungarian liberal revolution of 1848\u201349. However, dissatisfaction with Austrian rule had grown for many years within Hungary and had many other causes.\nBy the late 1850s, a large number of Hungarians who had supported the 1848\u201349 revolution were willing to accept the Habsburg monarchy. They argued that while Hungary had the right to full internal independence, under the Pragmatic Sanction of 1713, foreign affairs and defense were \"common\" to both Austria and Hungary.\nAfter the Austrian defeat at K\u00f6niggr\u00e4tz, the government realized it needed to reconcile with Hungary to regain the status of a great power. The new foreign minister, Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust, wanted to conclude the stalemated negotiations with the Hungarians. To secure the monarchy, Emperor Franz Joseph began negotiations for a compromise with the Hungarian nobility, led by Ferenc De\u00e1k. On 20 March 1867, the re-established Hungarian parliament at Pest started to negotiate the new laws to be accepted on 30 March. However, Hungarian leaders received the Emperor's coronation as King of Hungary on 8 June as a necessity for the laws to be enacted within the lands of the Holy Crown of Hungary. On 28 July, Franz Joseph, in his new capacity as King of Hungary, approved and promulgated the new laws, which officially gave birth to the Dual Monarchy.\nName and terminology.\nThe realm's official name was in ' and in ' (), though in international relations \"Austria\u2013Hungary\" was used (; ). The Austrians also used the names () (in detail ; ) and \"Danubian Monarchy\" (; ) or \"Dual Monarchy\" (; ) and \"The Double Eagle\" (; ), but none of these became widespread either in Hungary, or elsewhere.\nThe realm's full name used in the internal administration was The Kingdoms and Lands Represented in the Imperial Council and the Lands of the Holy Hungarian Crown of St. Stephen.\nFrom 1867 onwards, the abbreviations heading the names of official institutions in Austria\u2013Hungary reflected their responsibility: \nFollowing a decision of Franz Joseph I in 1868, the realm bore the official name Austro-Hungarian Monarchy/Realm (; ) in its international relations. It was often contracted to the Dual Monarchy in English or simply referred to as Austria.\nStructure.\nThe Compromise turned the Habsburg domains into a real union between the Austrian Empire (\"Lands Represented in the Imperial Council\", or Cisleithania) in the western and northern half and the Kingdom of Hungary (\"Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen\", or Transleithania). in the eastern half. The two halves shared a common monarch, who ruled as Emperor of Austria over the western and northern half portion and as King of Hungary over the eastern portion. Foreign relations and defense were managed jointly, and the two countries also formed a customs union. All other state functions were to be handled separately by each of the two states.\nCertain regions, such as Polish Galicia within Cisleithania and Croatia within Transleithania, enjoyed autonomous status, each with its own unique governmental structures (see: Polish Autonomy in Galicia and Croatian\u2013Hungarian Settlement).\nThe division between Austria and Hungary was so marked that there was no common citizenship: one was either an Austrian citizen or a Hungarian citizen, never both. This also meant that there were always separate Austrian and Hungarian passports, never a common one. However, neither Austrian nor Hungarian passports were used in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia. Instead, the Kingdom issued its own passports, which were written in Croatian and French, and displayed the coat of arms of the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia-Dalmatia on them. Croatia-Slavonia also had executive autonomy regarding naturalization and citizenship, defined as \"Hungarian-Croatian citizenship\" for the kingdom's citizens. It is not known what kind of passports were used in Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was under the control of both Austria and Hungary.\nThe Kingdom of Hungary had always maintained a separate parliament, the Diet of Hungary, even after the Austrian Empire was created in 1804. The administration and government of the Kingdom of Hungary (until 1848\u201349 Hungarian revolution) remained largely untouched by the government structure of the overarching Austrian Empire. Hungary's central government structures remained well separated from the Austrian imperial government. The country was governed by the Council of Lieutenancy of Hungary (the Gubernium) \u2013 located in Pressburg and later in Pest \u2013 and by the Hungarian Royal Court Chancellery in Vienna. The Hungarian government and Hungarian parliament were suspended after the Hungarian revolution of 1848 and were reinstated after the Austro-Hungarian Compromise in 1867.\nDespite Austria and Hungary sharing a common currency, they were fiscally sovereign and independent entities. Since the beginnings of the personal union (from 1527), the government of the Kingdom of Hungary could preserve its separate and independent budget. After the revolution of 1848\u20131849, the Hungarian budget was amalgamated with the Austrian, and it was only after the Compromise of 1867 that Hungary obtained a separate budget. From 1527 (the creation of the monarchic personal union) to 1851, the Kingdom of Hungary maintained its own customs controls, which separated her from the other parts of the Habsburg-ruled territories. After 1867, the Austrian and Hungarian customs union agreement had to be renegotiated and stipulated every ten years. The agreements were renewed and signed by Vienna and Budapest at the end of every decade because both countries hoped to derive mutual economic benefit from the customs union. The Austrian Empire and the Kingdom of Hungary contracted their foreign commercial treaties independently of each other.\nVienna served as the Monarchy's primary capital. The Cisleithanian (Austrian) part contained about 57 percent of the total population and the larger share of its economic resources, compared to the Hungarian part.\nGovernment.\nThere were three parts to the rule of the Austro-Hungarian Empire:\nJoint government.\nThe common government was led by a Ministerial Council (\"Ministerrat f\u00fcr Gemeinsame Angelegenheiten\"), which had responsibility for the Common Army, navy, foreign policy, and the customs union. It consisted of three Imperial and Royal Joint-ministries (\"\"):\nIn addition to the three ministers, the Ministerial Council also contained the prime minister of Hungary, the prime minister of Cisleithania, some Archdukes, and the monarch. The Chief of the General Staff usually attended as well. The council was usually chaired by the Minister of the Household and Foreign Affairs, except when the Monarch was present. In addition to the council, the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments each elected a delegation of 60 members, who met separately and voted on the expenditures of the Ministerial Council, giving the two governments influence in the common administration. However, the ministers ultimately answered only to the monarch, who had the final decision on matters of foreign and military policy.\nOverlapping responsibilities between the joint ministries and the ministries of the two halves caused friction and inefficiencies. The armed forces suffered particularly from the overlap. Although the unified government determined the overall military direction, the Austrian and Hungarian governments each remained in charge of recruiting, supplies and training. Each government could have a strong influence over common governmental responsibilities. Each half of the Dual Monarchy proved quite prepared to disrupt common operations to advance its own interests.\nRelations during the half-century after 1867 between the two parts of the dual monarchy featured repeated disputes over shared external tariff arrangements and over the financial contribution of each government to the common treasury. These matters were determined by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, in which common expenditures were allocated 70% to Austria and 30% to Hungary. This division had to be renegotiated every ten years. There was political turmoil during the build-up to each renewal of the agreement. By 1907, the Hungarian share had risen to 36.4%. The disputes culminated in the early 1900s in a prolonged constitutional crisis. It was triggered by disagreement over which language to use for command in Hungarian army units and deepened by the advent to power in Budapest in April 1906 of a Hungarian nationalist coalition. Provisional renewals of the common arrangements occurred in October 1907 and in November 1917 on the basis of the \"status quo\". The negotiations in 1917 ended with the dissolution of the Dual Monarchy.\nParliaments.\nHungary and Austria maintained separate parliaments, each with its own prime minister: the Diet of Hungary (commonly known as the National Assembly) and the Imperial Council () in Cisleithania. Each parliament had its own executive government, appointed by the monarch. In this sense, Austria\u2013Hungary remained under an autocratic government, as the Emperor-King appointed both Austrian and Hungarian prime ministers along with their respective cabinets. This made both governments responsible to the Emperor-King, as neither half could have a government with a program contrary to the views of the Monarch. The Emperor-King could appoint non-parliamentary governments, for example, or keep a government that did not have a parliamentary majority in power in order to block the formation of another government which he did not approve of.\nThe Imperial Council was a bicameral body: the upper house was the House of Lords (), and the lower house was the House of Deputies (). Members of the House of Deputies were elected through a system of \"curiae\" which weighted representation in favor of the wealthy but was progressively reformed until universal manhood suffrage was introduced in 1906. To become law, bills had to be passed by both houses, signed by the government minister responsible and then granted royal assent by the Emperor.\nThe Diet of Hungary was also bicameral: the upper house was the House of Magnates (), and the lower house was the House of Representatives (). The \"curia\" system was also used to elect members of the House of Representatives. Franchise was very limited, with around 5% of men eligible to vote in 1874, rising to 8% at the beginning of World War I. The Hungarian parliament had the power to legislate on all matters concerning Hungary, but for Croatia-Slavonia only on matters which it shared with Hungary. Matters concerning Croatia-Slavonia alone fell to the Croatian-Slavonian Diet (commonly referred to as the Croatian Parliament). The Monarch had the right to veto any kind of Bill before it was presented to the National Assembly, the right to veto all legislation passed by the National Assembly, and the power to prorogue or dissolve the Assembly and call for new elections. In practice, these powers were rarely used.\nPublic administration and local governments.\nEmpire of Austria (Cisleithania).\nThe administrative system in the Austrian Empire consisted of three levels: the central State administration, the territories (\"L\u00e4nder\"), and the local communal administration. The State administration comprised all affairs having relation to rights, duties, and interests \"which are common to all territories\"; all other administrative tasks were left to the territories. Finally, the communes had self-government within their own sphere.\nThe central authorities were known as the \"Ministry\" (\"Ministerium\"). In 1867 the Ministerium consisted of seven ministries (Agriculture, Religion and Education, Finance, Interior, Justice, Commerce and Public Works, Defence). A Ministry of Railways was created in 1896, and the Ministry of Public Works was separated from Commerce in 1908. Ministries of and Social Welfare were established in 1917 to deal with issues arising from World War I. The ministries all had the title k.k. (\"Imperial-Royal\"), referring to the Imperial Crown of Austria and the Royal Crown of Bohemia.\nEach of the seventeen territories had its own government, led by a (officially \"Landeschef\", but commonly called \"Statthalter\" or \"Landespr\u00e4sident\"), appointed by the Emperor, to serve as his representative. Usually, a territory was equivalent to a Crown territory (\"Kronland\"), but the immense variations in area of the Crown territories meant that there were some exceptions. Each territory had its own territorial assembly (\"Landtag\") and executive (\"\"). The territorial assembly and executive were led by the \"Landeshauptmann\" (i.e., territorial premier), appointed by the Emperor from the members of the territorial assembly. Many branches of the territorial administrations had great similarities with those of the State, so that their spheres of activity frequently overlapped and came into collision. This administrative \"double track\", as it was called, resulted largely from the origin of the State \u2013 for the most part through a voluntary union of countries that had a strong sense of their own individuality.\nBelow the territory was the district (\"Bezirk\") under a district-head (\"Bezirkshauptmann\"), appointed by the State government. These district-heads united nearly all the administrative functions which were divided among the various ministries. Each district was divided into a number of municipalities (\"Ortsgemeinden\"), each with its own elected mayor (\"B\u00fcrgermeister\"). The nine statutory cities were autonomous units at the district-level.\nThe complexity of this system, particularly the overlap between State and territorial administration, led to moves for administrative reform. As early as 1904, premier Ernest von Koerber had declared that a complete change in the principles of administration would be essential if the machinery of State were to continue working. Richard von Bienerth's last act as Austrian premier in May 1911 was the appointment of a commission nominated by the Emperor to draw up a scheme of administrative reform. The imperial rescript did not present reforms as a matter of urgency or outline an overall philosophy for them. The continuous progress of society, it said, had made increased demands on the administration, that is to say, it was assumed that reform was required because of the changing times, not underlying problems with the administrative structure. The reform commission first occupied itself with reforms about which there was no controversy. In 1912 it published \"Proposals for the training of State officials\". The commission produced several further reports before its work was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I in 1914. It was not till March 1918 that the Seidler Government decided upon a program of national autonomy as a basis for administrative reform, which was, however, never carried into effect.\nKingdom of Hungary (Transleithania).\nExecutive power in Transleithania was vested in a cabinet responsible to the National Assembly, consisting of ten ministers, including: the Prime Minister, the Minister for Croatia-Slavonia, a Minister besides the King, and the Ministers of the Interior, National Defence, Religion and Public Education, Finance, Agriculture, Industry, and Trade, Public Works and Transport, and Justice. The Minister besides the King was responsible for coordination with Austria and the Imperial and royal court in Vienna. In 1889, the Ministry of Agriculture, Industry, and Trade was split into separate ministries of Agriculture and Trade. The Ministry of Public Works and Transport was folded into the new Ministry of Trade.\nFrom 1867 the administrative and political divisions of the lands belonging to the Hungarian crown were remodeled due to some restorations and other changes. In 1868 Transylvania was definitely reunited to Hungary proper, and the town and district of Fiume maintained its status as a \"Corpus separatum\" (\"separate body\"). The \"Military Frontier\" was abolished in stages between 1871 and 1881, with Banat and \u0160ajka\u0161ka being incorporated into Hungary proper and the Croatian and Slavonian Military Frontiers joining Croatia-Slavonia.\nIn regard to local government, Hungary had traditionally been divided into around seventy counties (, singular \"megye\"; Croatian: ) and an array of districts and cities with special statuses. This system was reformed in two stages. In 1870, most historical privileges of territorial subdivisions were abolished, but the existing names and territories were retained. At this point, there were a total of 175 territorial subdivisions: 65 counties (49 in Hungary proper, 8 in Transylvania, and 8 in Croatia), 89 cities with municipal rights, and 21 other types of municipality (3 in Hungary proper and 18 in Transylvania). In a further reform in 1876, most of the cities and other types of municipality were incorporated into the counties. The counties in Hungary were grouped into seven circuits, which had no administrative function. The lowest level subdivision was the district or \"processus\" ().\nAfter 1876, some urban municipalities remained independent of the counties in which they were situated. There were 26 of these urban municipalities in Hungary: Arad, Baja, Debreczen, Gy\u0151r, H\u00f3dmez\u0151v\u00e1s\u00e1rhely, Kassa, Kecskem\u00e9t, Kolozsv\u00e1r, Kom\u00e1rom, Marosv\u00e1s\u00e1rhely, Nagyv\u00e1rad, Pancsova, P\u00e9cs, Pozsony, Selmecz- \u00e9s B\u00e9labanya, Sopron, Szabadka, Szatm\u00e1rn\u00e9meti, Szeged, Sz\u00e9kesfeherv\u00e1r, Temesv\u00e1r, \u00dajvid\u00e9k, Versecz, Zombor, and Budapest, the capital of the country. In Croatia-Slavonia, there were four: Osijek, Vara\u017edin and Zagreb and Zemun. Fiume continued to form a separate division.\nThe administration of the municipalities was carried on by an official appointed by the king. These municipalities each had a council of twenty members.\nCounties were led by a County head ( or ) appointed by the king and under the control of the Ministry of the Interior. Each county had a municipal committee of 20 members, comprising 50% virilists (persons paying the highest direct taxes) and 50% elected persons fulfilling the prescribed census and \"ex officio\" members (deputy county head, main notary, and others). The powers and responsibilities of the counties were constantly decreased and were transferred to regional agencies of the kingdom's ministries.\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\nIn 1878, the Congress of Berlin placed the Bosnia Vilayet of the Ottoman Empire under Austro-Hungarian occupation. The region was formally annexed in 1908 and was governed by Austria and Hungary jointly through the Imperial and Royal Ministry of Finance's Bosnian Office (). The Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina was headed by a governor (), who was also the commander of the military forces based in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The executive branch was headed by a National Council, which was chaired by the governor and contained the governor's deputy and chiefs of departments. At first, the government had only three departments, administrative, financial and legislative. Later, other departments, including construction, economics, education, religion, and technical, were founded as well.\nThe Diet of Bosnia, created in 1910, had very limited legislative powers. The main legislative power was in the hands of the emperor, the parliaments in Vienna and Budapest, and the joint-minister of finance. The Diet of Bosnia could make proposals, but they had to be approved by both parliaments in Vienna and Budapest. The Diet could only deliberate on matters that affected Bosnia and Herzegovina exclusively; decisions on armed forces, commercial and traffic connections, customs, and similar matters, were made by the parliaments in Vienna and Budapest. The Diet also had no control over the National Council or the municipal councils.\nThe Austrian-Hungarian authorities left the Ottoman division of Bosnia and Herzegovina untouched, and only changed the names of divisional units. Thus the Bosnia Vilayet was renamed \"Reichsland\", \"sanjaks\" were renamed \"Kreise\" (Circuits), \"kazas\" were renamed \"Bezirke\" (Districts), and nahiyahs became \"Exposituren\". There were six \"Kreise\" and 54 \"Bezirke\". The heads of the \"Kreises\" were \"Kreiseleiters,\" and the heads of the \"Bezirke\" were \"Bezirkesleiters\".\nJudicial system.\nEmpire of Austria.\nThe December Constitution of 1867 restored the rule of law, independence of the judiciary, and public jury trials in Austria. The system of general courts had the same four rungs it still has today:\nHabsburg subjects would from now on be able to take the State to court should it violate their fundamental rights. Since regular courts were still unable to overrule the bureaucracy, much less the legislature, these guarantees necessitated the creation of specialist courts that could:\nKingdom of Hungary.\nJudicial power was also independent of the executive in Hungary. After the Croatian\u2013Hungarian Settlement of 1868, Croatia-Slavonia had its own independent judicial system (the Table of Seven was the court of last instance for Croatia-Slavonia with final civil and criminal jurisdiction). The judicial authorities in Hungary were:\nPolitics.\nThe first prime minister of Hungary after the Compromise was Count Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy (1867\u20131871). The old Hungarian Constitution was restored, and Franz Joseph was crowned as King of Hungary. Andr\u00e1ssy next served as the Foreign Minister of Austria\u2013Hungary (1871\u20131879).\nThe Empire relied increasingly on a cosmopolitan bureaucracy\u2014in which Czechs played an important role\u2014backed by loyal elements, including a large part of the German, Hungarian, Polish and Croat aristocracy.\nPolitical struggles in the Empire.\nThe traditional aristocracy and land-based gentry class gradually faced increasingly wealthy men of the cities, who achieved wealth through trade and industrialization. The urban middle and upper class tended to seek their own power and supported progressive movements in the aftermath of revolutions in Europe.\nAs in the German Empire, the Austro-Hungarian Empire frequently used liberal economic policies and practices. From the 1860s, businessmen succeeded in industrializing parts of the Empire. Newly prosperous members of the bourgeoisie erected large homes and began to take prominent roles in urban life that rivaled the aristocracy's. In the early period, they encouraged the government to seek foreign investment to build up infrastructure, such as railroads, in aid of industrialization, transportation and communications, and development.\nThe influence of liberals in Austria, most of them ethnic Germans, weakened under the leadership of Count Eduard von Taaffe, the Austrian prime minister from 1879 to 1893. Taaffe used a coalition of clergy, conservatives and Slavic parties to weaken the liberals. In Bohemia, for example, he authorized Czech as an official language of the bureaucracy and school system, thus breaking the German speakers' monopoly on holding office. Such reforms encouraged other ethnic groups to push for greater autonomy as well. By playing nationalities off one another, the government ensured the monarchy's central role in holding together competing interest groups in an era of rapid change.\nDuring the First World War, rising national sentiments and labour movements contributed to strikes, protests and civil unrest in the Empire. After the war, republican, national parties contributed to the disintegration and collapse of the monarchy in Austria and Hungary. Republics were established in Vienna and Budapest.\nLegislation to help the working class emerged from Catholic conservatives. They turned to social reform by using Swiss and German models and intervening in private industry. In Germany, Chancellor Otto von Bismarck had used such policies to neutralize socialist promises. The Catholics studied the Swiss Factory Act of 1877, which limited working hours for everyone and provided maternity benefits, and German laws that insured workers against industrial risks inherent in the workplace. These served as the basis for Austria's 1885 Trade Code Amendment.\nThe Austro-Hungarian compromise and its supporters remained bitterly unpopular among the ethnic Hungarian voters, and the continuous electoral success of the pro-compromise Liberal Party frustrated many Hungarian voters. While the pro-compromise liberal parties were the most popular among ethnic minority voters, the Slovak, Serb, and Romanian minority parties remained unpopular among the ethnic minorities. The nationalist Hungarian parties, which were supported by the overwhelming majority of ethnic Hungarian voters, remained in the opposition, except from 1906 to 1910 where the nationalist Hungarian parties were able to form government.\nEthnic relations.\nIn July 1849, the Hungarian Revolutionary Parliament proclaimed and enacted ethnic and minority rights (the next such laws were in Switzerland), but these were overturned after the Russian and Austrian armies crushed the Hungarian Revolution. After the Kingdom of Hungary reached the Compromise with the Habsburg Dynasty in 1867, one of the first acts of its restored Parliament was to pass a Law on Nationalities (Act Number XLIV of 1868). It was a liberal piece of legislation and offered extensive language and cultural rights. It did not recognize non-Hungarians to have rights to form states with any territorial autonomy.\nThe \"Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867\" created the personal union of the independent states of Hungary and Austria, linked under a common monarch also having joint institutions. The Hungarian majority asserted more of their identity within the Kingdom of Hungary, and it came to conflict with some of her own minorities. The imperial power of German-speakers who controlled the Austrian half was resented by others. In addition, the emergence of nationalism in the newly independent Romania and Serbia also contributed to ethnic issues in the empire.\nArticle 19 of the 1867 \"Basic State Act\" (\"Staatsgrundgesetz\"), valid only for the Cisleithanian (Austrian) part of Austria\u2013Hungary, said:\nThe implementation of this principle led to several disputes, as it was not clear which languages could be regarded as \"customary\". The Germans, the traditional bureaucratic, capitalist and cultural elite, demanded the recognition of their language as a customary language in every part of the empire. German nationalists, especially in the Sudetenland (part of Bohemia), looked to Berlin in the new German Empire. There was a German-speaking element in Austria proper (west of Vienna), but it did not display much sense of German nationalism. That is, it did not demand an independent state; rather it flourished by holding most of the high military and diplomatic offices in the Empire.\nItalian was regarded as an old \"culture language\" (\"\") by German intellectuals and had always been granted equal rights as an official language of the Empire, but the Germans had difficulty in accepting the Slavic languages as equal to their own. On one occasion Count A. Auersperg (Anastasius Gr\u00fcn) entered the Diet of Carniola carrying what he claimed to be the whole corpus of Slovene literature under his arm; this was to demonstrate that the Slovene language could not be substituted for German as the language of higher education.\nThe following years saw official recognition of several languages, at least in Austria. From 1867, laws awarded Croatian equal status with Italian in Dalmatia. From 1882, there was a Slovene majority in the Diet of Carniola and in the capital Laibach (Ljubljana); they replaced German with Slovene as their primary official language. Galicia designated Polish instead of German in 1869 as the customary language of government.\nIn Istria, the Istro-Romanians, a small ethnic group composed by around 2,600 people in the 1880s, suffered severe discrimination. The Croats of the region, who formed the majority, tried to assimilate them, while the Italian minority supported them in their requests for self-determination. In 1888, the possibility of opening the first school for the Istro-Romanians teaching in the Romanian language was discussed in the Diet of Istria. The proposal was very popular among them. The Italian deputies showed their support, but the Croat ones opposed it and tried to show that the Istro-Romanians were in fact Slavs. During Austro-Hungarian rule, the Istro-Romanians lived under poverty conditions, and those living in the island of Krk were fully assimilated by 1875.\nThe language disputes were most fiercely fought in Bohemia, where the Czech speakers formed a majority and sought equal status for their language to German. The Czechs had lived primarily in Bohemia since the 6th century and German immigrants had begun settling the Bohemian periphery in the 13th century. The constitution of 1627 made the German language a second official language and equal to Czech. German speakers lost their majority in the Bohemian Diet in 1880 and became a minority to Czech speakers in the cities of Prague and Pilsen (while retaining a slight numerical majority in the city of Brno (Br\u00fcnn)). The old Charles University in Prague, hitherto dominated by German speakers, was divided into German and Czech-speaking faculties in 1882.\nAt the same time, Hungarian dominance faced challenges from the local majorities of Romanians in Transylvania and in the eastern Banat, Slovaks in today's Slovakia, and Croats and Serbs in the crown lands of Croatia and of Dalmatia (today's Croatia), in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and in the provinces known as the Vojvodina (today's northern Serbia). The Romanians and the Serbs began to agitate for union with their fellow nationalists and language speakers in the newly founded states of Romania (1859\u20131878) and Serbia.\nHungary's leaders were generally less willing than their Austrian counterparts to share power with their subject minorities, but they granted a large measure of autonomy to Croatia in 1868. To some extent, they modeled their relationship to that kingdom on their own compromise with Austria of the previous year. In spite of nominal autonomy, the Croatian government was an economic and administrative part of Hungary, which the Croatians resented. In the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina many advocated the idea of a trialist Austro-Hungaro-Croatian monarchy; among the supporters of the idea were Archduke Leopold Salvator, Archduke Franz Ferdinand and emperor and king Charles I who during his short reign supported the trialist idea only to be vetoed by the Hungarian government and Count Istvan Tisza. The count finally signed the trialist proclamation after heavy pressure from the king on 23 October 1918.\nLanguage was one of the most contentious issues in Austro-Hungarian politics. All governments faced difficult and divisive hurdles in deciding on the languages of government and of instruction. The minorities sought the widest opportunities for education in their own languages, as well as in the \"dominant\" languages\u2014Hungarian and German. By the \"Ordinance of 5 April 1897\", the Austrian Prime Minister Count Kasimir Felix Badeni gave Czech equal standing with German in the internal government of Bohemia; this led to a crisis because of nationalist German agitation throughout the empire. The Crown dismissed Badeni.\nThe Hungarian Minority Act of 1868 gave the minorities (Slovaks, Romanians, Serbs, et al.) individual (but not also communal) rights to use their language in offices, schools (although in practice often only in those founded by them and not by the state), courts and municipalities (if 20% of the deputies demanded it). Beginning with the 1879 Primary Education Act and the 1883 Secondary Education Act, the Hungarian state made more efforts to reduce the use of non-Magyar languages, in strong violation of the 1868 Nationalities Law. After 1875, all Slovak language schools higher than elementary were closed, including the only three high schools (gymnasiums) in Rev\u00faca (Nagyr\u0151ce), Tur\u010diansky Sv\u00e4t\u00fd Martin (Tur\u00f3cszentm\u00e1rton) and Kl\u00e1\u0161tor pod Znievom (Zni\u00f3v\u00e1ralja). From June 1907, all public and private schools in Hungary were obliged to ensure that after the fourth grade, the pupils could express themselves fluently in Hungarian. This led to the further closing of minority schools, devoted mostly to the Slovak and Rusyn languages.\nThe two kingdoms sometimes divided their spheres of influence. According to Misha Glenny in his book, \"The Balkans, 1804\u20131999\", the Austrians responded to Hungarian support of Czechs by supporting the Croatian national movement in Zagreb.\nIn recognition that he reigned in a multi-ethnic country, Emperor Franz Joseph spoke (and used) German, Hungarian and Czech fluently, and Croatian, Serbian, Polish and Italian to some degree.\nJews.\nAround 1900, Jews numbered about two million in the whole territory of the Austro-Hungarian Empire; their position was ambiguous. The populist and antisemitic politics of the Christian Social Party are sometimes viewed as a model for Adolf Hitler's Nazism. Antisemitic parties and movements existed, but the governments of Vienna and Budapest did not initiate pogroms or implement official antisemitic policies. They feared that such ethnic violence could ignite other ethnic minorities and escalate out of control. The antisemitic parties remained on the periphery of the political sphere due to their low popularity among voters in the parliamentary elections.\nIn that period, the majority of Jews in Austria\u2013Hungary lived in small towns (\"shtetls\") in Galicia and rural areas in Hungary and Bohemia; however, they had large communities and even local majorities in the downtown districts of Vienna, Budapest and Prague. Of the pre-World War I military forces of the major European powers, the Austro-Hungarian army was almost alone in its regular promotion of Jews to positions of command. While the Jewish population of the lands of the Dual Monarchy was about five percent, Jews made up nearly eighteen percent of the reserve officer corps. Thanks to the modernity of the constitution and to the benevolence of emperor Franz Joseph, the Austrian Jews came to regard the era of Austria\u2013Hungary as a golden era of their history. By 1910 about 900,000 religious Jews made up approximately 5% of the population of Hungary and about 23% of Budapest's citizenry. Jews accounted for 54% of commercial business owners, 85% of financial institution directors and owners in banking, and 62% of all employees in commerce, 20% of all general grammar school students, and 37% of all commercial scientific grammar school students, 31.9% of all engineering students, and 34.1% of all students in human faculties of the universities. Jews were accounted for 48.5% of all physicians, and 49.4% of all lawyers/jurists in Hungary. Note: The numbers of Jews were reconstructed from religious censuses. They did not include the people of Jewish origin who had converted to Christianity, or the number of atheists. Among many Hungarian parliament members of Jewish origin, the most famous Jewish members in Hungarian political life were Vilmos V\u00e1zsonyi as Minister of Justice, Samu Hazai as Minister of War, J\u00e1nos Teleszky as minister of finance and J\u00e1nos Hark\u00e1nyi as minister of trade, and J\u00f3zsef Szter\u00e9nyi as minister of trade.\nForeign policy.\nThe minister of foreign affairs conducted the foreign relations of the Dual Monarchy, and negotiated treaties.\nThe Dual Monarchy was created in the wake of a losing war in 1866 with Prussia and Italy. To rebuild Habsburg prestige and gain revenge against Prussia, Count Friedrich Ferdinand von Beust became foreign secretary. He hated Prussia's diplomat, Otto von Bismarck, who had repeatedly outmaneuvered him. Beust looked to France and negotiated with Emperor Napoleon III and Italy for an anti-Prussian alliance. No terms could be reached. The decisive victory of Prusso-German armies in the war of 1870 with France and the founding of the German Empire ended all hope of revenge and Beust retired.\nAfter being forced out of Germany and Italy, the Dual Monarchy turned to the Balkans, which were in tumult as nationalistic efforts were trying to end the rule of the Ottomans. Both Russia and Austria\u2013Hungary saw an opportunity to expand in this region. Russia in particular took on the role of protector of Slavs and Orthodox Christians. Austria envisioned a multi-ethnic, religiously diverse empire under Vienna's control. Count Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy, a Hungarian who was Foreign Minister (1871 to 1879), made the centerpiece of his policy one of opposition to Russian expansion in the Balkans and blocking Serbian ambitions to dominate a new South Slav federation. He wanted Germany to ally with Austria, not Russia.\nWhen Russia defeated Turkey in a war the resulting Treaty of San Stefano was seen in Austria as much too favourable for Russia and its Orthodox-Slavic goals. The Congress of Berlin in 1878 let Austria occupy (but not annex) the province of Bosnia and Herzegovina, a predominantly Slavic area. In 1914, Slavic militants in Bosnia rejected Austria's plan to fully absorb the area; they assassinated the Austrian heir and precipitated World War I.\nVoting rights.\nTowards the end of the 19th century, the Austrian half of the dual monarchy began to move towards constitutionalism. A constitutional system with a parliament, the Reichsrat was created, and a bill of rights was enacted also in 1867. Suffrage to the Reichstag's lower house was gradually expanded until 1907, when equal suffrage for all male citizens was introduced.\nThe 1907 Cisleithanian legislative election were the first elections held under universal male suffrage, after an electoral reform abolishing tax-paying requirements for voters had been adopted by the council and was endorsed by Emperor Franz Joseph earlier in the year. However, seat allocations were based on tax revenues from the States.\nDemographics.\nThe following data is based on the official Austro-Hungarian census conducted in 1910.\nLanguages.\nIn Austria (Cisleithania), the census of 1910 recorded \"Umgangssprache\", everyday language. Jews and those using German in offices often stated German as their \"Umgangssprache\", even when having a different \"Muttersprache\". 36.8% of the total population spoke German as their native language, and more than 71% of the inhabitants spoke some German.\nIn Hungary (Transleithania), the census was based primarily on mother tongue, 48.1% of the total population spoke Hungarian as their native language. Not counting autonomous Croatia-Slavonia, more than 54.4% of the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Hungary were native speakers of Hungarian (this included also the Jews around 5% of the population as mostly they were Hungarian-speaking).\nNote that some languages were considered dialects of more widely spoken languages. For example: in the census, Rhaeto-Romance languages were counted as \"Italian\", while Istro-Romanian was counted as \"Romanian\". Yiddish was counted as \"German\" in both Austria and Hungary.\n \nHistorical regions:\nReligion.\nSolely in the Empire of Austria:\nSolely in the Kingdom of Hungary:\nLargest cities.\nData: census in 1910\nEducation.\nAustrian Empire.\nPrimary and secondary schools\nThe organization of the Austrian elementary schools was based on the principle of compulsory school attendance, free education, and the imparting of public instruction in the child's own language. Side by side with these existed private schools. The proportion of children attending private schools to those attending the public elementary schools in 1912 was 144,000 to 4.5 millions, i.e. a thirtieth part. Hence the accusation of denationalizing children through the Schulvereine must be accepted with caution. The expenses of education were distributed as follows: the communes built the schoolhouses, the political sub-districts (Bezirke) paid the teachers, the Crown territory gave a grant, and the State appointed the inspectors. Since the State supervised the schools without maintaining them, it was able to increase its demands without being hampered by financial considerations. It is remarkable that the difference between the State educational estimates in Austria and in Hungary was one of 9.3 millions in the former as opposed to 67.6 in the latter. Under Austria, since everywhere that 40 scholars of one nationality were to be found within a radius of 5\u00a0km. a school had to be set up in which their language was used, national schools were assured even to linguistic minorities. It is true that this mostly happened at the expense of the German industrial communities, since the Slav labourers as immigrants acquired schools in their own language. The number of elementary schools increased from 19,016 in 1900 to 24,713 in 1913; the number of scholars from 3,490,000 in 1900 to 4,630,000 in 1913.\nUniversities in Austrian Empire\nThe first University in the Austrian half of the Empire (Charles University) was founded by H.R. Emperor Charles IV in Prague in 1347. The second oldest university (University of Vienna) was founded by Duke Rudolph IV in 1365.\nThe higher educational institutions were predominantly German, but beginning in the 1870s, language shifts began to occur. These establishments, which in the middle of the 19th century had had a predominantly German character, underwent in Galicia a conversion into Polish national institutions, in Bohemia and Moravia a separation into German and Czech ones. Thus Germans, Czechs and Poles were provided for. But now the smaller nations also made their voices heard: the Ruthenians, Slovenes and Italians. The Ruthenians demanded at first, in view of the predominantly Ruthenian character of East Galicia, a national partition of the Polish university existing there. Since the Poles were at first unyielding, Ruthenian demonstrations and strikes of students arose, and the Ruthenians were no longer content with the reversion of a few separate professorial chairs, and with parallel courses of lectures. By a pact concluded on 28 January 1914 the Poles promised a Ruthenian university; but owing to the war the question lapsed. The Italians could hardly claim a university of their own on grounds of population (in 1910 they numbered 783,000), but they claimed it all the more on grounds of their ancient culture. All parties were agreed that an Italian faculty of laws should be created; the difficulty lay in the choice of the place. The Italians demanded Trieste; but the Government was afraid to let this Adriatic port become the centre of an irredenta; moreover the Southern Slavs of the city wished it kept free from an Italian educational establishment. Bienerth in 1910 brought about a compromise; namely, that it should be founded at once, the situation to be provisionally in Vienna, and to be transferred within four years to Italian national territory. The German National Union (Nationalverband) agreed to extend temporary hospitality to the Italian university in Vienna, but the Southern Slav Hochschule Club demanded a guarantee that a later transfer to the coast provinces should not be contemplated, together with the simultaneous foundation of Slovene professorial chairs in Prague and Cracow, and preliminary steps towards the foundation of a Southern Slav university in Laibach. But in spite of the constant renewal of negotiations for a compromise it was impossible to arrive at any agreement, until the outbreak of war left all the projects for a Ruthenian university at Lemberg, a Slovene one in Laibach, and a second Czech one in Moravia, unrealized.\nKingdom of Hungary.\nPrimary and secondary schools\nOne of the first measures of newly established Hungarian government was to provide supplementary schools of a non-denominational character. By a law passed in 1868 attendance at school was obligatory for all children between the ages of 6 and 12 years. The communes or parishes were bound to maintain elementary schools, and they were entitled to levy an additional tax of 5% on the state taxes for their maintenance. But the number of state-aided elementary schools was continually increasing, as the spread of the Magyar language to the other races through the medium of the elementary schools was one of the principal concerns of the Hungarian government, and was vigorously pursued. In 1902 there were in Hungary 18,729 elementary schools with 32,020 teachers, attended by 2,573,377 pupils, figures which compare favourably with those of 1877, when there were 15,486 schools with 20,717 teachers, attended by 1,559,636 pupils. In about 61% of these schools the language used was exclusively Magyar, in about 6 20% it was mixed, and in the remainder some non-Magyar language was used. In 1902, 80.56% of the children of school age actually attended school. Since 1891 infant schools, for children between the ages of 3 and 6 years, were maintained either by the communes or by the state.\nThe public instruction of Hungary contained three other groups of educational institutions: middle or secondary schools, \"high schools\" and technical schools. The middle schools comprised classical schools (gymnasia) which were preparatory for the universities and other \"high schools\", and modern schools (Realschulen) preparatory for the technical schools. Their course of study was generally eight years, and they were maintained mostly by the state. The state-maintained gymnasia were mostly of recent foundation, but some schools maintained by the various churches had been in existence for three or sometimes four centuries. The number of middle schools in 1902 was 243 with 4705 teachers, attended by 71,788 pupils; in 1880 their number was 185, attended by 40,747 pupils.\nUniversities in Kingdom of Hungary\nIn the year 1276, the university of Veszpr\u00e9m was destroyed by the troops of P\u00e9ter Cs\u00e1k and it was never rebuilt. A university was established by Louis I of Hungary in P\u00e9cs in 1367. Sigismund established a university at \u00d3buda in 1395. Another, Universitas Istropolitana, was established 1465 in Pozsony (now Bratislava in Slovakia) by Mattias Corvinus. None of these medieval universities survived the Ottoman wars. Nagyszombat University was founded in 1635 and moved to Buda in 1777 and it is called E\u00f6tv\u00f6s Lor\u00e1nd University today. The world's first institute of technology was founded in Selmecb\u00e1nya, Kingdom of Hungary (since 1920 Bansk\u00e1 \u0160tiavnica, now Slovakia) in 1735. Its legal successor is the University of Miskolc in Hungary. The Budapest University of Technology and Economics (BME) is considered the oldest institute of technology in the world with university rank and structure. Its legal predecessor the Institutum Geometrico-Hydrotechnicum was founded in 1782 by Emperor Joseph II.\nThe high schools included the universities, of which Hungary possessed five, all maintained by the state: at Budapest (founded in 1635), at Kolozsv\u00e1r (founded in 1872), and at Zagreb (founded in 1874). Newer universities were established in Debrecen in 1912, and Pozsony university was reestablished after a half millennium in 1912. They had four faculties: theology, law, philosophy and medicine (the university at Zagreb was without a faculty of medicine). There were in addition ten high schools of law, called academies, which in 1900 were attended by 1569 pupils. The Polytechnicum in Budapest, founded in 1844, which contained four faculties and was attended in 1900 by 1772 pupils, was also considered a high school. There were in Hungary in 1900 forty-nine theological colleges, twenty-nine Catholic, five Greek Uniat, four Greek Orthodox, ten Protestant and one Jewish. Among special schools the principal mining schools were at Selmeczb\u00e1nya, Nagy\u00e1g and Fels\u0151b\u00e1nya; the principal agricultural colleges at Debreczen and Kolozsv\u00e1r; and there was a school of forestry at Selmeczb\u00e1nya, military colleges at Budapest, Kassa, D\u00e9va and Zagreb, and a naval school at Fiume. There were in addition a number of training institutes for teachers and a large number of schools of commerce, several art schools \u2013 for design, painting, sculpture, music.\nEconomy.\nThe heavily rural Austro-Hungarian economy slowly modernised after 1867. Railroads opened up once-remote areas, and cities grew. Many small firms promoted capitalist way of production. Technological change accelerated industrialization and urbanization. The first Austrian stock exchange (the Wiener B\u00f6rse) was opened in 1771 in Vienna, the first stock exchange of the Kingdom of Hungary (the Budapest Stock Exchange) was opened in Budapest in 1864. The central bank (Bank of issue) was founded as Austrian National Bank in 1816. In 1878, it transformed into Austro-Hungarian National Bank with principal offices in both Vienna and Budapest. The central bank was governed by alternating Austrian or Hungarian governors and vice-governors.\nThe gross national product per capita grew roughly 1.76% per year from 1870 to 1913. That level of growth compared very favorably to that of other European nations such as Britain (1%), France (1.06%), and Germany (1.51%). However, in a comparison with Germany and Britain, the Austro-Hungarian economy as a whole still lagged considerably, as sustained modernization had begun much later. Like the German Empire, that of Austria\u2013Hungary frequently employed liberal economic policies and practices. In 1873, the old Hungarian capital Buda and \u00d3buda (Ancient Buda) were officially merged with the third city, Pest, thus creating the new metropolis of Budapest. The dynamic Pest grew into Hungary's administrative, political, economic, trade and cultural hub. Many of the state institutions and the modern administrative system of Hungary were established during this period. Economic growth centered on Vienna and Budapest, the Austrian lands (areas of modern Austria), the Alpine region and the Bohemian lands. In the later years of the 19th century, rapid economic growth spread to the central Hungarian plain and to the Carpathian lands. As a result, wide disparities of development existed within the empire. In general, the western areas became more developed than the eastern ones. The Kingdom of Hungary became the world's second-largest flour exporter after the United States. The large Hungarian food exports were not limited to neighbouring Germany and Italy: Hungary became the most important foreign food supplier of the large cities and industrial centres of the United Kingdom. Galicia, which has been described as the poorest province of Austro-Hungary, experienced near-constant famines, resulting in 50,000 deaths a year. The Istro-Romanians of Istria were also poor, as pastoralism lost strength and agriculture was not productive.\nHowever, by the end of the 19th century, economic differences gradually began to even out as economic growth in the eastern parts of the monarchy consistently surpassed that in the western. The strong agriculture and food industry of the Kingdom of Hungary with the centre of Budapest became predominant within the empire and made up a large proportion of the export to the rest of Europe. Meanwhile, western areas, concentrated mainly around Prague and Vienna, excelled in various manufacturing industries. This division of labour between the east and west, besides the existing economic and monetary union, led to an even more rapid economic growth throughout Austria\u2013Hungary by the early 20th century. However, since the turn of the twentieth century, the Austrian half of the Monarchy could preserve its dominance within the empire in the sectors of the first industrial revolution, but Hungary had a better position in the industries of the second industrial revolution, in these modern sectors of the second industrial revolution the Austrian competition could not become dominant.\nThe empire's heavy industry had mostly focused on machine building, especially for the electric power industry, locomotive industry and automotive industry, while in light industry the precision mechanics industry was the most dominant. Through the years leading up to World War I the country became the 4th biggest machine manufacturer in the world.\nThe two most important trading partners were traditionally Germany (1910: 48% of all exports, 39% of all imports), and Great Britain (1910: almost 10% of all exports, 8% of all imports), the third most important partner was the United States, it followed by Russia, France, Switzerland, Romania, the Balkan states and South America. Trade with the geographically neighbouring Russia, however, had a relatively low weight (1910: 3% of all exports /mainly machinery for Russia, 7% of all imports /mainly raw materials from Russia).\nAutomotive industry.\nPrior to World War I, the Austrian Empire had five car manufacturer companies. These were: Austro-Daimler in Wiener-Neustadt (cars trucks, buses), Gr\u00e4f &amp; Stift in Vienna (cars), Laurin &amp; Klement in Mlad\u00e1 Boleslav (motorcycles, cars), Nesselsdorfer in Nesselsdorf (Kop\u0159ivnice), Moravia (automobiles), and Lohner-Werke in Vienna (cars). Austrian car production started in 1897.\nPrior to World War I, the Kingdom of Hungary had four car manufacturer companies. These were: the Ganz company in Budapest, R\u00c1BA Automobile in Gy\u0151r, M\u00c1G (later Magomobil) in Budapest, and MARTA (Hungarian Automobile Joint-stock Company Arad) in Arad. Hungarian car production started in 1900. Automotive factories in the Kingdom of Hungary manufactured motorcycles, cars, taxicabs, trucks and buses.\nElectrical industry and electronics.\nIn 1884, K\u00e1roly Zipernowsky, Ott\u00f3 Bl\u00e1thy and Miksa D\u00e9ri (ZBD), three engineers associated with the Ganz Works of Budapest, determined that open-core devices were impractical, as they were incapable of reliably regulating voltage.\nWhen employed in parallel connected electric distribution systems, closed-core transformers finally made it technically and economically feasible to provide electric power for lighting in homes, businesses and public spaces. The other essential milestone was the introduction of 'voltage source, voltage intensive' (VSVI) systems' by the invention of constant voltage generators in 1885.\nBl\u00e1thy had suggested the use of closed cores, Zipernowsky had suggested the use of parallel shunt connections, and D\u00e9ri had performed the experiments;\nThe first Hungarian water turbine was designed by the engineers of the Ganz Works in 1866, the mass production with dynamo generators started in 1883. The manufacturing of steam turbo generators started in the Ganz Works in 1903.\nIn 1905, the L\u00e1ng Machine Factory company also started the production of steam turbines for alternators.\nTungsram is a Hungarian manufacturer of light bulbs and vacuum tubes since 1896. On 13 December 1904, Hungarian S\u00e1ndor Just and Croatian Franjo Hanaman were granted a Hungarian patent (No. 34541) for the world's first tungsten filament lamp. The tungsten filament lasted longer and gave brighter light than the traditional carbon filament. Tungsten filament lamps were first marketed by the Hungarian company Tungsram in 1904. This type is often called Tungsram-bulbs in many European countries.\nDespite the long experimentation with vacuum tubes at Tungsram company, the mass production of radio tubes begun during WW1, and the production of X-ray tubes started also during the WW1 in Tungsram Company.\nThe Orion Electronics was founded in 1913. Its main profiles were the production of electrical switches, sockets, wires, incandescent lamps, electric fans, electric kettles, and various household electronics.\nThe telephone exchange was an idea of the Hungarian engineer Tivadar Pusk\u00e1s (1844\u20131893) in 1876, while he was working for Thomas Edison on a telegraph exchange.\nThe first Hungarian telephone factory (Factory for Telephone Apparatuses) was founded by J\u00e1nos Neuhold in Budapest in 1879, which produced telephones microphones, telegraphs, and telephone exchanges.\nIn 1884, the Tungsram company also started to produce microphones, telephone apparatuses, telephone switchboards and cables.\nThe Ericsson company also established a factory for telephones and switchboards in Budapest in 1911.\nAeronautic industry.\nThe first airplane in Austria was Edvard Rusjan's design, the Eda I, which had its maiden flight in the vicinity of Gorizia on 25 November 1909.\nThe first Hungarian hydrogen-filled experimental balloons were built by Istv\u00e1n Szabik and J\u00f3zsef Domin in 1784.\nThe first Hungarian designed and produced airplane (powered by a Hungarian built inline engine) was flown at R\u00e1kosmez\u0151 on 4 November 1909. The earliest Hungarian airplane with Hungarian built radial engine was flown in 1913. Between 1912 and 1918, the Hungarian aircraft industry began developing. The three greatest: UFAG Hungarian Aircraft Factory (1914), Hungarian General Aircraft Factory (1916), Hungarian Lloyd Aircraft, Engine Factory at Asz\u00f3d (1916), and Marta in Arad (1914). During the First World War, fighter planes, bombers and reconnaissance planes were produced in these factories. The most important aero-engine factories were Weiss Manfred Works, GANZ Works, and Hungarian Automobile Joint-stock Company Arad.\nLocomotive engine and railway vehicle manufacturers.\nThe locomotive (steam engines and wagons, bridge and iron structures) factories were installed in Vienna (Locomotive Factory of the State Railway Company, founded in 1839), in Wiener Neustadt (New Vienna Locomotive Factory, founded in 1841), and in Floridsdorf (Floridsdorf Locomotive Factory, founded in 1869).\nThe Hungarian Locomotive (engines and wagons bridge and iron structures) factories were the M\u00c1VAG company in Budapest (steam engines and wagons) and the Ganz company in Budapest (steam engines, wagons, the production of electric locomotives and electric trams started from 1894). and the R\u00c1BA Company in Gy\u0151r.\nInfrastructure.\nTelecommunication.\nTelegraph.\nThe first telegraph connection (Vienna \u2013 Brno \u2013 Prague) had started operation in 1847. In Hungarian territory the first telegraph stations were opened in Pressburg (\"Pozsony\", today's Bratislava) in December 1847 and in Buda in 1848. The first telegraph connection between Vienna and Pest\u2013Buda (later Budapest) was constructed in 1850, and Vienna\u2013Zagreb in 1850.\nAustria subsequently joined a telegraph union with German states. In the Kingdom of Hungary, 2,406 telegraph post offices operated in 1884. By 1914 the number of telegraph offices reached 3,000 in post offices and further 2,400 were installed in the railway stations of the Kingdom of Hungary.\nTelephone.\nThe first telephone exchange was opened in Zagreb (8 January 1881), the second was in Budapest (1 May 1881), and the third was opened in Vienna (3 June 1881). Initially telephony was available in the homes of individual subscribers, companies and offices. Public telephone stations appeared in the 1890s, and they quickly became widespread in post offices and railway stations. Austria\u2013Hungary had 568\u00a0million telephone calls in 1913; only two Western European countries had more phone calls: the German Empire and the United Kingdom. The Austro-Hungarian Empire was followed by France with 396\u00a0million telephone calls and Italy with 230\u00a0million phone calls. In 1916, there were 366\u00a0million telephone calls in Cisleithania, among them 8.4\u00a0million long distant calls. All telephone exchanges of the cities, towns and larger villages in Transleithania were linked until 1893. By 1914, more than 2000 settlements had telephone exchange in Kingdom of Hungary.\nElectronic Audio Broadcasting.\nThe Telefon H\u00edrmond\u00f3 (Telephone Herald) news and entertainment service was introduced in Budapest in 1893. Two decades before the introduction of radio broadcasting, people could listen to political, economic and sports news, cabaret, music and opera in Budapest daily. It operated over a special type of telephone exchange system.\nTransport.\nRailways.\nBy 1913, the combined length of the railway tracks of the Austrian Empire and Kingdom of Hungary reached . In Western Europe only Germany had more extended railway network (); the Austro-Hungarian Empire was followed by France (), the United Kingdom (), Italy () and Spain ().\nRailway network of the Austrian Empire.\nRail transport expanded rapidly in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Its predecessor state, the Habsburg Empire, had built a substantial core of railways in the west, originating from Vienna, by 1841. Austria's first steam railway from Vienna to Moravia with its terminus in Galicia (Bochnie) was opened in 1839. The first train travelled from Vienna to Lundenburg (B\u0159eclav) on 6 June 1839 and one month later between the imperial capital in Vienna and the capital of Moravia Br\u00fcnn (Brno) on 7 July. At that point, the government realized the military possibilities of rail and began to invest heavily in construction. Pozsony (Bratislava), Budapest, Prague, Krak\u00f3w, Graz, Laibach (Ljubljana) and Venedig (Venice) became linked to the main network. By 1854, the empire had almost of track, about 60\u201370% of it in state hands. The government then began to sell off large portions of track to private investors to recoup some of its investments and because of the financial strains of the 1848 Revolution and of the Crimean War.\nFrom 1854 to 1879, private interests conducted almost all rail construction. What would become Cisleithania gained of track, and Hungary built of track. During this time, many new areas joined the railway system and the existing rail networks gained connections and interconnections. This period marked the beginning of widespread rail transportation in Austria\u2013Hungary, and also the integration of transportation systems in the area. Railways allowed the empire to integrate its economy far more than previously possible, when transportation depended on rivers.\nAfter 1879, the Austrian and the Hungarian governments slowly began to renationalize their rail networks, largely because of the sluggish pace of development during the worldwide depression of the 1870s. Between 1879 and 1900, more than of railways were built in Cisleithania and Hungary. Most of this constituted \"filling in\" of the existing network, although some areas, primarily in the far east, gained rail connections for the first time. The railway reduced transportation costs throughout the empire, opening new markets for products from other lands of the Dual Monarchy. In 1914, of a total of of railway tracks in Austria, (82%) were state-owned.\nRailway network in the Kingdom of Hungary.\nThe first Hungarian steam locomotive railway line was opened on 15 July 1846 between Pest and V\u00e1c. In 1890 most large Hungarian private railway companies were nationalized as a consequence of the poor management of private companies, except the strong Austrian-owned Kaschau-Oderberg Railway (KsOd) and the Austrian-Hungarian Southern Railway (SB/DV). They also joined the zone tariff system of the M\u00c1V (Hungarian State Railways). By 1910, the total length of the rail networks of Hungarian Kingdom reached , the Hungarian network linked more than 1,490 settlements. Nearly half (52%) of the empire's railways were built in Hungary, thus the railroad density there became higher than that of Cisleithania. This has ranked Hungarian railways the 6th most dense in the world (ahead of Germany and France).\nA set of four commuter rail lines were built in Budapest, the BH\u00c9V: R\u00e1ckeve line (1887), Szentendre line (1888), G\u00f6d\u00f6ll\u0151 line (1888), Csepel line (1912)\nMetropolitan transit systems.\nTramway lines in the cities.\nHorse-drawn tramways appeared in the first half of the 19th century. Between the 1850s and 1880s many were built : Vienna (1865), Budapest (1866), Brno (1869), Trieste (1876). Steam trams appeared in the late 1860s. The electrification of tramways started in the late 1880s. The first electrified tramway in Austria\u2013Hungary was built in Budapest in 1887.\nElectric tramway lines in the Austrian Empire:\nElectric tramway lines in the Kingdom of Hungary:\nUnderground.\nThe Budapest Metro Line 1 (originally the \"Franz Joseph Underground Electric Railway Company\") is the second oldest underground railway in the world (the first being the London Underground's Metropolitan Line and the third being Glasgow), and the first on the European mainland. It was built from 1894 to 1896 and opened on 2 May 1896. In 2002, it was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.\nThe M1 line became an IEEE Milestone due to the radically new innovations in its era: \"Among the railway\u2019s innovative elements were bidirectional tram cars; electric lighting in the subway stations and tram cars; and an overhead wire structure instead of a third-rail system for power.\"\nCanals and river regulations.\nIn 1900 the engineer C. Wagenf\u00fchrer drew up plans to link the Danube and the Adriatic Sea by a canal from Vienna to Trieste. It was born from the desire of Austria\u2013Hungary to have a direct link to the Adriatic Sea but was never constructed.\nRegulation of the lower Danube and the Iron Gates.\nIn 1831 a plan had already been drafted to make the passage navigable, at the initiative of the Hungarian politician Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi. Finally G\u00e1bor Baross, Hungary's \"Iron Minister\", succeeded in financing this project. The riverbed rocks and the associated rapids made the gorge valley an infamous passage for shipping. In German, the passage is still known as the Kataraktenstrecke, even though the cataracts are gone. Near the actual \"Iron Gates\" strait the Prigrada rock was the most important obstacle until 1896: the river widened considerably here and the water level was consequently low. Upstream, the Greben rock near the \"Kazan\" gorge was notorious.\nRegulation of the Tisza River.\nThe length of the Tisza in Hungary used to be . It flowed through the Great Hungarian Plain, which is one of the largest flat areas in central Europe. Since plains can cause a river to flow very slowly, the Tisza used to follow a path with many curves and turns, which led to many large floods in the area.\nAfter several small-scale attempts, Istv\u00e1n Sz\u00e9chenyi organised the \"regulation of the Tisza\" (Hungarian: a Tisza szab\u00e1lyoz\u00e1sa) which started on 27 August 1846, and substantially ended in 1880. The new length of the river in Hungary was ( total), with of \"dead channels\" and of new riverbed. The resultant length of the flood-protected river comprises (out of of all Hungarian protected rivers).\nShipping and ports.\nThe most important seaport was Trieste (today part of Italy), where the Austrian merchant marine was based. Two major shipping companies (Austrian Lloyd and Austro-Americana) and several shipyards were located there. From 1815 to 1866, Venice had been part of the Habsburg empire. The loss of Venice prompted the development of the Austrian merchant marine. By 1913, the commercial marine of Austria, comprised 16,764 vessels with a tonnage of 471,252, and crews number-ing 45,567. Of the total (1913) 394 of 422,368 tons were steamers, and 16,370 of 48,884 tons were sailing vessels The Austrian Lloyd was one of the biggest ocean shipping companies of the time. Prior to the beginning of World War I, the company owned 65 middle-sized and large steamers. The Austro-Americana owned one third of this number, including the biggest Austrian passenger ship, the SS \"Kaiser Franz Joseph I\". In comparison to the Austrian Lloyd, the Austro-American concentrated on destinations in North and South America. The Austro-Hungarian Navy became much more significant than previously, as industrialization provided sufficient revenues to develop it. The ships of the Austro-Hungarian navy were built in Trieste's shipyards. Pola (Pula, today part of Croatia) was also especially significant for the navy.\nThe most important seaport for the Hungarian part of the monarchy was Fiume (Rijeka, today part of Croatia), where the Hungarian shipping companies, such as the Adria, operated. On the Danube, the DDSG had established the \u00d3buda Shipyard on the Hungarian Haj\u00f3gy\u00e1ri Island in 1835. The largest Hungarian shipbuilding company was the Ganz-Danubius. The commercial marine of the Kingdom of Hungary in 1913 comprised 545 vessels of 144,433 tons, and crews numbering 3,217. Of the total number of vessels 134,000 of 142,539 tons were steamers, and 411 of 1,894 tons were sailing vessels. The first Danubian steamer company, Donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft (DDSG), was the largest inland shipping company in the world until the collapse of Austria-Hungary.\nMilitary.\nThe Austro-Hungarian Army was under the command of Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen (1817\u20131895), an old-fashioned bureaucrat who opposed modernization. The military system of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy was similar in both states, and rested since 1868 upon the principle of the universal and personal obligation of the citizen to bear arms. Its military force was composed of the common army; the special armies, namely the Austrian Landwehr, and the Hungarian Honved, which were separate national institutions, and the Landsturm or levy-en masse. As stated above, the common army stood under the administration of the joint minister of war, while the special armies were under the administration of the respective ministries of national defence. The yearly contingent of recruits for the army was fixed by the military bills voted on by the Austrian and Hungarian parliaments and was generally determined on the basis of the population, according to the last census returns. It amounted in 1905 to 103,100 men, of which Austria furnished 59,211 men, and Hungary 43,889. Besides 10,000 men were annually allotted to the Austrian Landwehr, and 12,500 to the Hungarian Honved. The term of service was two years (three years in the cavalry) with the colours, seven or eight in the reserve and two in the Landwehr; in the case of men not drafted to the active army the same total period of service was spent in various special reserves.\nThe common minister of war was the head for the administration of all military affairs, except those of the Austrian Landwehr and of the Hungarian Honved, which were committed to the ministries for national defence of the two respective states. But the supreme command of the army was nominally vested in the monarch, who had the power to take all measures regarding the whole army. In practice, the emperor's nephew Archduke Albrecht was his chief military advisor and made the policy decisions.\nThe Austro-Hungarian navy was mainly a coast defence force, and also included a flotilla of monitors for the Danube. It was administered by the naval department of the ministry of war.\nWorld War I.\nPreludes: Bosnia and Herzegovina.\nRussian Pan-Slavic organizations sent aid to the Balkan rebels and so pressured the tsar's government to declare war on the Ottoman Empire in 1877 in the name of protecting Orthodox Christians. Unable to mediate between the Ottoman Empire and Russia over the control of Serbia, Austria\u2013Hungary declared neutrality when the conflict between the two powers escalated into a war. With help from Romania and Greece, Russia defeated the Ottomans and with the Treaty of San Stefano tried to create a large pro-Russian Bulgaria. This treaty sparked an international uproar that almost resulted in a general European war. Austria\u2013Hungary and Britain feared that a large Bulgaria would become a Russian satellite that would enable the tsar to dominate the Balkans. British prime minister Benjamin Disraeli moved warships into position against Russia to halt the advance of Russian influence in the eastern Mediterranean so close to Britain's route through the Suez Canal.\nThe Congress of Berlin rolled back the Russian victory by partitioning the large Bulgarian state that Russia had carved out of Ottoman territory and denying any part of Bulgaria full independence from the Ottomans. Austria occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina as a way of gaining power in the Balkans. Serbia, Montenegro and Romania became fully independent. Nonetheless, the Balkans remained a site of political unrest with teeming ambition for independence and great power rivalries. At the Congress of Berlin in 1878 Gyula Andr\u00e1ssy (Minister of Foreign Affairs) managed to force Russia to retreat from further demands in the Balkans. As a result, Greater Bulgaria was broken up and Serbian independence was guaranteed. In that year, with Britain's support, Austria\u2013Hungary stationed troops in Bosnia to prevent the Russians from expanding into nearby Serbia. In another measure to keep the Russians out of the Balkans, Austria\u2013Hungary formed an alliance, the Mediterranean Entente, with Britain and Italy in 1887 and concluded mutual defence pacts with Germany in 1879 and Romania in 1883 against a possible Russian attack. Following the Congress of Berlin the European powers attempted to guarantee stability through a complex series of alliances and treaties.\nAnxious about Balkan instability and Russian aggression, and to counter French interests in Europe, Austria\u2013Hungary forged a defensive alliance with Germany in October 1879 and in May 1882. In October 1882 Italy joined this partnership in the Triple Alliance largely because of Italy's imperial rivalries with France. Tensions between Russia and Austria\u2013Hungary remained high, so Bismarck replaced the League of the Three Emperors with the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia to keep the Habsburgs from recklessly starting a war over Pan-Slavism. The Sand\u017eak-Ra\u0161ka / Novibazar region was under Austro-Hungarian occupation between 1878 and 1909, when it was returned to the Ottoman Empire, before being ultimately divided between kingdoms of Montenegro and Serbia.\nOn the heels of the Great Balkan Crisis, Austro-Hungarian forces occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina in August 1878 and the monarchy eventually annexed Bosnia and Herzegovina in October 1908 as a common holding of Cisleithania and Transleithania under the control of the Imperial &amp; Royal finance ministry rather than attaching it to either territorial government. The annexation in 1908 led some in Vienna to contemplate combining Bosnia and Herzegovina with Croatia to form a third Slavic component of the monarchy. The deaths of Franz Joseph's brother, Maximilian (1867), and his only son, Rudolf, made the Emperor's nephew, Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne. The Archduke was rumoured to have been an advocate for this trialism as a means to limit the power of the Hungarian aristocracy.\nStatus of Bosnia-Herzegovina.\nA proclamation issued on the occasion of its annexation to the Habsburg Monarchy in 1908 promised these lands constitutional institutions, which should secure to their inhabitants full civil rights and a share in the management of their own affairs by means of a local representative assembly. In performance of this promise a constitution was promulgated in 1910. This included a Territorial Statute (Landesstatut) with the setting up of a Territorial Diet, regulations for the election and procedure of the Diet, a law of associations, a law of public meetings, and a law dealing with the district councils. According to this statute Bosnia-Herzegovina formed a single administrative territory under the responsible direction and supervision of the Ministry of Finance of the Dual Monarchy in Vienna. The administration of the country, together with the carrying out of the laws, devolved upon the Territorial Government in Sarajevo, which was subordinate and responsible to the Common Ministry of Finance. The existing judicial and administrative authorities of the Territory retained their previous organization and functions. That statute introduced the modern rights and laws in Bosnia \u2013 Herzegovina, and it guaranteed generally the civil rights of the inhabitants of the Territory, namely citizenship, personal liberty, protection by the competent judicial authorities, liberty of creed and conscience, preservation of the national individuality and language, freedom of speech, freedom of learning and education, inviolability of the domicile, secrecy of posts and telegraphs, inviolability of property, the right of petition, and finally the right of holding meetings.\nThe Diet (Sabor) of Bosnia-Herzegovina set up consisted of a single Chamber, elected on the principle of the representation of interests. It numbered 92 members. Of these 20 consisted of representatives of all the religious confessions, the president of the Supreme Court, the president of the Chamber of Advocates, the president of the Chamber of Commerce, and the mayor of Sarajevo. In addition to these were 72 deputies, elected by three curiae or electoral groups. The first curia included the large landowners, the highest taxpayers, and people who had reached a certain standard of education without regard to the amount they paid in taxes. To the second curia belonged inhabitants of the towns not qualified to vote in the first; to the third, country dwellers disqualified in the same way. With this curial system was combined the grouping of the mandates and of the electors according to the three dominant creeds (Catholic, Serbian Orthodox, Muslim). To the adherents of other creeds the right was conceded of voting with one or other of the religious electoral bodies within the curia to which they belonged.\nSarajevo assassination.\nOn 28 June 1914, Archduke Franz Ferdinand visited the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. A group of six assassins (Cvjetko Popovi\u0107, Gavrilo Princip, Muhamed Mehmedba\u0161i\u0107, Nedeljko \u010cabrinovi\u0107, Trifko Grabe\u017e, Vaso \u010cubrilovi\u0107) from the nationalist group Mlada Bosna, supplied by the Black Hand, had gathered on the street where the Archduke's motorcade would pass. \u010cabrinovi\u0107 threw a grenade at the car, but missed. It injured some people nearby, and Franz Ferdinand's convoy could carry on. The other assassins failed to act as the cars drove past them quickly. About an hour later, when Franz Ferdinand was returning from a visit at the Sarajevo Hospital, the convoy took a wrong turn into a street where Gavrilo Princip by coincidence stood. With a pistol, Princip shot and killed Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie. The reaction among the Austrian people was mild, almost indifferent. As historian Z. A. B. Zeman later wrote, \"the event almost failed to make any impression whatsoever. On Sunday and Monday [June 28 and 29], the crowds in Vienna listened to music and drank wine, as if nothing had happened.\"\nEscalation of violence in Bosnia.\nThe assassination excessively intensified the existing traditional religion-based ethnic hostilities in Bosnia. However, in Sarajevo itself, Austrian authorities encouraged violence against the Serb residents, which resulted in the Anti-Serb riots of Sarajevo, in which Catholic Croats and Bosnian Muslims killed two and damaged numerous Serb-owned buildings. Writer Ivo Andri\u0107 referred to the violence as the \"Sarajevo frenzy of hate.\" Violent actions against ethnic Serbs were organized not only in Sarajevo but also in many other larger Austro-Hungarian cities in modern-day Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina. Austro-Hungarian authorities in Bosnia and Herzegovina imprisoned and extradited approximately 5,500 prominent Serbs, 700 to 2,200 of whom died in prison. 460 Serbs were sentenced to death and a predominantly Muslim special militia known as the \"Schutzkorps\" was established and carried out the persecution of Serbs.\nDecision for war.\nWhile the empire's military spending had not even doubled since the 1878 Congress of Berlin, Germany's spending had risen fivefold, and the British, Russian, and French expenditures threefold. The empire had lost ethnic Italian areas to Piedmont because of nationalist movements that had swept through Italy, and many Austro-Hungarians perceived as imminent the threat of losing to Serbia the southern territories inhabited by Slavs. Serbia had recently gained considerable territory in the Second Balkan War of 1913, causing much distress in government circles in Vienna and Budapest. Former ambassador and foreign minister Count Alois Aehrenthal had assumed that any future war would be in the Balkan region.\nHungarian prime minister and political scientist Istv\u00e1n Tisza opposed the expansion of the monarchy in the Balkans (see Bosnian crisis in 1908) because \"the Dual Monarchy already had too many Slavs\", which would further threaten the integrity of the Dual Monarchy. In March 1914, Tisza wrote a memorandum to Emperor Franz Joseph with a strongly apocalyptic, predictive and embittered tone. He used the hitherto unknown word \"Weltkrieg\" (meaning World War). \"It is my firm conviction that Germany's two neighbors [Russia and France] are carefully proceeding with military preparations, but will not start the war so long as they have not attained a grouping of the Balkan states against us that confronts the monarchy with an attack from three sides and pins down the majority of our forces on our eastern and southern front.\"\nOn the day of the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Tisza immediately traveled to Vienna where he met Minister of Foreign Affairs Count Leopold Berchtold and Army Commander Count Franz Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf. They proposed to solve the dispute with arms, attacking Serbia. Tisza proposed to give the government of Serbia time to take a stand as to whether it was involved in the organisation of the murder and proposed a peaceful resolution, arguing that the international situation would settle soon. Returning to Budapest, he wrote to Emperor Franz Joseph saying he would not take any responsibility for the armed conflict because there was no proof that Serbia had plotted the assassination. Tisza opposed a war with Serbia, stating (correctly, as it turned out) that any war with the Serbs was bound to trigger a war with Russia and hence a general European war. He did not trust in the Italian alliance, due to the political aftermath of the Second Italian War of Independence. He thought that even a successful Austro-Hungarian war would be disastrous for the integrity of Kingdom of Hungary, where Hungary would be the next victim of Austrian politics. After a successful war against Serbia, Tisza foresaw a possible Austrian military attack against the Kingdom of Hungary, where the Austrians want to break up the territory of Hungary.\nSome members of the government, such as Count Franz Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf, had wanted to confront the resurgent Serbian nation for some years in a preventive war, but the Emperor, 84 years old and an enemy of all adventures, disapproved.\nThe foreign ministry of Austro-Hungarian Empire sent ambassador L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Sz\u0151gy\u00e9ny to Potsdam, where he inquired about the standpoint of the German Emperor on 5 July.\nSz\u0151gy\u00e9ny described what happened in a secret report to Vienna later that day:\nBut now the leaders of Austria\u2013Hungary, especially General Count Leopold von Berchtold, backed by its ally Germany, decided to confront Serbia militarily before it could incite a revolt; using the assassination as an excuse, they presented a list of ten demands called the July Ultimatum, expecting Serbia would never accept. When Serbia accepted nine of the ten demands but only partially accepted the remaining one, Austria\u2013Hungary declared war. Franz Joseph I finally followed the urgent counsel of his top advisers.\nOver the course of July and August 1914, these events caused the start of World War I, as Russia mobilized in support of Serbia, setting off a series of counter-mobilizations. In support of his German ally, on Thursday, 6 August 1914, Emperor Franz Joseph signed the declaration of war on Russia. Italy initially remained neutral, although it had an alliance with Austria\u2013Hungary. In 1915, it switched to the side of the Entente powers, hoping to gain territory from its former ally.\nWartime foreign policy.\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire played a relatively passive diplomatic role in the war, as it was increasingly dominated and controlled by Germany. The only goal was to punish Serbia and try to stop the ethnic breakup of the Empire, and it completely failed. Instead as the war went on the ethnic unity declined; the Allies encouraged breakaway demands from minorities and the Empire faced disintegration. Starting in late 1916 the new Emperor Karl removed the pro-German officials and opened peace overtures to the Allies, whereby the entire war could be ended by compromise, or perhaps Austria would make a separate peace from Germany. The main effort was vetoed by Italy, which had been promised large slices of Austria for joining the Allies in 1915. Austria was only willing to turn over the Trentino region but nothing more. Karl was seen as a defeatist, which weakened his standing at home and with both the Allies and Germany.\nAs the Imperial economy collapsed into severe hardship and even starvation, its multi-ethnic army lost its morale and was increasingly hard-pressed to hold its line. In the capital cities of Vienna and Budapest, the leftist and liberal movements and opposition parties strengthened and supported the separatism of ethnic minorities. As it became apparent that the Allies would win the war, nationalist movements, which had previously been calling for a greater degree of autonomy for their majority areas, started demanding full independence. The Emperor had lost much of his power to rule, as his realm disintegrated.\nHomefront.\nThe heavily rural Empire did have a small industrial base, but its major contribution was manpower and food. Nevertheless, Austria\u2013Hungary was more urbanized (25%) than its actual opponents in the First World War, like the Russian Empire (13.4%), Serbia (13.2%) or Romania (18.8%). Furthermore, the Austro-Hungarian Empire had also more industrialized economy and higher GDP per capita than the Kingdom of Italy, which was economically the far most developed actual opponent of the Empire.\nOn the home front, food grew scarcer and scarcer, as did heating fuel. The hog population fell 90 percent, as the dwindling supplies of ham and bacon percent of the Army. Hungary, with its heavy agricultural base, was somewhat better fed. The Army conquered productive agricultural areas in Romania and elsewhere, but refused to allow food shipments to civilians back home. Morale fell every year, and the diverse nationalities gave up on the Empire and looked for ways to establish their own nation states.\nInflation soared, from an index of 129 in 1914 to 1589 in 1918, wiping out the cash savings of the middle-class. In terms of war damage to the economy, the war used up about 20 percent of the GDP. The dead soldiers amounted to about four percent of the 1914 labor force, and the wounded ones to another six percent. Compared all the major countries in the war, the death and casualty rate was toward the high-end regarding the present-day territory of Austra.\nBy summer 1918, \"Green Cadres\" of army deserters formed armed bands in the hills of Croatia-Slavonia and civil authority disintegrated. By late October violence and massive looting erupted and there were efforts to form peasant republics. However, the Croatian political leadership was focused on creating a new state (Yugoslavia) and worked with the advancing Serbian army to impose control and end the uprisings.\nMilitary events.\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire conscripted 7.8\u00a0million soldiers during the WW1.\nGeneral von H\u00f6tzendorf was the Chief of the Austro-Hungarian General Staff. Franz Joseph I, who was much too old to command the army, appointed Archduke Friedrich von \u00d6sterreich-Teschen as Supreme Army Commander (Armeeoberkommandant), but asked him to give Von H\u00f6tzendorf freedom to take any decisions. Von H\u00f6tzendorf remained in effective command of the military forces until Emperor Karl I took the supreme command himself in late 1916 and dismissed Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf in 1917. Meanwhile, economic conditions on the homefront deteriorated rapidly. The Empire depended on agriculture, and agriculture depended on the heavy labor of millions of men who were now in the Army. Food production fell, the transportation system became overcrowded, and industrial production could not successfully handle the overwhelming need for munitions. Germany provided a great deal of help, but it was not enough. Furthermore, the political instability of the multiple ethnic groups of Empire now ripped apart any hope for national consensus in support of the war. Increasingly there was a demand for breaking up the Empire and setting up autonomous national states based on historic language-based cultures. The new Emperor sought peace terms from the Allies, but his initiatives were vetoed by Italy.\nSerbian front 1914\u20131916.\nAt the start of the war, the army was divided into two: the smaller part attacked Serbia while the larger part fought against the formidable Imperial Russian Army. The invasion of Serbia in 1914 was a disaster: by the end of the year, the Austro-Hungarian Army had taken no territory, but had lost 227,000 out of a total force of 450,000 men. However, in the autumn of 1915, the Serbian Army was defeated by the Central Powers, which led to the occupation of Serbia. Near the end of 1915, in a massive rescue operation involving more than 1,000 trips made by Italian, French and British steamers, 260,000 Serb surviving soldiers were transported to Brindisi and Corfu, where they waited for the chance of the victory of Allied Powers to reclaim their country. Corfu hosted the Serbian government in exile after the collapse of Serbia and served as a supply base to the Greek front. In April 1916 a large number of Serbian troops were transported in British and French naval vessels from Corfu to mainland Greece. The contingent numbering over 120,000 relieved a much smaller army at the Macedonian front and fought alongside British and French troops.\nRussian front 1914\u20131917.\nOn the Eastern front, the war started out equally poorly. The Austro-Hungarian Army was defeated at the Battle of Lemberg and the great fortress city of Przemy\u015bl was besieged and fell in March 1915. The Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive started as a minor German offensive to relieve the pressure of the Russian numerical superiority on the Austro-Hungarians, but the cooperation of the Central Powers resulted in huge Russian losses and the total collapse of the Russian lines and their long retreat into Russia. The Russian Third Army perished. In summer 1915, the Austro-Hungarian Army, under a unified command with the Germans, participated in the successful Gorlice\u2013Tarn\u00f3w Offensive. From June 1916, the Russians focused their attacks on the Austro-Hungarian army in the Brusilov Offensive, recognizing the numerical inferiority of the Austro-Hungarian army. By the end of September 1916, Austria\u2013Hungary mobilized and concentrated new divisions, and the successful Russian advance was halted and slowly repelled; but the Austrian armies took heavy losses (about 1\u00a0million men) and never recovered. The Battle of Zborov (1917) was the first significant action of the Czechoslovak Legions, who fought for the independence of Czechoslovakia against the Austro-Hungarian army. However the huge losses in men and material inflicted on the Russians during the offensive contributed greatly to the revolutions of 1917, and it caused an economic crash in the Russian Empire.\nItalian front 1915\u20131918.\nIn May 1915, Italy attacked Austria\u2013Hungary. Italy was the only military opponent of Austria\u2013Hungary which had a similar degree of industrialization and economic level; moreover, her army was numerous (\u22481,000,000 men were immediately fielded), but suffered from poor leadership, training and organization. Chief of Staff Luigi Cadorna marched his army towards the Isonzo river, hoping to seize Ljubljana, and to eventually threaten Vienna. However, the Royal Italian Army were halted on the river, where four battles took place over five months (23 June \u2013 2 December 1915). The fight was extremely bloody and exhausting for both the contenders.\nOn 15 May 1916, the Austrian Chief of Staff Conrad von H\u00f6tzendorf launched the \"Strafexpedition\" (\"punitive expedition\"): the Austrians broke through the opposing front and occupied the Asiago plateau. The Italians managed to resist and in a counteroffensive seized Gorizia on 9 August. Nonetheless, they had to stop on the Carso, a few kilometres away from the border. At this point, several months of indecisive trench warfare ensued (analogous to the Western front). As the Russian Empire collapsed as a result of the Bolshevik Revolution and Russians ended their involvement in the war, Germans and Austrians were able to move on the Western and Southern fronts much manpower from the erstwhile Eastern fighting.\nOn 24 October 1917, Austrians (now enjoying decisive German support) attacked at Caporetto using new infiltration tactics; although they advanced more than in the direction of Venice and gained considerable supplies, they were halted and could not cross the Piave river. Italy, although suffering massive casualties, recovered from the blow, and a coalition government under Vittorio Emanuele Orlando was formed. Italy also enjoyed support by the Entente powers: by 1918, large amounts of war materials and a few auxiliary American, British, and French divisions arrived in the Italian battle zone. Cadorna was replaced by General Armando Diaz; under his command, the Italians retook the initiative and won the decisive Battle of the Piave river (15\u201323 June 1918), in which some 60,000 Austrian and 43,000 Italian soldiers were killed. The multiethnic Austro-Hungarian Empire started to disintegrate, leaving its army alone on the battlefields. The final battle was at Vittorio Veneto; after 4 days of stiff resistance, Italian troops crossed the Piave River, and after losing 90,000 men the defeated Austrian troops retreated in disarray pursued by the Italians. The Italians captured 448,000 Austrian-Hungarian soldiers (about one-third of the imperial-royal army), 24 of whom were generals, 5,600 cannons and mortars, and 4,000 machine guns. The military breakdown also marked the start of the rebellion for the numerous ethnicities who made up the multiethnic Empire, as they refused to keep on fighting for a cause that now appeared senseless. These events marked the end of Austria\u2013Hungary, which collapsed on 31 October 1918. The armistice was signed at Villa Giusti on 3 November.\nRomanian front 1916\u20131917.\nOn 27 August 1916, Romania declared war against Austria\u2013Hungary. The Romanian Army crossed the borders of Eastern Hungary (Transylvania), and despite initial successes, by November 1916, the Central Powers formed by the Austro-Hungarian, German, Bulgarian, and Ottoman armies, had defeated the Romanian and Russian armies of the Entente Powers, and occupied the southern part of Romania (including Oltenia, Muntenia and Dobruja). Within 3 months of the war, the Central Powers came near Bucharest, the Romanian capital city. On 6 December, the Central Powers captured Bucharest, and part of the population moved to the unoccupied Romanian territory, in Moldavia, together with the Romanian government, royal court and public authorities, which relocated to Ia\u0219i.\nIn 1917, after several defensive victories (managing to stop the German-Austro-Hungarian advance), with Russia's withdrawal from the war following the October Revolution, Romania was forced to drop out of the war.\nWhereas the German army realized it needed close cooperation from the homefront, Habsburg officers saw themselves as entirely separate from the civilian world, and superior to it. When they occupied productive areas, such as southern Romania, they seized food stocks and other supplies for their own purposes and blocked any shipments intended for civilians back in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The result was that the officers lived well, as the civilians began to starve. Vienna even transferred training units to Serbia and Poland for the sole purpose of feeding them. In all, the Army obtained about 15 percent of its cereal needs from occupied territories.\nRole of Hungary.\nAlthough the Kingdom of Hungary composed only 42% of the population of Austria\u2013Hungary, the thin majority \u2013 more than 3.8\u00a0million soldiers \u2013 of the Austro-Hungarian armed forces were conscripted from the Kingdom of Hungary during the First World War. Roughly 600,000 soldiers were killed in action, and 700,000 soldiers were wounded in the war.\nAustria\u2013Hungary held on for years, as the Hungarian half provided sufficient supplies for the military to continue to wage war. This was shown in a transition of power after which the Hungarian prime minister, Count Istv\u00e1n Tisza, and foreign minister, Count Istv\u00e1n Buri\u00e1n, had decisive influence over the internal and external affairs of the monarchy. By late 1916, food supply from Hungary became intermittent and the government sought an armistice with the Entente powers. However, this failed as Britain and France no longer had any regard for the integrity of the monarchy because of Austro-Hungarian support for Germany.\nAnalysis of defeat.\nThe setbacks that the Austrian army suffered in 1914 and 1915 can be attributed to a large extent by the incompetence of the Austrian high command. After attacking Serbia, its forces soon had to be withdrawn to protect its eastern frontier against Russia's invasion, while German units were engaged in fighting on the Western Front. This resulted in a greater than expected loss of men in the invasion of Serbia. Furthermore, it became evident that the Austrian high command had had no plans for possible continental war and that the army and navy were also ill-equipped to handle such a conflict.\nFrom 1916, the Austro-Hungarian war effort became more and more subordinated to the direction of German planners. The Austrians viewed the German army favorably, on the other hand by 1916 the general belief in Germany was that Germany, in its alliance with Austria\u2013Hungary, was \"shackled to a corpse\". The operational capability of the Austro-Hungarian army was seriously affected by supply shortages, low morale and a high casualty rate, and by the army's composition of multiple ethnicities with different languages and customs.\nThe last two successes for the Austrians, the Romanian Offensive and the Caporetto Offensive, were German-assisted operations. As the Dual Monarchy became more politically unstable, it became more and more dependent on German assistance. The majority of its people, other than Hungarians and German Austrians, became increasingly restless.\nIn 1917, the Eastern front of the Entente Powers completely collapsed.\nThe Austro-Hungarian Empire then withdrew from all defeated countries. By 1918, the economic situation had deteriorated. Leftist and pacifist political movements organized strikes in factories, and uprisings in the army had become commonplace. During the Italian battles, the Czechoslovaks and Southern Slavs declared their independence. On 31 October Hungary ended the personal union with Austria, officially dissolving the Monarchy. At the last Italian offensive, the Austro-Hungarian Army took to the field without any food and munition supply and fought without any political supports for a \"de facto\" non-existent empire. On the end of the decisive joint Italian, British and French offensive at Vittorio Veneto, the disintegrated Austria\u2013Hungary signed the Armistice of Villa Giusti on 3 November 1918.\nThe government had failed badly on the homefront. Historian Alexander Watson reports:\nDissolution.\nThe Austro-Hungarian Monarchy collapsed with dramatic speed in the autumn of 1918. In the capital cities of Vienna and Budapest, the leftist and liberal movements and politicians (the opposition parties) strengthened and supported the separatism of ethnic minorities. These leftist or left-liberal pro-Entente maverick parties opposed the monarchy as a form of government and considered themselves internationalist rather than patriotic. Eventually, the German defeat and the minor revolutions in Vienna and Budapest gave political power to the left/liberal political parties. As it became apparent that the Allied powers would win World War I, nationalist movements, which had previously been calling for a greater degree of autonomy for various areas, started pressing for full independence. The Emperor had lost much of his power to rule, as his realm disintegrated.\nAlexander Watson argues that, \"The Habsburg regime's doom was sealed when Wilson's response to the note, sent two and a half weeks earlier, arrived on 20 October.\" Wilson rejected the continuation of the dual monarchy as a negotiable possibility. As one of his Fourteen Points, President Woodrow Wilson demanded that the nationalities of Austria\u2013Hungary have the \"freest opportunity to autonomous development\". In response, Emperor Karl I agreed to reconvene the Imperial Parliament in 1917 and allow the creation of a confederation with each national group exercising self-governance. However, the leaders of these national groups rejected the idea; they deeply distrusted Vienna and were now determined to get independence.\nOn 14 October 1918, Foreign Minister Baron Istv\u00e1n Buri\u00e1n von Rajecz asked for an armistice based on the Fourteen Points. In an apparent attempt to demonstrate good faith, Emperor Karl issued a proclamation (\"Imperial Manifesto of 16 October 1918\") two days later which would have significantly altered the structure of the Austrian half of the monarchy. The Polish majority regions of Galicia and Lodomeria were to be granted the option of seceding from the empire, and it was understood that they would join their ethnic brethren in Russia and Germany in resurrecting a Polish state. The rest of Cisleithania was transformed into a federal union composed of four parts\u2014German, Czech, South Slav and Ukrainian. Each of these was to be governed by a national council that would negotiate the future of the empire with Vienna. Trieste was to receive a special status. No such proclamation could be issued in Hungary, where Hungarian aristocrats still believed they could subdue other nationalities and maintain the \"Holy Kingdom of St. Stephen\".\nIt was a dead letter. Four days later, on 18 October, United States Secretary of State Robert Lansing replied that the Allies were now committed to the causes of the Czechs, Slovaks and South Slavs. Therefore, Lansing said, autonomy for the nationalities \u2013 the tenth of the Fourteen Points \u2013 was no longer enough and Washington could not deal on the basis of the Fourteen Points anymore. In fact, a Czechoslovak provisional government had joined the Allies on 14 October. The South Slavs in both halves of the monarchy had already declared in favor of uniting with Serbia in a large South Slav state by way of the 1917 Corfu Declaration signed by members of the Yugoslav Committee. Indeed, the Croatians had begun disregarding orders from Budapest earlier in October.\nThe Lansing note was, in effect, the death certificate of Austria\u2013Hungary. The national councils had already begun acting more or less as provisional governments of independent countries. With defeat in the war imminent after the Italian offensive in the Battle of Vittorio Veneto on 24 October, Czech politicians peacefully took over command in Prague on 28 October (later declared the birthday of Czechoslovakia) and followed up in other major cities in the next few days. On 30 October, the Slovaks followed in Martin. On 29 October, the Slavs in both portions of what remained of Austria\u2013Hungary proclaimed the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs. They also declared that their ultimate intention was to unite with Serbia and Montenegro in a large South Slav state. On the same day, the Czechs and Slovaks formally proclaimed the establishment of Czechoslovakia as an independent state.\nIn Hungary, the most prominent opponent of continued union with Austria, Count Mih\u00e1ly K\u00e1rolyi, seized power in the Aster Revolution on 31 October. Charles was all but forced to appoint K\u00e1rolyi as his Hungarian prime minister. One of K\u00e1rolyi's first acts was to cancel the compromise agreement, officially dissolving the Austro-Hungarian state.\nBy the end of October, there was nothing left of the Habsburg realm but its majority-German Danubian and Alpine provinces, and Karl's authority was being challenged even there by the German-Austrian state council. Karl's last Austrian prime minister, Heinrich Lammasch, concluded that Karl was in an impossible situation, and persuaded Karl that the best course was to relinquish, at least temporarily, his right to exercise sovereign authority.\nConsequences.\nOn 11 November, Karl issued a carefully worded proclamation in which he recognized the Austrian people's right to determine the form of the state and relinquished his right to take part in Austrian state affairs. He also dismissed Lammasch and his government from office and released the officials in the Austrian half of the empire from their oath of loyalty to him. Two days later, he issued a similar proclamation for Hungary. However, he did not abdicate, remaining available in the event the people of either state should recall him. For all intents and purposes, this was the end of the Habsburg rule.\nSince my ascent to the throne, I have been constantly trying to lead my people out of the horrors of war, which I am not responsible for.\nI have not hesitated to restore constitutional life and have opened the way for peoples to develop their own state independently.\nStill filled with unchangeable love for all My peoples, I do not want to oppose the free development of My Person as an obstacle.\nI recognize in advance the decision that German Austria will make regarding its future form of government.\nThe people took over the government through their representatives. I waive any share in state affairs.\nAt the same time, I am releasing My Austrian Government from office.\nMay the people of German Austria create and consolidate the reorganization in harmony and forgiveness. The happiness of my peoples has been the goal of my hottest wishes from the beginning.\nOnly inner peace can heal the wounds of this war.\nSeit meiner thronbesteigung war ich unabl\u00e4ssig bem\u00fcht, Meine Volker aus den Schrecknissen des Krieges herauszuf\u00fchren, an dessen Ausbruch ich keinerlei Schuld trage.\nIch habe nicht gez\u00f6gert, das verfassungsma\u00dfige Leben wieder herzustellen und haben den V\u00f6lkern den Weg zu ihrer selbst\u00e4ndingen staatlichen Entwicklung er\u00f6ffnet.\nNach wie vor von unwandelbarer Liebe f\u00fcr alle Meine V\u00f6lker erf\u00fcllt, will ich ihrer freien Entfaltung Meine Person nicht als Hindernis entgegenstellen.\nIm voraus erkenne ich die Entscheidung an, die Deutsch\u00f6sterreich \u00fcber seine k\u00fcnftige Staatsform trifft.\nDas Volk hat durch seine Vertreter die Regierung \u00fcbernommen. Ich verzichte auf jeden Anteil an den Staatsgesch\u00e4ften.\nGleichzeitig enthebe ich Meine \u00f6sterreichische Regierung ihres Amtes.\nM\u00f6ge das Volk von Deutsch\u00f6sterreich in Eintracht und Vers\u00f6hnlichkeit die Neuordnung schaffen und befestigen. Das Gl\u00fcck Meiner V\u00f6lker war von Anbeginn das Ziel Meiner hei\u00dfesten W\u00fcnsche.\nNur der innere Friede kann die Wunden dieses Krieges heilen.\nKarl's refusal to abdicate was ultimately irrelevant. On the day after he announced his withdrawal from Austria's politics, the German-Austrian National Council proclaimed the Republic of German Austria. K\u00e1rolyi followed suit on 16 November, proclaiming the Hungarian Democratic Republic.\nThe Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (between the victors of World War I and Austria) and the Treaty of Trianon (between the victors and Hungary) regulated the new borders of Austria and Hungary, leaving both as small landlocked states. The Allies assumed without question that the minority nationalities wanted to leave Austria and Hungary, and also allowed them to annex significant blocks of German- and Hungarian-speaking territory. As a result, the Republic of Austria lost roughly 60% of the old Austrian Empire's territory. It also had to drop its plans for union with Germany, as it was not allowed to unite with Germany without League approval. The restored Kingdom of Hungary, which had replaced the republican government in 1920, lost roughly 72% of the pre-war territory of the Kingdom of Hungary.\nThe decisions of the nations of the former Austria\u2013Hungary and of the victors of the Great War, contained in the heavily one-sided treaties, had devastating political and economic effects. The previously rapid economic growth of the Dual Monarchy ground to a halt because the new borders became major economic barriers. All the formerly well-established industries, as well as the infrastructure supporting them, were designed to satisfy the needs of an extensive realm. As a result, the emerging countries were forced to make considerable sacrifices to transform their economies. The treaties created major political unease. As a result of these economic difficulties, extremist movements gained strength; and there was no regional superpower in central Europe.\nThe new Austrian state was, at least on paper, on shakier ground than Hungary. Unlike its former Hungarian partner, Austria had never been a nation in any real sense. While the Austrian state had existed in one form or another for 700 years, it was united only by loyalty to the Habsburgs. With the loss of 60% of the Austrian Empire's prewar territory, Vienna was now an imperial capital without an empire to support it. However, after a brief period of upheaval and the Allies' foreclosure of union with Germany, Austria established itself as a federal republic. Despite the temporary \"Anschluss\" with Nazi Germany, it still survives today. Adolf Hitler cited that all \"Germans\" \u2013 such as him and the others from Austria, etc. \u2013 should be united with Germany.\nBy comparison, Hungary had been a nation and a state for over 900 years. Hungary, however, was severely disrupted by the loss of 72% of its territory, 64% of its population and most of its natural resources. The Hungarian Democratic Republic was short-lived and was temporarily replaced by the communist Hungarian Soviet Republic. Romanian troops ousted B\u00e9la Kun and his communist government during the Hungarian\u2013Romanian War of 1919.\nIn the summer of 1919, a Habsburg, Archduke Joseph August, became regent, but was forced to stand down after only two weeks when it became apparent the Allies would not recognise him. Finally, in March 1920, royal powers were entrusted to a regent, Mikl\u00f3s Horthy, who had been the last commanding admiral of the Austro-Hungarian Navy and had helped organize the counter-revolutionary forces. It was this government that signed the Treaty of Trianon under protest on 4 June 1920 at the Grand Trianon Palace in Versailles, France.\nIn March and again in October 1921, ill-prepared attempts by Karl to regain the throne in Budapest collapsed. The initially wavering Horthy, after receiving threats of intervention from the Allied Powers and the Little Entente, refused his cooperation. Soon afterward, the Hungarian government nullified the Pragmatic Sanction, effectively dethroning the Habsburgs. Two years earlier, Austria had passed the \"Habsburg Law,\" which both dethroned the Habsburgs and banished all Habsburgs from Austrian territory. While Karl was banned from ever returning to Austria again, other Habsburgs could return if they gave up all claims to the throne.\nSubsequently, the British took custody of Karl and removed him and his family to the Portuguese island of Madeira, where he died the following year.\nSuccessor states.\nThe following successor states were formed at the dissolution of the former Austro\u2013Hungarian monarchy:\nAdditionally, the duchies of Bukovina, Transylvania and two-thirds of the Banat were joined to the Kingdom of Romania.\nAustro-Hungarian lands were also ceded to the Kingdom of Italy. The Principality of Liechtenstein, which had formerly looked to Vienna for protection, formed a customs and defense union with Switzerland, and adopted the Swiss currency instead of the Austrian. In April 1919, Vorarlberg \u2013 the westernmost province of Austria \u2013 voted by a large majority to join Switzerland; however, both the Swiss and the Allies disregarded this result.\nTerritorial legacy.\nThe following present-day countries and parts of countries were within the boundaries of Austria\u2013Hungary when the empire was dissolved:\nEmpire of Austria (Cisleithania):\nKingdom of Hungary (Transleithania):\nAustro-Hungarian Condominium\n\"Possessions of the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy\"\nOther parts of Europe had been part of the Habsburg monarchy once but had left it before its dissolution in 1918. Prominent examples are the regions of Lombardy and Veneto in Italy, Silesia in Poland, most of Belgium and Serbia, and parts of northern Switzerland and southwestern Germany.\nThey persuaded the government to search out foreign investment to build up infrastructure such as railroads. Despite these measures, Austria\u2013Hungary remained resolutely monarchist and authoritarian."}

Several folk etymologies are associated with the word: from phrases in Hebrew that mean \"I will create as I speak\", or Aramaic \"I create like the word\" (\u05d0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d0 \u05db\u05d3\u05d1\u05e8\u05d0), to folk etymologies that point to similar words in Latin and Greek such as abraxas or to its similarity to the first four letters of the Greek alphabet (alpha-beta-gamma-delta or \u0391\u0392\u0393\u0394) According to the \"OED Online\", \"no documentation has been found to support any of the various conjectures.\"\nHistory.\nThe first known mention of the word was in the second century AD in a book called \"Liber Medicinalis\" (sometimes known as \"De Medicina Praecepta Saluberrima\") by Serenus Sammonicus, physician to the Roman emperor Caracalla, who in chapter 51 prescribed that malaria sufferers wear an amulet containing the word written in the form of a triangle.\nThe power of the amulet, he claimed, makes lethal diseases go away. Other Roman emperors, including Geta and Severus Alexander, were followers of the medical teachings of Serenus Sammonicus and may have used the incantation as well.\nIt was used as a magical formula by the Gnostics of the sect of Basilides in invoking the aid of beneficent spirits against disease and misfortune. It is found on Abraxas stones, which were worn as amulets. Subsequently, its use spread beyond the Gnostics.\nThe Puritan minister Increase Mather dismissed the word as bereft of power.

{"id": "2987", "revid": "12418561", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2987", "title": "Acts of Union 1707", "text": "The Acts of Union () were two Acts of Parliament: the Union with Scotland Act 1706 passed by the Parliament of England, and the Union with England Act passed in 1707 by the Parliament of Scotland. They put into effect the terms of the Treaty of Union that had been agreed on 22 July 1706, following negotiation between commissioners representing the parliaments of the two countries. By the two Acts, the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotlandwhich at the time were separate states with separate legislatures, but with the same monarchwere, in the words of the Treaty, \"United into One Kingdom by the Name of Great Britain\".\nThe two countries had shared a monarch since the Union of the Crowns in 1603, when King James VI of Scotland inherited the English throne from his double first cousin twice removed, Queen Elizabeth I. Although described as a Union of Crowns, and King James' acknowledgement of his accession to a single Crown, England and Scotland were officially separate Kingdoms until 1707 (as opposed to the implied creation of a single unified Kingdom, exemplified by the later Kingdom of Great Britain). Prior to the Acts of Union there had been three previous attempts (in 1606, 1667, and 1689) to unite the two countries by Acts of Parliament, but it was not until the early 18th century that both political establishments came to support the idea, albeit for different reasons.\nThe Acts took effect on 1 May 1707. On this date, the Scottish Parliament and the English Parliament united to form the Parliament of Great Britain, based in the Palace of Westminster in London, the home of the English Parliament. Hence, the Acts are referred to as the Union of the Parliaments.\nPolitical background prior to 1707.\n1603\u20131660.\nPrior to 1603, England and Scotland were separate kingdoms; as Elizabeth I never married, after 1567, her heir became the Stuart king of Scotland, James VI, who was brought up as a Protestant. After her death, the two Crowns were held in personal union by James, as James I of England, and James VI of Scotland. He announced his intention to unite the two, using the royal prerogative to take the title \"King of Great Britain\", and give a British character to his court and person.\nThe 1603 Union of England and Scotland Act established a joint Commission to agree terms, but the English Parliament was concerned this would lead to the imposition of an absolutist structure similar to that of Scotland. James was forced to withdraw his proposals, and attempts to revive it in 1610 were met with hostility.\nInstead, he set about creating a unified Church of Scotland and England, as the first step towards a centralised, Unionist state. However, despite both being nominally Episcopalian in structure, the two were very different in doctrine; the Church of Scotland, or kirk, was Calvinist in doctrine, and viewed many Church of England practices as little better than Catholicism. As a result, attempts to impose religious policy by James and his son Charles I ultimately led to the 1639\u20131651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms.\nThe 1639\u20131640 Bishops' Wars confirmed the primacy of the kirk, and established a Covenanter government in Scotland. The Scots remained neutral when the First English Civil War began in 1642, before becoming concerned at the impact on Scotland of a Royalist victory. Presbyterian leaders like Argyll viewed union as a way to ensure free trade between England and Scotland, and preserve a Presbyterian kirk.\nUnder the 1643 Solemn League and Covenant, the Covenanters agreed to provide military support for the English Parliament, in return for religious union. Although the treaty referred repeatedly to 'union' between England, Scotland, and Ireland, political union had little support outside the Kirk Party. Even religious union was opposed by the Episcopalian majority in the Church of England, and Independents like Oliver Cromwell, who dominated the New Model Army.\nThe Scots and English Presbyterians were political conservatives, who increasingly viewed the Independents, and associated radical groups like the Levellers, as a bigger threat than the Royalists. Both Royalists and Presbyterians agreed monarchy was divinely ordered, but disagreed on the nature and extent of Royal authority over the church. When Charles I surrendered in 1646, they allied with their former enemies to restore him to the English throne.\nAfter defeat in the 1647\u20131648 Second English Civil War, Scotland was occupied by English troops which were withdrawn once the so-called Engagers whom Cromwell held responsible for the war had been replaced by the Kirk Party. In December 1648, Pride's Purge confirmed Cromwell's political control in England by removing Presbyterian MPs from Parliament, and executing Charles in January 1649. Seeing this as sacrilege, the Kirk Party proclaimed Charles II King of Scotland and Great Britain, and agreed to restore him to the English throne.\nDefeat in the 1649\u20131651 Third English Civil War or Anglo-Scottish War resulted in Scotland's incorporation into the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland, largely driven by Cromwell's determination to break the power of the kirk, which he held responsible for the Anglo-Scottish War. The 1652 Tender of Union was followed on 12 April 1654 by \"An Ordinance by the Protector for the Union of England and Scotland,\" creating the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland. It was ratified by the Second Protectorate Parliament on 26 June 1657, creating a single Parliament in Westminster, with 30 representatives each from Scotland and Ireland added to the existing English members.\n1660\u20131707.\nWhile integration into the Commonwealth established free trade between Scotland and England, the economic benefits were diminished by the costs of military occupation. Both Scotland and England associated union with heavy taxes and military rule; it had little popular support in either country, and was dissolved after the Restoration of Charles II in 1660.\nThe Scottish economy was badly damaged by the English Navigation Acts of 1660 and 1663 and wars with the Dutch Republic, its major export market. An Anglo-Scots Trade Commission was set up in January 1668 but the English had no interest in making concessions, as the Scots had little to offer in return. In 1669, Charles II revived talks on political union; his motives were to weaken Scotland's commercial and political links with the Dutch, still seen as an enemy and complete the work of his grandfather James I. Continued opposition meant these negotiations were abandoned by the end of 1669.\nFollowing the Glorious Revolution of 1688, a Scottish Convention met in Edinburgh in April 1689 to agree a new constitutional settlement; during which the Scottish Bishops backed a proposed union in an attempt to preserve Episcopalian control of the kirk. William and Mary were supportive of the idea but it was opposed both by the Presbyterian majority in Scotland and the English Parliament. Episcopacy in Scotland was abolished in 1690, alienating a significant part of the political class; it was this element that later formed the bedrock of opposition to Union.\nThe 1690s were a time of economic hardship in Europe as a whole and Scotland in particular, a period now known as the Seven ill years which led to strained relations with England. In 1698, the Company of Scotland Trading to Africa and the Indies received a charter to raise capital through public subscription. The Company invested in the Dari\u00e9n scheme, an ambitious plan funded almost entirely by Scottish investors to build a colony on the Isthmus of Panama for trade with East Asia. The scheme was a disaster; the losses of over \u00a3150,000 severely impacted the Scottish commercial system.\nPolitical motivations.\nThe Acts of Union should be seen within a wider European context of increasing state centralisation during the late 17th and early 18th centuries, including the monarchies of France, Sweden, Denmark and Spain. While there were exceptions, such as the Dutch Republic or the Republic of Venice, the trend was clear.\nThe dangers of the monarch using one Parliament against the other first became apparent in 1647 and 1651. It resurfaced during the 1679 to 1681 Exclusion Crisis, caused by English resistance to the Catholic James II (of England, VII of Scotland) succeeding his brother Charles. James was sent to Edinburgh in 1681 as Lord High Commissioner; in August, the Scottish Parliament passed the Succession Act, confirming the divine right of kings, the rights of the natural heir 'regardless of religion', the duty of all to swear allegiance to that king and the independence of the Scottish Crown. It then went beyond ensuring James's succession to the Scottish throne by explicitly stating the aim was to make his exclusion from the English throne impossible without '...the fatall and dreadfull consequences of a civil war.'\nThe issue reappeared during the 1688 Glorious Revolution. The English Parliament generally supported replacing James with his Protestant daughter Mary II, but resisted making her Dutch husband William III &amp; II joint ruler. They gave way only when he threatened to return to the Netherlands, and Mary refused to rule without him.\nIn Scotland, conflict over control of the kirk between Presbyterians and Episcopalians and William's position as a fellow Calvinist put him in a much stronger position. He originally insisted on retaining Episcopacy, and the Committee of the Articles, an unelected body that controlled what legislation Parliament could debate. Both would have given the Crown far greater control than in England but he withdrew his demands due to the 1689\u20131692 Jacobite Rising.\nEnglish perspective.\nThe English succession was provided for by the English Act of Settlement 1701, which ensured that the monarch of England would be a Protestant member of the House of Hanover. Until the Union of Parliaments, the Scottish throne might be inherited by a different successor after Queen Anne, who had said in her first speech to the English parliament that a Union was 'very necessary'. The Scottish Act of Security 1704 however was passed after the English parliament without consultation with Scotland, had designated Electoress Sophie of Hanover (granddaughter of James I and VI), as Anne's successor, if she died childless. The Act of Security however granted the Parliament of Scotland, the three Estates, the right to choose a successor and explicitly required a choice different from the English monarch unless the English were to grant free trade and navigation. Next the Alien Act 1705 was passed in the English parliament making Scots in England designated as 'foreign nationals' \u2013 and blocking about half of all Scottish trade by boycotting exports to England or its colonies, unless Scotland came back to negotiate a Union. To encourage a Union, 'honours, appointments, pensions and even arrears of pay and other expenses were distributed to clinch support from Scottish peers and MPs.'\nScottish perspective.\nThe Scottish economy was severely impacted by privateers during the 1688 to 1697 Nine Years' War, and the 1701 War of the Spanish Succession, with the Royal Navy focusing on protecting English ships. This compounded the economic pressure caused by the Darien scheme, and the seven ill years of the 1690s, when between 5\u201315% of the population died of starvation. The Scottish Parliament was promised financial assistance, protection for its maritime trade, and an end of economic restrictions on trade with England.\nThe votes of the Court party, influenced by Queen Anne's favourite, the Duke of Queensberry, combined with the majority of the Squadrone Volante, were sufficient to ensure passage of the treaty. Article 15 granted \u00a3398,085 and ten shillings sterling to Scotland, a sum known as The Equivalent, to offset future liability towards the English national debt, which at the time was \u00a318 million, but as Scotland had no national debt, most of the sum was used to compensate the investors in the Darien scheme, with 58.6% of the fund allocated to its shareholders and creditors.\nThe role played by bribery has long been debated; \u00a320,000 was distributed by the Earl of Glasgow, of which 60% went to James Douglas, 2nd Duke of Queensberry, the Queen's Commissioner in Parliament. Another negotiator, Argyll was given an English peerage. Robert Burns is commonly quoted in support of the argument of corruption; \"We're bought and sold for English Gold, Such a Parcel of Rogues in a Nation.\" As historian Christopher Whatley points out, this was actually a 17th-century Scots folk song; but he agrees money was paid, though suggests the economic benefits were supported by most Scots MPs, with the promises made for benefits to peers and MPs, even if it was reluctantly. Professor Sir Tom Devine, agreed that promises of 'favours, sinecures, pensions, offices and straightforward cash bribes became indispensable to secure government majorities'. As for representation going forwards, Scotland was, in the new united parliament only to get 45 MPs, one more than Cornwall, and only 16 (unelected) peers places in the House of Lords.\nSir George Lockhart of Carnwath, the only Scottish negotiator to oppose Union, noted \"the whole nation appears against (it)\". Another negotiator, Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, who was an ardent Unionist, observed it was \"contrary to the inclinations of at least three-fourths of the Kingdom\". As the seat of the Scottish Parliament, demonstrators in Edinburgh feared the impact of its loss on the local economy. Elsewhere, there was widespread concern about the independence of the kirk, and possible tax rises.\nAs the Treaty passed through the Scottish Parliament, opposition was voiced by petitions from shires, burghs, presbyteries and parishes. The Convention of Royal Burghs claimed 'we are not against an honourable and safe union with England', but 'the condition of the people of Scotland, (cannot be) improved without a Scots Parliament'. Not one petition in favour of Union was received by Parliament. On the day the treaty was signed, the carilloner in St Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh, rang the bells in the tune \"Why should I be so sad on my wedding day?\" Threats of widespread civil unrest resulted in Parliament imposing martial law.\nTreaty and passage of the 1707 Acts.\nDeeper political integration had been a key policy of Queen Anne from the time she acceded to the throne in 1702. Under the aegis of the Queen and her ministers in both kingdoms, the parliaments of England and Scotland agreed to participate in fresh negotiations for a union treaty in 1705.\nBoth countries appointed 31 commissioners to conduct the negotiations. Most of the Scottish commissioners favoured union, and about half were government ministers and other officials. At the head of the list was Queensberry, and the Lord Chancellor of Scotland, the Earl of Seafield. The English commissioners included the Lord High Treasurer, the Earl of Godolphin, the Lord Keeper, Baron Cowper, and a large number of Whigs who supported union. Tories were not in favour of union and only one was represented among the commissioners.\nNegotiations between the English and Scottish commissioners took place between 16 April and 22 July 1706 at the Cockpit in London. Each side had its own particular concerns. Within a few days, and with only one face to face meeting of all 62 commissioners, England had gained a guarantee that the Hanoverian dynasty would succeed Queen Anne to the Scottish crown, and Scotland received a guarantee of access to colonial markets, in the hope that they would be placed on an equal footing in terms of trade.\nAfter negotiations ended in July 1706, the acts had to be ratified by both Parliaments. In Scotland, about 100 of the 227 members of the Parliament of Scotland were supportive of the Court Party. For extra votes the pro-court side could rely on about 25 members of the Squadrone Volante, led by the Marquess of Montrose and the Duke of Roxburghe. Opponents of the court were generally known as the Country party, and included various factions and individuals such as the Duke of Hamilton, Lord Belhaven and Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun, who spoke forcefully and passionately against the union, when the Scottish Parliament began its debate on the act in on 3 October 1706, but the deal had already been done. The Court party enjoyed significant funding from England and the Treasury and included many who had accumulated debts following the Darien Disaster.\nIn Scotland, the Duke of Queensberry was largely responsible for the successful passage of the Union act by the Parliament of Scotland. In Scotland, he also received much criticism from local residents, but in England he was cheered for his action. He had personally received around half of the funding awarded by the Westminster Treasury for himself. In April 1707, he travelled to London to attend celebrations at the royal court, and was greeted by groups of noblemen and gentry lined along the road. From Barnet, the route was lined with crowds of cheering people, and once he reached London a huge crowd had formed. On 17 April, the Duke was gratefully received by the Queen at Kensington Palace.\nProvisions.\nThe Treaty of Union, agreed between representatives of the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland in 1706, consisted of 25 articles, 15 of which were economic in nature. In Scotland, each article was voted on separately and several clauses in articles were delegated to specialised subcommittees. Article 1 of the treaty was based on the political principle of an incorporating union and this was secured by a majority of 116 votes to 83 on 4 November 1706. To minimise the opposition of the Church of Scotland, an Act was also passed to secure the Presbyterian establishment of the Church, after which the Church stopped its open opposition, although hostility remained at lower levels of the clergy. The treaty as a whole was finally ratified on 16 January 1707 by a majority of 110 votes to 69.\nThe two Acts incorporated provisions for Scotland to send representative peers from the Peerage of Scotland to sit in the House of Lords. It guaranteed that the Church of Scotland would remain the established church in Scotland, that the Court of Session would \"remain in all time coming within Scotland\", and that Scots law would \"remain in the same force as before\". Other provisions included the restatement of the Act of Settlement 1701 and the ban on Roman Catholics from taking the throne. It also created a customs union and monetary union.\nThe Act provided that any \"laws and statutes\" that were \"contrary to or inconsistent with the terms\" of the Act would \"cease and become void\".\nRelated Acts.\nThe Scottish Parliament also passed the Protestant Religion and Presbyterian Church Act 1707 guaranteeing the status of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. The English Parliament passed a similar Act, 6 Anne c.8.\nSoon after the Union, the Act 6 Anne c.40later named the Union with Scotland (Amendment) Act 1707united the English and Scottish Privy Councils and decentralised Scottish administration by appointing justices of the peace in each shire to carry out administration. In effect it took the day-to-day government of Scotland out of the hands of politicians and into those of the College of Justice.\nOn 18 December 1707 the Act for better Securing the Duties of East India Goods was passed which extended the monopoly of the East India Company to Scotland.\nIn the year following the Union, the Treason Act 1708 abolished the Scottish law of and extended the corresponding English law across Great Britain.\nEvaluations.\nScotland benefited, says historian G.N. Clark, gaining \"freedom of trade with England and the colonies\" as well as \"a great expansion of markets\". The agreement guaranteed the permanent status of the Presbyterian church in Scotland, and the separate system of laws and courts in Scotland. Clark argued that in exchange for the financial benefits and bribes that England bestowed, what it gained was\nof inestimable value. Scotland accepted the Hanoverian succession and gave up her power of threatening England's military security and complicating her commercial relations ... The sweeping successes of the eighteenth-century wars owed much to the new unity of the two nations.\nBy the time Samuel Johnson and James Boswell made their tour in 1773, recorded in \"A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland\", Johnson noted that Scotland was \"a nation of which the commerce is hourly extending, and the wealth increasing\" and in particular that Glasgow had become one of the greatest cities of Britain.\n300th anniversary.\nA commemorative two-pound coin was issued to mark the tercentennial\u2014300th anniversary\u2014of the Union, which occurred two days before the Scottish Parliament general election on 3 May 2007.\nThe Scottish Government held a number of commemorative events through the year including an education project led by the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland, an exhibition of Union-related objects and documents at the National Museums of Scotland and an exhibition of portraits of people associated with the Union at the National Galleries of Scotland."}

For much of its history, from the early 18th century until its abolition, the role of the Lord High Admiral was almost invariably put \"in commission\" and exercised by the Lords Commissioner of the Admiralty, who sat on the governing Board of Admiralty, rather than by a single person. The Admiralty was replaced by the Admiralty Board in 1964, as part of the reforms that created the Ministry of Defence and its Navy Department (later Navy Command).\nBefore the Acts of Union 1707, the Office of the Admiralty and Marine Affairs administered the Royal Navy of the Kingdom of England, which merged with the Royal Scots Navy and the absorbed the responsibilities of the Lord High Admiral of the Kingdom of Scotland with the unification of the Kingdom of Great Britain. The Admiralty was among the most important departments of the British Government, because of the Royal Navy's role in the expansion and maintenance of the British Empire in the 17th century, in the 18th century, and subsequently.\nThe modern Admiralty Board, to which the functions of the Admiralty were transferred in 1964, is a committee of the tri-service Defence Council of the United Kingdom. This Admiralty Board meets only twice a year, and the day-to-day running of the Royal Navy is controlled by a Navy Board (not to be confused with the historic Navy Board). It is common for the various authorities now in charge of the Royal Navy to be referred to as simply 'The Admiralty'.\nThe title of Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom was vested in the monarch from 1964 to 2011. The title was awarded to Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh by Queen Elizabeth II on his 90th birthday. There also continues to be a Vice-Admiral of the United Kingdom and a Rear-Admiral of the United Kingdom, both of which are honorary offices.\nHistory.\nThe office of Admiral of England (later Lord Admiral, and later Lord High Admiral) was created around 1400; there had previously been Admirals of the northern and western seas. King Henry VIII established the Council of the Marine\u2014later to become the Navy Board\u2014in 1546, to oversee administrative affairs of the naval service. Operational control of the Royal Navy remained the responsibility of the Lord High Admiral, who was one of the nine Great Officers of State. This management approach would continue in force in the Royal Navy until 1832.\nKing Charles I put the office of Lord High Admiral into commission in 1628, and control of the Royal Navy passed to a committee in the form of the Board of Admiralty. The office of Lord High Admiral passed a number of times in and out of commission until 1709, after which the office was almost permanently in commission (the last Lord High Admiral being the future King William IV in the early 19th century).\nIn this organization a dual system operated the Lord High Admiral (from 1546) then Commissioners of the Admiralty (from 1628) exercised the function of general control (military administration) of the Navy and they were usually responsible for the conduct of any war, while the actual supply lines, support and services were managed by four principal officers, namely, the Treasurer, Comptroller, Surveyor and Clerk of the Acts, responsible individually for finance, supervision of accounts, Shipbuilding and maintenance of ships, and record of business. These principal officers came to be known as the Navy Board responsible for 'civil administration' of the navy, from 1546 to 1832.\nThis structure of administering the navy lasted for 285 years, however, the supply system was often inefficient and corrupt its deficiencies were due as much to its limitations of the times they operated in. The various functions within the Admiralty were not coordinated effectively and lacked inter-dependency with each other, with the result that in 1832, Sir James Graham abolished the Navy Board and merged its functions within those of the Board of Admiralty. At the time this had distinct advantages; however, it failed to retain the principle of distinctions between the Admiralty and supply, and a lot of bureaucracy followed with the merger.\nIn 1860 saw big growth in the development of technical crafts, the expansion of more admiralty branches that really began with age of steam that would have an enormous influence on the navy and naval thought. Between 1860 and 1908, there was no real study of strategy and of staff work conducted within the naval service; it was practically ignored. All the Navy's talent flowed to the great technical universities. This school of thought for the next 50 years was exclusively technically based. The first serious attempt to introduce a sole management body to administer the naval service manifested itself in the creation of the Admiralty Navy War Council in 1909. It was believed by officials within the Admiralty at this time that the running of war was quite a simple matter for any flag officer who required no formal training. However, this mentality would be severely questioned with the advent of the Agadir crisis, when the Admiralty's war plans were heavily criticized.\nFollowing this, a new advisory body called the Admiralty War Staff was then instituted in 1912, headed by the Chief of the War Staff who was responsible for administering three new sub-divisions responsible for operations, intelligence and mobilisation. The new War Staff had hardly found its feet and it continually struggled with the opposition to its existence by senior officers they were categorically opposed to a staff. The deficiencies of the system within this department of state could be seen in the conduct of the Dardanelles campaign. There were no mechanisms in place to answer the big strategic questions. A Trade Division was created in 1914. Sir John Jellicoe came to the Admiralty in 1916. He re-organized the war staff as following: Chief of War Staff, Operations, Intelligence, Signal Section, Mobilisation, Trade.\nIt was not until 1917 that the admiralty department was again properly reorganized and began to function as a professional military staff. In May 1917, the term \"Admiralty War Staff\" was renamed and that department and its functional role were superseded by a new \"Admiralty Naval Staff\"; in addition, the newly created office of Chief of the Naval Staff was merged in the office of the First Sea Lord. Also appointed was a new post, that of Deputy Chief of the Naval Staff, and an Assistant Chief of the Naval Staff; all were given seats on the Board of Admiralty. This for the first time gave the naval staff direct representation on the board; the presence of three senior naval senior members on the board ensured the necessary authority to carry through any operation of war. The Deputy Chief of Naval Staff would direct all operations and movements of the fleet, while the Assistant Chief of Naval Staff would be responsible for mercantile movements and anti-submarine operations.\nThe office of Controller would be re-established to deal with all questions relating to supply; on 6 September 1917, a Deputy First Sea Lord, was added to the Board who would administer operations abroad and deal with questions of foreign policy. In October 1917, the development of the staff was carried one step further by the creation of two sub-committees of the Board\u2014the Operations Committee and the Maintenance Committee. The First Lord of the Admiralty was chairman of both committees, and the Operations Committee consisted of the First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff, the Deputy First Sea Lord, Assistant Chief of Naval Staff, and Fifth Sea Lord. The Maintenance Committee consisted of the Deputy First Sea Lord (representing the operations committee), Second Sea Lord (personnel), Third Sea Lord (materiel), Fourth Sea Lord (transport and stores), Civil Lord, Controller and Financial Secretary.\nFull operational control of the Royal Navy was finally handed over to the Chief of Naval Staff (CNS) by an order in Council, effective October 1917, under which he became responsible for the issuing of orders affecting all war operations directly to the fleet. It also empowered the CNS to issue orders in their own name, as opposed to them previously being issued by the Permanent Secretary of the Admiralty in the name of the Board. In 1964, the Admiralty\u2014along with the War Office and the Air Ministry\u2014were abolished as separate departments of state, and placed under one single new Ministry of Defence. Within the expanded Ministry of Defence are the new Admiralty Board which has a separate Navy Board responsible for the day-to-day running of the Royal Navy, the Army Board and the Air Force Board, each headed by the Secretary of State for Defence. This structure remained in place until the department was abolished in 1964; the operational control and this system still remains in place with the Royal Navy today. For the organisational structure of the admiralty department and how it developed through the centuries see the following articles below.\nOrganizational structure.\nIn the 20th century the structure of the Admiralty Headquarters was predominantly organized into four parts:\nBoard of Admiralty\nWhen the office of Lord High Admiral was in commission, as it was for most of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, until it reverted to the Crown, it was exercised by a Board of Admiralty, officially known as the \"Commissioners for Exercising the Office of Lord High Admiral of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, &amp;c.\" (alternatively of England, Great Britain or the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland depending on the period). The Board of Admiralty consisted of a number of Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty. The Lords Commissioners were always a mixture of admirals, known as Naval Lords or Sea Lords and Civil Lords, normally politicians. The quorum of the Board was two commissioners and a secretary. The president of the Board was known as the First Lord of the Admiralty, who was a member of the Cabinet. After 1806, the First Lord of the Admiralty was always a civilian, while the professional head of the navy came to be (and is still today) known as the First Sea Lord.\nLords Commissioners of the Admiralty (1628\u20131964)\nThe Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty were the members of The Board of Admiralty, which exercised the office of Lord High Admiral when it was not vested in a single person. The commissioners were a mixture of politicians without naval experience and professional naval officers, the proportion of naval officers generally increasing over time.\nKey Officials\nFirst Lord of the Admiralty\nThe First Lord of the Admiralty or formally the Office of the First Lord of the Admiralty was the British government's senior civilian adviser on all naval affairs and the minister responsible for the direction and control of the Admiralty and Marine Affairs Office later the Department of Admiralty.(+) His office was supported by the Naval Secretariat.\nFirst Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff\nThe First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff was the Chief Naval Adviser on the Board of Admiralty to the First Lord and superintended the offices of the sea lords and the admiralty naval staff.\nNavy Board\nThe Navy Board was an independent board from 1546 until 1628 when it became subordinate to, yet autonomous of the Board of Admiralty until 1832. Its principal commissioners of the Navy advised the board in relation to civil administration of the naval affairs. The Navy Board was based at the Navy Office.\nBoard of Admiralty civilian members responsible other important civil functions\nAdmiralty Naval Staff\nIt evolved from *Admiralty Navy War Council, (1909\u20131912) which in turn became the Admiralty War Staff, (1912\u20131917) before finally becoming the Admiralty Naval Staff in 1917. It was the former senior command, operational planning, policy and strategy department within the British Admiralty. It was established in 1917 and existed until 1964 when the department of the Admiralty was abolished, and the staff departments function continued within the Navy Department of the Ministry of Defence until 1971 when its functions became part of the new Naval Staff, Navy Department of the Ministry of Defence.\nOffices of the Naval Staff\nAdmiralty Departments\nThe Admiralty Departments were distinct and component parts of the Department of Admiralty that were superintended by the various offices of the Sea Lords responsible for them; they were primarily administrative, research, scientific and logistical support organisations. The departments role was to provide the men, ships, aircraft and supplies to carry out the approved policy of the Board of Admiralty and conveyed to them during 20th century by the Admiralty Naval Staff.\nOffices of the Sea Lords\nDepartment of the Permanent Secretary\nThe Secretary's Department consisted of members of the civil service it was directed and controlled by a senior civil servant Permanent Secretary to the Board of Admiralty he was not a Lord Commissioner of the Admiralty, he functioned as a member of the board, and attended all of its meetings.\nAdmiralty Buildings.\nThe Admiralty complex lies between Whitehall, Horse Guards Parade and The Mall and includes five inter-connected buildings. Since the Admiralty no longer exists as a department, these buildings are now used by separate government departments:\nThe Admiralty.\nThe oldest building was long known simply as \"The Admiralty\"; it is now known officially as the Ripley Building, a three-storey U-shaped brick building designed by Thomas Ripley and completed in 1726. Alexander Pope implied that the architecture is rather dull, lacking either the vigour of the Baroque style, fading from fashion at the time, or the austere grandeur of the Palladian style just coming into vogue. It is mainly notable for being perhaps the first purpose-built office building in Great Britain. It contained the Admiralty board room, which is still used by the Admiralty, other state rooms, offices and apartments for the Lords of the Admiralty. Robert Adam designed the screen, which was added to the entrance front in 1788. The Ripley Building is currently occupied by the International Development section of the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.\nAdmiralty House.\nAdmiralty House is a moderately proportioned mansion to the south of the Ripley Building, built in the late 18th century as the residence of the First Lord of the Admiralty from 1788. It served that purpose until 1964. Winston Churchill was one of its occupants in 1911\u20131915 and 1939\u20131940. It lacks its own entrance from Whitehall and is entered through the Ripley Courtyard or Ripley Building. It is a three-storey building in yellow brick with neoclassical interiors. Its rear facade faces directly onto Horse Guards Parade. The architect was Samuel Pepys Cockerell. The ground floor comprises meeting rooms for the Cabinet Office and the upper floors are three ministerial residences.\nAdmiralty Extension.\nThis is the largest of the Admiralty Buildings. It was begun in the late 19th century and redesigned while the construction was in progress to accommodate the extra offices needed by the naval arms race with the German Empire. It is a red brick building with white stone, detailing in the Queen Anne style with French influences. It has been used by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office from the 1960s to 2016. The Department for Education planned to move into the building in September 2017 following the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's decision to leave the building and consolidate its London staff into one building on King Charles Street. A change of contractor (BAM was replaced by Willmott Dixon) delayed consolidation of the Department for Education to autumn 2018.\nAdmiralty Arch.\nAdmiralty Arch is linked to the Old Admiralty Building by a bridge and is part of the ceremonial route from Trafalgar Square to Buckingham Palace. In 2012, HM Government sold the building on a 125-year lease for \u00a360m for a proposed redevelopment into a Waldorf Astoria luxury hotel and four apartments.\nThe Admiralty Citadel.\nThis is a squat, windowless World War II fortress north west of Horse Guards Parade, now covered in ivy. See Military citadels under London for further details.\n\"Admiralty\" as a metonym for \"sea power\".\nIn some cases, the term \"admiralty\" is used in a wider sense, as meaning \"sea power\" or \"rule over the seas\", rather than in strict reference to the institution exercising such power. For example, the well-known lines from Kipling's \"Song of the Dead\":\nFurther reading.\nThe Building\nThe Office"}

Amputation has also been used as a tactic in war and acts of terrorism; it may also occur as a war injury. In some cultures and religions, minor amputations or mutilations are considered a ritual accomplishment.\nWhen done by a person, the person executing the amputation is an amputator. The amputated person is called an amputee.\nIn the US, the majority of new amputations occur due to complications of the vascular system (the blood vessels), especially from diabetes. Between 1988 and 1996, there were an average of 133,735 hospital discharges for amputation per year in the US. In 2005, just in the US, there were 1.6\u00a0million amputees. In 2013, the US has 2.1\u00a0million amputees. Approximately 185,000 amputations occur in the United States each year. In 2009, hospital costs associated with amputation totaled more than $8.3\u00a0billion. There will be an estimated 3.6\u00a0million people in the US living with limb loss by 2050. African Americans are up to four times more likely to have an amputation than European Americans.\nTypes.\nLeg.\nLower limb amputations can be divided into two broad categories: minor and major amputations. Minor amputations generally refer to the amputation of digits. Major amputations are commonly below-knee- or above-knee amputations. Common partial foot amputations include the Chopart, Lisfranc, and ray amputations.\nCommon forms of ankle disarticulations include Pyrogoff, Boyd, and Syme amputations. A less common major amputation is the Van Nes rotation, or rotationplasty, i.e. the turning around and reattachment of the foot to allow the ankle joint to take over the function of the knee.\nTypes of amputations include:\nArm.\nTypes of upper extremity amputations include:\nA variant of the trans-radial amputation is the Krukenberg procedure in which the radius and ulna are used to create a stump capable of a pincer action.\nOther.\nHemicorporectomy, or amputation at the waist, and decapitation, or amputation at the neck, are the most radical amputations.\nGenital modification and mutilation may involve amputating tissue, although not necessarily as a result of injury or disease.\nNails are typically trimmed with nail clippers, but this is not typically considered amputation.\nSelf-amputation.\nIn some rare cases when a person has become trapped in a deserted place, with no means of communication or hope of rescue, the victim has amputated his or her own limb. The most notable case of this is Aron Ralston, a hiker who amputated his own right forearm after it was pinned by a boulder in a hiking accident and he was unable to free himself for over five days.\nBody integrity identity disorder is a psychological condition in which an individual feels compelled to remove one or more of their body parts, usually a limb. In some cases, that individual may take drastic measures to remove the offending appendages, either by causing irreparable damage to the limb so that medical intervention cannot save the limb, or by causing the limb to be severed.\nCauses.\nFrostbite.\nFrostbite, also known as frostnip, happens when the individual's skin is exposed to cold weather for too long. The fluid in the pale skin solidifies, creating ice crystals, leading to swelling and severe pain. Other symptoms can include numbness, confusion, dizziness, fatigue, nausea, stiffness in the muscles or joints as well as difficulty walking. If the frostbite doesn't get treated soon, this process results in hypothermia, death or poisoning of the bloodstream.\nThis can affect the hands, feet, toes, fingers, eyes, and face. Once the frostbite shuts the eyelids, this is known as snow blindness. The only way to stop it from spreading is through skin grafts or amputation.\nAthletic performance.\nSometimes professional athletes may choose to have a non-essential digit amputated to relieve chronic pain and impaired performance. \nSurgery.\nMethod.\nThe first step is ligating the supplying artery and vein, to prevent hemorrhage (bleeding). The muscles are transected, and finally, the bone is sawed through with an oscillating saw. Sharp and rough edges of bones are filed, skin and muscle flaps are then transposed over the stump, occasionally with the insertion of elements to attach a prosthesis.\nDistal stabilisation of muscles is recommended. This allows effective muscle contraction which reduces atrophy, allows functional use of the stump and maintains soft tissue coverage of the remnant bone. The preferred stabilisation technique is myodesis where the muscle is attached to the bone or its periosteum. In joint disarticulation amputations tenodesis may be used where the muscle tendon is attached to the bone. Muscles should be attached under similar tension to normal physiological conditions.\nAn experimental technique known as the \"Ewing amputation\" aims to improve post-amputation proprioception.\nIn 1920,\u00a0 Professor Janos Ertl Sr., MD, of Hungary, developed the Ertl procedure in order to return a high number of amputees to the work force. The Ertl technique, an osteomyoplastic procedure for transtibial amputation, can be used to create a highly functional residual limb. Creation of a tibiofibular bone bridge provides a stable, broad tibiofibular articulation that may be capable of some distal weight bearing. Several different modified techniques and fibular bridge fixation methods have been used; however, no current evidence exists regarding comparison of the different techniques.\nPost-operative management.\nA 2019 Cochrane systematic review aimed to determine whether rigid dressings were more effective than soft dressings in helping wounds heal following transtibial (below the knee) amputations. Due to the limited and very low certainty evidence available, the authors concluded that it was uncertain what the benefits and harms were for each dressing type. They recommended that clinicians consider the pros and cons of each dressing type on a case-by-case basis e.g. rigid dressings may potentially benefit patients who have a high risk of falls and soft dressings may potentially benefit patients who have poor skin integrity.\nA 2017 review found that the use of rigid removable dressings (RRD's) in trans-tibial amputations, rather than soft bandaging, improved healing time, reduced edema, prevented knee flexion contractures and reduced complications, including further amputation, from external trauma such as falls onto the stump.\nPost-operative management, in addition to wound healing, should consider maintenance of limb strength, joint range, edema management, preservation of the intact limb (if applicable) and stump desensitisation.\nTrauma.\nTraumatic amputation is the partial or total avulsion of a part of a body during a serious accident, like traffic, labor, or combat.\nTraumatic amputation of a human limb, either partial or total, creates the immediate danger of death from blood loss.\nOrthopedic surgeons often assess the severity of different injuries using the Mangled Extremity Severity Score. Given different clinical and situational factors, they can predict the likelihood of amputation. This is especially useful for emergency physicians to quickly evaluate patients and decide on consultations.\nCauses.\nTraumatic amputation is uncommon in humans (1 per 20,804 population per year). Loss of limb usually happens immediately during the accident, but sometimes a few days later after medical complications. Statistically, the most common causes of traumatic amputations are:\nTreatment.\nThe development of the science of microsurgery over the last 40 years has provided several treatment options for a traumatic amputation, depending on the patient's specific trauma and clinical situation:\nPrevention.\nMethods in preventing amputation, limb-sparing techniques, depend on the problems that might cause amputations to be necessary. Chronic infections, often caused by diabetes or decubitus ulcers in bedridden patients, are common causes of infections that lead to gangrene, which would then necessitate amputation.\nThere are two key challenges: first, many patients have impaired circulation in their extremities, and second, they have difficulty curing infections in limbs with poor vasculation (blood circulation).\nCrush injuries where there is extensive tissue damage and poor circulation also benefit from hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT). The high level of oxygenation and revascularization speed up recovery times and prevent infections.\nA study found that the patented method called Circulator Boot achieved significant results in prevention of amputation in patients with diabetes and arteriosclerosis. Another study found it also effective for healing limb ulcers caused by peripheral vascular disease. The boot checks the heart rhythm and compresses the limb between heartbeats; the compression helps cure the wounds in the walls of veins and arteries, and helps to push the blood back to the heart.\nFor victims of trauma, advances in microsurgery in the 1970s have made replantations of severed body parts possible.\nThe establishment of laws, rules, and guidelines, and employment of modern equipment help protect people from traumatic amputations.\nPrognosis.\nThe individual may experience psychological trauma and emotional discomfort. The stump will remain an area of reduced mechanical stability. Limb loss can present significant or even drastic practical limitations.\nA large proportion of amputees (50\u201380%) experience the phenomenon of phantom limbs; they feel body parts that are no longer there. These limbs can itch, ache, burn, feel tense, dry or wet, locked in or trapped or they can feel as if they are moving. Some scientists believe it has to do with a kind of neural map that the brain has of the body, which sends information to the rest of the brain about limbs regardless of their existence. Phantom sensations and phantom pain may also occur after the removal of body parts other than the limbs, e.g. after amputation of the breast, extraction of a tooth (phantom tooth pain) or removal of an eye (phantom eye syndrome).\nA similar phenomenon is unexplained sensation in a body part unrelated to the amputated limb. It has been hypothesized that the portion of the brain responsible for processing stimulation from amputated limbs, being deprived of input, expands into the surrounding brain, (\"Phantoms in the Brain\": V.S. Ramachandran and Sandra Blakeslee) such that an individual who has had an arm amputated will experience unexplained pressure or movement on his face or head.\nIn many cases, the phantom limb aids in adaptation to a prosthesis, as it permits the person to experience proprioception of the prosthetic limb. To support improved resistance or usability, comfort or healing, some type of stump socks may be worn instead of or as part of wearing a prosthesis.\nAnother side effect can be heterotopic ossification, especially when a bone injury is combined with a head injury. The brain signals the bone to grow instead of scar tissue to form, and nodules and other growth can interfere with prosthetics and sometimes require further operations. This type of injury has been especially common among soldiers wounded by improvised explosive devices in the Iraq War.\nDue to technologic advances in prosthetics, many amputees live active lives with little restriction. Organizations such as the Challenged Athletes Foundation have been developed to give amputees the opportunity to be involved in athletics and adaptive sports such as Amputee Soccer.\nNearly half of the individuals who have an amputation due to vascular disease will die within 5 years, usually secondary to the extensive co-morbidities rather than due to direct consequences of amputation. This is higher than the five year mortality rates for breast cancer, colon cancer, and prostate cancer. Of persons with diabetes who have a lower extremity amputation, up to 55% will require amputation of the second leg within two to three years.\nEtymology.\nThe word amputation is derived from the Latin \"amputare\", \"to cut away\", from \"ambi-\" (\"about\", \"around\") and \"putare\" (\"to prune\"). The English word \u201cPoes\u201d was first applied to surgery in the 17th century, possibly first in Peter Lowe's \"A discourse of the Whole Art of Chirurgerie\" (published in either 1597 or 1612); his work was derived from 16th-century French texts and early English writers also used the words \"extirpation\" (16th-century French texts tended to use \"extirper\"), \"disarticulation\", and \"dismemberment\" (from the Old French \"desmembrer\" and a more common term before the 17th century for limb loss or removal), or simply \"cutting\", but by the end of the 17th century \"amputation\" had come to dominate as the accepted medical term."}

{"id": "2994", "revid": "4754841", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2994", "title": "Anemometer", "text": "An anemometer is a device used for measuring wind speed and direction. It is also a common weather station instrument. The term is derived from the Greek word \"anemos\", which means wind, and is used to describe any wind speed instrument used in meteorology. The first known description of an anemometer was given by Leon Battista Alberti in 1450.\nHistory.\nThe anemometer has changed little since its development in the 15th century. Leon Battista Alberti (1404\u20131472) is said to have invented the first mechanical anemometer around 1450. In following centuries, numerous others, including Robert Hooke\n(1635\u20131703), developed their own versions, with some being mistakenly credited as the inventor. In 1846, John Thomas Romney Robinson (1792\u20131882) improved upon the design by using four hemispherical cups and mechanical wheels. In 1926, Canadian meteorologist John Patterson (January 3, 1872 \u2013 February 22, 1956) developed a three-cup anemometer, which was improved by Brevoort and Joiner in 1935. In 1991, Derek Weston added the ability to measure wind direction. In 1994, Andreas Pflitsch developed the sonic anemometer.\nVelocity anemometers.\nCup anemometers.\nA simple type of anemometer was invented in 1845 by Rev Dr John Thomas Romney Robinson, of Armagh Observatory. It consisted of four hemispherical cups mounted on horizontal arms, which were mounted on a vertical shaft. The air flow past the cups in any horizontal direction turned the shaft at a rate that was roughly proportional to the wind speed. Therefore, counting the turns of the shaft over a set time interval produced a value proportional to the average wind speed for a wide range of speeds. It is also called a rotational anemometer.\nOn an anemometer with four cups, it is easy to see that since the cups are arranged symmetrically on the end of the arms, the wind always has the hollow of one cup presented to it and is blowing on the back of the cup on the opposite end of the cross. Since a hollow hemisphere has a drag coefficient of .38 on the spherical side and 1.42 on the hollow side, more force is generated on the cup that is presenting its hollow side to the wind. Because of this asymmetrical force, torque is generated on the axis of the anemometer, causing it to spin.\nTheoretically, the speed of rotation of the anemometer should be proportional to the wind speed because the force produced on an object is proportional to the speed of the fluid flowing past it. However, in practice other factors influence the rotational speed, including turbulence produced by the apparatus, increasing drag in opposition to the torque that is produced by the cups and support arms, and friction of the mount point. When Robinson first designed his anemometer, he asserted that the cups moved one-third of the speed of the wind, unaffected by the cup size or arm length. This was apparently confirmed by some early independent experiments, but it was incorrect. Instead, the ratio of the speed of the wind and that of the cups, the \"anemometer factor\", depends on the dimensions of the cups and arms, and may have a value between two and a little over three. Every previous experiment involving an anemometer had to be repeated after the error was discovered.\nThe three-cup anemometer developed by the Canadian John Patterson in 1926 and subsequent cup improvements by Brevoort &amp; Joiner of the United States in 1935 led to a cupwheel design with a nearly linear response and had an error of less than 3% up to . Patterson found that each cup produced maximum torque when it was at 45\u00b0 to the wind flow. The three-cup anemometer also had a more constant torque and responded more quickly to gusts than the four-cup anemometer.\nThe three-cup anemometer was further modified by the Australian Dr. Derek Weston in 1991 to measure both wind direction and wind speed. Weston added a tag to one cup, which causes the cupwheel speed to increase and decrease as the tag moves alternately with and against the wind. Wind direction is calculated from these cyclical changes in cupwheel speed, while wind speed is determined from the average cupwheel speed.\nThree-cup anemometers are currently used as the industry standard for wind resource assessment studies &amp; practice.\nVane anemometers.\nOne of the other forms of mechanical velocity anemometer is the \"vane anemometer\". It may be described as a windmill or a propeller anemometer. Unlike the Robinson anemometer, whose axis of rotation is vertical, the vane anemometer must have its axis parallel to the direction of the wind and therefore horizontal. Furthermore, since the wind varies in direction and the axis has to follow its changes, a wind vane or some other contrivance to fulfill the same purpose must be employed.\nA \"vane anemometer\" thus combines a propeller and a tail on the same axis to obtain accurate and precise wind speed and direction measurements from the same instrument. The speed of the fan is measured by a rev counter and converted to a windspeed by an electronic chip. Hence, volumetric flow rate may be calculated if the cross-sectional area is known.\nIn cases where the direction of the air motion is always the same, as in ventilating shafts of mines and buildings, wind vanes known as air meters are employed, and give satisfactory results.\nHot-wire anemometers.\nHot wire anemometers use a fine wire (on the order of several micrometres) electrically heated to some temperature above the ambient. Air flowing past the wire cools the wire. As the electrical resistance of most metals is dependent upon the temperature of the metal (tungsten is a popular choice for hot-wires), a relationship can be obtained between the resistance of the wire and the speed of the air. In most cases, they cannot be used to measure the direction of the airflow, unless coupled with a wind vane.\nSeveral ways of implementing this exist, and hot-wire devices can be further classified as CCA (constant current anemometer), CVA (constant voltage anemometer) and CTA (constant-temperature anemometer). The voltage output from these anemometers is thus the result of some sort of circuit within the device trying to maintain the specific variable (current, voltage or temperature) constant, following Ohm's law.\nAdditionally, PWM (pulse-width modulation) anemometers are also used, wherein the velocity is inferred by the time length of a repeating pulse of current that brings the wire up to a specified resistance and then stops until a threshold \"floor\" is reached, at which time the pulse is sent again.\nHot-wire anemometers, while extremely delicate, have extremely high frequency-response and fine spatial resolution compared to other measurement methods, and as such are almost universally employed for the detailed study of turbulent flows, or any flow in which rapid velocity fluctuations are of interest.\nAn industrial version of the fine-wire anemometer is the thermal flow meter, which follows the same concept, but uses two pins or strings to monitor the variation in temperature. The strings contain fine wires, but encasing the wires makes them much more durable and capable of accurately measuring air, gas, and emissions flow in pipes, ducts, and stacks. Industrial applications often contain dirt that will damage the classic hot-wire anemometer.\nLaser Doppler anemometers.\nIn laser Doppler velocimetry, laser Doppler anemometers use a beam of light from a laser that is divided into two beams, with one propagated out of the anemometer. Particulates (or deliberately introduced seed material) flowing along with air molecules near where the beam exits reflect, or backscatter, the light back into a detector, where it is measured relative to the original laser beam. When the particles are in great motion, they produce a Doppler shift for measuring wind speed in the laser light, which is used to calculate the speed of the particles, and therefore the air around the anemometer.\nUltrasonic anemometers.\nUltrasonic anemometers, first developed in the 1950s, use ultrasonic sound waves to measure wind velocity. They measure wind speed based on the time of flight of sonic pulses between pairs of transducers. Measurements from pairs of transducers can be combined to yield a measurement of velocity in 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional flow. The spatial resolution is given by the path length between transducers, which is typically 10 to 20 cm. Ultrasonic anemometers can take measurements with very fine temporal resolution, 20 Hz or better, which makes them well suited for turbulence measurements. The lack of moving parts makes them appropriate for long-term use in exposed automated weather stations and weather buoys where the accuracy and reliability of traditional cup-and-vane anemometers are adversely affected by salty air or dust. Their main disadvantage is the distortion of the air flow by the structure supporting the transducers, which requires a correction based upon wind tunnel measurements to minimize the effect. An international standard for this process, ISO 16622 \"Meteorology\u2014Ultrasonic anemometers/thermometers\u2014Acceptance test methods for mean wind measurements\" is in general circulation. Another disadvantage is lower accuracy due to precipitation, where rain drops may vary the speed of sound.\nSince the speed of sound varies with temperature, and is virtually stable with pressure change, ultrasonic anemometers are also used as thermometers.\nTwo-dimensional (wind speed and wind direction) sonic anemometers are used in applications such as weather stations, ship navigation, aviation, weather buoys and wind turbines. Monitoring wind turbines usually requires a refresh rate of wind speed measurements of 3\u00a0Hz, easily achieved by sonic anemometers. Three-dimensional sonic anemometers are widely used to measure gas emissions and ecosystem fluxes using the eddy covariance method when used with fast-response infrared gas analyzers or laser-based analyzers.\nTwo-dimensional wind sensors are of two types:\nAcoustic resonance anemometers.\nAcoustic resonance anemometers are a more recent variant of sonic anemometer. The technology was invented by Savvas Kapartis and patented in 1999. Whereas conventional sonic anemometers rely on time of flight measurement, acoustic resonance sensors use resonating acoustic (ultrasonic) waves within a small purpose-built cavity in order to perform their measurement.\nBuilt into the cavity is an array of ultrasonic transducers, which are used to create the separate standing-wave patterns at ultrasonic frequencies. As wind passes through the cavity, a change in the wave's property occurs (phase shift). By measuring the amount of phase shift in the received signals by each transducer, and then by mathematically processing the data, the sensor is able to provide an accurate horizontal measurement of wind speed and direction.\nAcoustic resonance technology enables measurement within a small cavity, the sensors therefore tend to be typically smaller in size than other ultrasonic sensors. The small size of acoustic resonance anemometers makes them physically strong and easy to heat and therefore resistant to icing. This combination of features means that they achieve high levels of data availability and are well suited to wind turbine control and to other uses that require small robust sensors such as battlefield meteorology. One issue with this sensor type is measurement accuracy when compared to a calibrated mechanical sensor. For many end uses, this weakness is compensated for by the sensor's longevity and the fact that it does not require re-calibrating once installed.\nPing-pong ball anemometers.\nA common anemometer for basic use is constructed from a ping-pong ball attached to a string. When the wind blows horizontally, it presses on and moves the ball; because ping-pong balls are very lightweight, they move easily in light winds. Measuring the angle between the string-ball apparatus and the vertical gives an estimate of the wind speed.\nThis type of anemometer is mostly used for middle-school level instruction, which most students make on their own, but a similar device was also flown on Phoenix Mars Lander.\nPressure anemometers.\nThe first designs of anemometers that measure the pressure were divided into plate and tube classes.\nPlate anemometers.\nThese are the first modern anemometers. They consist of a flat plate suspended from the top so that the wind deflects the plate. In 1450, the Italian art architect Leon Battista Alberti invented the first mechanical anemometer; in 1664 it was re-invented by Robert Hooke (who is often mistakenly considered the inventor of the first anemometer). Later versions of this form consisted of a flat plate, either square or circular, which is kept normal to the wind by a wind vane. The pressure of the wind on its face is balanced by a spring. The compression of the spring determines the actual force which the wind is exerting on the plate, and this is either read off on a suitable gauge, or on a recorder. Instruments of this kind do not respond to light winds, are inaccurate for high wind readings, and are slow at responding to variable winds. Plate anemometers have been used to trigger high wind alarms on bridges.\nTube anemometers.\nJames Lind's anemometer of 1775 consisted of a glass U tube containing a liquid manometer (pressure gauge), with one end bent in a horizontal direction to face the wind and the other vertical end remains parallel to the wind flow. Though the Lind was not the first it was the most practical and best known anemometer of this type. If the wind blows into the mouth of a tube it causes an increase of pressure on one side of the manometer. The wind over the open end of a vertical tube causes little change in pressure on the other side of the manometer. The resulting elevation difference in the two legs of the U tube is an indication of the wind speed. However, an accurate measurement requires that the wind speed be directly into the open end of the tube; small departures from the true direction of the wind causes large variations in the reading.\nThe successful metal pressure tube anemometer of William Henry Dines in 1892 utilized the same pressure difference between the open mouth of a straight tube facing the wind and a ring of small holes in a vertical tube which is closed at the upper end. Both are mounted at the same height. The pressure differences on which the action depends are very small, and special means are required to register them. The recorder consists of a float in a sealed chamber partially filled with water. The pipe from the straight tube is connected to the top of the sealed chamber and the pipe from the small tubes is directed into the bottom inside the float. Since the pressure difference determines the vertical position of the float this is a measure of the wind speed.\nThe great advantage of the tube anemometer lies in the fact that the exposed part can be mounted on a high pole, and requires no oiling or attention for years; and the registering part can be placed in any convenient position. Two connecting tubes are required. It might appear at first sight as though one connection would serve, but the differences in pressure on which these instruments depend are so minute, that the pressure of the air in the room where the recording part is placed has to be considered. Thus if the instrument depends on the pressure or suction effect alone, and this pressure or suction is measured against the air pressure in an ordinary room, in which the doors and windows are carefully closed and a newspaper is then burnt up the chimney, an effect may be produced equal to a wind of 10\u00a0mi/h (16\u00a0km/h); and the opening of a window in rough weather, or the opening of a door, may entirely alter the registration.\nWhile the Dines anemometer had an error of only 1% at , it did not respond very well to low winds due to the poor response of the flat plate vane required to turn the head into the wind. In 1918 an aerodynamic vane with eight times the torque of the flat plate overcame this problem.\nPitot tube static anemometers.\nModern tube anemometers use the same principle as in the Dines anemometer but using a different design. The implementation uses a pitot-static tube which is a pitot tube with two ports, pitot and static, that is normally used in measuring the airspeed of aircraft. The pitot port measures the dynamic pressure of the open mouth of a tube with pointed head facing wind, and the static port measures the static pressure from small holes along the side on that tube. The pitot tube is connected to a tail so that it always makes the tube's head to face the wind. Additionally, the tube is heated to prevent rime ice formation on the tube. There are two lines from the tube down to the devices to measure the difference in pressure of the two lines. The measurement devices can be manometers, pressure transducers, or analog chart recorders.\nEffect of density on measurements.\nIn the tube anemometer the dynamic pressure is actually being measured, although the scale is usually graduated as a velocity scale. If the actual air density differs from the calibration value, due to differing temperature, elevation or barometric pressure, a correction is required to obtain the actual wind speed. Approximately 1.5% (1.6% above 6,000 feet) should be added to the velocity recorded by a tube anemometer for each 1000\u00a0ft (5% for each kilometer) above sea-level.\nEffect of icing.\nAt airports, it is essential to have accurate wind data under all conditions, including freezing precipitation. Anemometry is also required in monitoring and controlling the operation of wind turbines, which in cold environments are prone to in-cloud icing. Icing alters the aerodynamics of an anemometer and may entirely block it from operating. Therefore, anemometers used in these applications must be internally heated. Both cup anemometers and sonic anemometers are presently available with heated versions.\nInstrument location.\nIn order for wind speeds to be comparable from location to location, the effect of the terrain needs to be considered, especially in regard to height. Other considerations are the presence of trees, and both natural canyons and artificial canyons (urban buildings). The standard anemometer height in open rural terrain is 10 meters."}
{"id": "2995", "revid": "37179761", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=2995", "title": "Archaeopteryx", "text": "Archaeopteryx (; ), sometimes referred to by its German name, (lit. 'original bird' or 'first bird'), is a genus of bird-like dinosaurs. The name derives from the ancient Greek (\"archa\u012bos\"), meaning \"ancient\", and (\"pt\u00e9ryx\"), meaning \"feather\" or \"wing\". Between the late 19th century and the early 21st century, \"Archaeopteryx\" was generally accepted by palaeontologists and popular reference books as the oldest known bird (member of the group Avialae). Older potential avialans have since been identified, including \"Anchiornis\", \"Xiaotingia\", and \"Aurornis\".\n\"Archaeopteryx\" lived in the Late Jurassic around 150\u00a0million years ago, in what is now southern Germany and also Portugal, during a time when Europe was an archipelago of islands in a shallow warm tropical sea, much closer to the equator than it is now. Similar in size to a Eurasian magpie, with the largest individuals possibly attaining the size of a raven, the largest species of \"Archaeopteryx\" could grow to about in length. Despite their small size, broad wings, and inferred ability to fly or glide, \"Archaeopteryx\" had more in common with other small Mesozoic dinosaurs than with modern birds. In particular, they shared the following features with the dromaeosaurids and troodontids: jaws with sharp teeth, three fingers with claws, a long bony tail, hyperextensible second toes (\"killing claw\"), feathers (which also suggest warm-bloodedness), and various features of the skeleton.\nThese features make \"Archaeopteryx\" a clear candidate for a transitional fossil between non-avian dinosaurs and birds. Thus, \"Archaeopteryx\" plays an important role, not only in the study of the origin of birds, but in the study of dinosaurs. It was named from a single feather in 1861, the identity of which has been controversial. That same year, the first complete specimen of \"Archaeopteryx\" was announced. Over the years, ten more fossils of \"Archaeopteryx\" have surfaced. Despite variation among these fossils, most experts regard all the remains that have been discovered as belonging to a single species, although this is still debated.\n\"Archaeopteryx\" was long considered to be the beginning of the evolutionary tree of birds. It has qualities that helped define what it is like to be a bird, such as its long, powerful front limbs. However, in recent years, the discovery of several small, feathered dinosaurs has created a mystery for paleontologists, raising questions about which animals are the ancestors of modern birds and which are their relatives.\nMost of these eleven fossils include impressions of feathers. Because these feathers are of an advanced form (flight feathers), these fossils are evidence that the evolution of feathers began before the Late Jurassic. The type specimen of \"Archaeopteryx\" was discovered just two years after Charles Darwin published \"On the Origin of Species\". \"Archaeopteryx\" seemed to confirm Darwin's theories and has since become a key piece of evidence for the origin of birds, the transitional fossils debate, and confirmation of evolution.\nHistory of discovery.\nOver the years, twelve body fossil specimens of \"Archaeopteryx\" have been found. All of the fossils come from the limestone deposits, quarried for centuries, near , Germany.\nThe initial discovery, a single feather, was unearthed in 1860 or 1861 and described in 1861 by . It is currently located at the Natural History Museum of Berlin. Though it was the initial holotype, there were indications that it might not have been from the same animal as the body fossils. In 2019 it was reported that laser imaging had revealed the structure of the quill (which had not been visible since some time after the feather was described), and that the feather was inconsistent with the morphology of all other \"Archaeopteryx\" feathers known, leading to the conclusion that it originated from another dinosaur. This conclusion was challenged in 2020 as being unlikely; the feather was identified on the basis of morphology as most likely having been an upper major primary covert feather.\nThe first skeleton, known as the London Specimen (BMNH 37001), was unearthed in 1861 near , Germany, and perhaps given to local physician in return for medical services. He then sold it for \u00a3700 (roughly \u00a383,000 in 2020) to the Natural History Museum in London, where it remains. Missing most of its head and neck, it was described in 1863 by Richard Owen as \"Archaeopteryx macrura\", allowing for the possibility it did not belong to the same species as the feather. In the subsequent fourth edition of his \"On the Origin of Species\", Charles Darwin described how some authors had maintained \"that the whole class of birds came suddenly into existence during the eocene period; but now we know, on the authority of Professor Owen, that a bird certainly lived during the deposition of the upper greensand; and still more recently, that strange bird, the \"Archaeopteryx\", with a long lizard-like tail, bearing a pair of feathers on each joint, and with its wings furnished with two free claws, has been discovered in the oolitic slates of Solnhofen. Hardly any recent discovery shows more forcibly than this how little we as yet know of the former inhabitants of the world.\"\nThe Greek word () means 'ancient, primeval'. primarily means 'wing', but it can also be just 'feather'. Meyer suggested this in his description. At first he referred to a single feather which appeared to resemble a modern bird's remex (wing feather), but he had heard of and been shown a rough sketch of the London specimen, to which he referred as a \"\" (\"skeleton of an animal covered in similar feathers\"). In German, this ambiguity is resolved by the term which does not necessarily mean a wing used for flying. was the favoured translation of \"Archaeopteryx\" among German scholars in the late nineteenth century. In English, 'ancient pinion' offers a rough approximation to this.\nSince then twelve specimens have been recovered:\nThe Berlin Specimen (HMN 1880/81) was discovered in 1874 or 1875 on the Blumenberg near , Germany, by farmer Jakob Niemeyer. He sold this precious fossil for the money to buy a cow in 1876, to innkeeper Johann D\u00f6rr, who again sold it to Ernst Otto H\u00e4berlein, the son of K. H\u00e4berlein. Placed on sale between 1877 and 1881, with potential buyers including O. C. Marsh of Yale University's Peabody Museum, it eventually was bought for 20,000 Goldmark by the Berlin's Natural History Museum, where it now is displayed. The transaction was financed by Ernst Werner von Siemens, founder of the famous company that bears his name. Described in 1884 by Wilhelm Dames, it is the most complete specimen, and the first with a complete head. In 1897 it was named by Dames as a new species, \"A. siemensii\"; though often considered a synonym of \"A. lithographica\", several 21st century studies have concluded that it is a distinct species which includes the Berlin, Munich, and Thermopolis specimens.\nComposed of a torso, the Maxberg Specimen (S5) was discovered in 1956 near Langenaltheim; it was brought to the attention of professor Florian Heller in 1958 and described by him in 1959. The specimen is missing its head and tail, although the rest of the skeleton is mostly intact. Although it was once exhibited at the Maxberg Museum in Solnhofen, it is currently missing. It belonged to Eduard Opitsch, who loaned it to the museum until 1974. After his death in 1991, it was discovered that the specimen was missing and may have been stolen or sold.\nThe Haarlem Specimen (TM 6428/29, also known as the \"Teylers Specimen\") was discovered in 1855 near , Germany, and described as a \"Pterodactylus crassipes\" in 1857 by Meyer. It was reclassified in 1970 by John Ostrom and is currently located at the Teylers Museum in Haarlem, the Netherlands. It was the very first specimen found, but was incorrectly classified at the time. It is also one of the least complete specimens, consisting mostly of limb bones, isolated cervical vertebrae, and ribs. In 2017 it was named as a separate genus \"Ostromia\", considered more closely related to \"Anchiornis\" from China.\nThe Eichst\u00e4tt Specimen (JM 2257) was discovered in 1951 near Workerszell, Germany, and described by Peter Wellnhofer in 1974. Currently located at the Jura Museum in Eichst\u00e4tt, Germany, it is the smallest known specimen and has the second best head. It is possibly a separate genus (\"Jurapteryx recurva\") or species (\"A. recurva\").\nThe Solnhofen Specimen (unnumbered specimen) was discovered in the 1970s near Eichst\u00e4tt, Germany, and described in 1988 by Wellnhofer. Currently located at the B\u00fcrgermeister-M\u00fcller-Museum in Solnhofen, it originally was classified as \"Compsognathus\" by an amateur collector, the same mayor Friedrich M\u00fcller after which the museum is named. It is the largest specimen known and may belong to a separate genus and species, \"Wellnhoferia grandis\". It is missing only portions of the neck, tail, backbone, and head.\nThe Munich Specimen (BSP 1999 I 50, formerly known as the \"Solenhofer-Aktien-Verein Specimen\") was discovered on 3 August 1992 near Langenaltheim and described in 1993 by Wellnhofer. It is currently located at the Pal\u00e4ontologisches Museum M\u00fcnchen in Munich, to which it was sold in 1999 for 1.9 million Deutschmark. What was initially believed to be a bony sternum turned out to be part of the coracoid, but a cartilaginous sternum may have been present. Only the front of its face is missing. It has been used as the basis for a distinct species, \"A. bavarica\", but more recent studies suggest it belongs to \"A. siemensii\".\nAn eighth, fragmentary specimen was discovered in 1990 in the younger M\u00f6rnsheim Formation at Daiting, Suevia. Therefore, it is known as the Daiting Specimen, and had been known since 1996 only from a cast, briefly shown at the Naturkundemuseum in Bamberg. The original was purchased by palaeontologist Raimund Albertsd\u00f6rfer in 2009. It was on display for the first time with six other original fossils of \"Archaeopteryx\" at the Munich Mineral Show in October 2009. The Daiting Specimen was subsequently named \"Archaeopteryx albersdoerferi\" by Kundrat et al. (2018).\nAnother fragmentary fossil was found in 2000. It is in private possession and, since 2004, on loan to the B\u00fcrgermeister-M\u00fcller Museum in Solnhofen, so it is called the B\u00fcrgermeister-M\u00fcller Specimen; the institute itself officially refers to it as the \"Exemplar of the families Ottman &amp; Steil, Solnhofen\". As the fragment represents the remains of a single wing of \"Archaeopteryx\", the popular name of this fossil is \"chicken wing\".\nLong in a private collection in Switzerland, the Thermopolis Specimen (WDC CSG 100) was discovered in Bavaria and described in 2005 by Mayr, Pohl, and Peters. Donated to the Wyoming Dinosaur Center in Thermopolis, Wyoming, it has the best-preserved head and feet; most of the neck and the lower jaw have not been preserved. The \"Thermopolis\" specimen was described on 2 December 2005 \"Science\" journal article as \"A well-preserved \"Archaeopteryx\" specimen with theropod features\"; it shows that \"Archaeopteryx\" lacked a reversed toe\u2014a universal feature of birds\u2014limiting its ability to perch on branches and implying a terrestrial or trunk-climbing lifestyle. This has been interpreted as evidence of theropod ancestry. In 1988, Gregory S. Paul claimed to have found evidence of a hyperextensible second toe, but this was not verified and accepted by other scientists until the Thermopolis specimen was described. \"Until now, the feature was thought to belong only to the species' close relatives, the deinonychosaurs.\" The Thermopolis Specimen was assigned to \"Archaeopteryx siemensii\" in 2007. The specimen is considered to represent the most complete and best-preserved \"Archaeopteryx\" remains yet.\nThe discovery of an eleventh specimen was announced in 2011, and it was described in 2014. It is one of the more complete specimens, but is missing much of the skull and one forelimb. It is privately owned and has yet to be given a name.\nPalaeontologists of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich studied the specimen, which revealed previously unknown features of the plumage, such as feathers on both the upper and lower legs and metatarsus, and the only preserved tail tip.\nA twelfth specimen had been discovered by an amateur collector in 2010 at the Schamhaupten quarry, but the finding was only announced in February 2014. It was scientifically described in 2018. It represents a complete and mostly articulated skeleton with skull. It is the only specimen lacking preserved feathers. It is from the Painten Formation and somewhat older than the other specimens.\nAuthenticity.\nBeginning in 1985, an amateur group including astronomer Fred Hoyle and physicist Lee Spetner published a series of papers claiming that the feathers on the Berlin and London specimens of \"Archaeopteryx\" were forged. Their claims were repudiated by Alan J. Charig and others at the Natural History Museum in London. Most of their supposed evidence for a forgery was based on unfamiliarity with the processes of lithification; for example, they proposed that, based on the difference in texture associated with the feathers, feather impressions were applied to a thin layer of cement, without realizing that feathers themselves would have caused a textural difference. They also misinterpreted the fossils, claiming that the tail was forged as one large feather, when visibly this is not the case. In addition, they claimed that the other specimens of \"Archaeopteryx\" known at the time did not have feathers, which is incorrect; the Maxberg and Eichst\u00e4tt specimens have obvious feathers.\nThey also expressed disbelief that slabs would split so smoothly, or that one half of a slab containing fossils would have good preservation, but not the counterslab. These are common properties of Solnhofen fossils, because the dead animals would fall onto hardened surfaces, which would form a natural plane for the future slabs to split along and would leave the bulk of the fossil on one side and little on the other.\nFinally, the motives they suggested for a forgery are not strong, and are contradictory; one is that Richard Owen wanted to forge evidence in support of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, which is unlikely given Owen's views toward Darwin and his theory. The other is that Owen wanted to set a trap for Darwin, hoping the latter would support the fossils so Owen could discredit him with the forgery; this is unlikely because Owen wrote a detailed paper on the London specimen, so such an action would certainly backfire.\nCharig \"et al.\" pointed to the presence of hairline cracks in the slabs running through both rock and fossil impressions, and mineral growth over the slabs that had occurred before discovery and preparation, as evidence that the feathers were original. Spetner \"et al.\" then attempted to show that the cracks would have propagated naturally through their postulated cement layer, but neglected to account for the fact that the cracks were old and had been filled with calcite, and thus were not able to propagate. They also attempted to show the presence of cement on the London specimen through X-ray spectroscopy, and did find something that was not rock; it was not cement either, and is most probably a fragment of silicone rubber left behind when moulds were made of the specimen. Their suggestions have not been taken seriously by palaeontologists, as their evidence was largely based on misunderstandings of geology, and they never discussed the other feather-bearing specimens, which have increased in number since then. Charig \"et al.\" reported a discolouration: a dark band between two layers of limestone \u2013 they say it is the product of sedimentation. It is natural for limestone to take on the colour of its surroundings and most limestones are coloured (if not colour banded) to some degree, so the darkness was attributed to such impurities. They also mention that a complete absence of air bubbles in the rock slabs is further proof that the specimen is authentic.\nDescription.\nMost of the specimens of \"Archaeopteryx\" that have been discovered come from the Solnhofen limestone in Bavaria, southern Germany, which is a , a rare and remarkable geological formation known for its superbly detailed fossils laid down during the early Tithonian stage of the Jurassic period, approximately 150.8\u2013148.5million years ago.\n\"Archaeopteryx\" was roughly the size of a raven, with broad wings that were rounded at the ends and a long tail compared to its body length. It could reach up to in body length, with an estimated mass of . \"Archaeopteryx\" feathers, although less documented than its other features, were very similar in structure to modern-day bird feathers. Despite the presence of numerous avian features, \"Archaeopteryx\" had many non-avian theropod dinosaur characteristics. Unlike modern birds, \"Archaeopteryx\" had small teeth, as well as a long bony tail, features which \"Archaeopteryx\" shared with other dinosaurs of the time.\nBecause it displays features common to both birds and non-avian dinosaurs, \"Archaeopteryx\" has often been considered a link between them. In the 1970s, John Ostrom, following Thomas Henry Huxley's lead in 1868, argued that birds evolved within theropod dinosaurs and \"Archaeopteryx\" was a critical piece of evidence for this argument; it had several avian features, such as a wishbone, flight feathers, wings, and a partially reversed first toe along with dinosaur and theropod features. For instance, it has a long ascending process of the ankle bone, interdental plates, an obturator process of the ischium, and long chevrons in the tail. In particular, Ostrom found that \"Archaeopteryx\" was remarkably similar to the theropod family Dromaeosauridae.\nArchaeopteryx had three separate digits on each fore-leg each ending with a \"claw\". Few birds have such features. Some birds such as ducks, swans and Jacanas (\"Jacana\" sp.) and the hoatzin (\"Opisthocomus hoazin\") have them concealed beneath the feathers.\nPlumage.\nSpecimens of \"Archaeopteryx\" were most notable for their well-developed flight feathers. They were markedly asymmetrical and showed the structure of flight feathers in modern birds, with vanes given stability by a barb-barbule-barbicel arrangement. The tail feathers were less asymmetrical, again in line with the situation in modern birds and also had firm vanes. The thumb did not yet bear a separately movable tuft of stiff feathers.\nThe body plumage of \"Archaeopteryx\" is less well documented and has only been properly researched in the well-preserved Berlin specimen. Thus, as more than one species seems to be involved, the research into the Berlin specimen's feathers does not necessarily hold true for the rest of the species of \"Archaeopteryx\". In the Berlin specimen, there are \"trousers\" of well-developed feathers on the legs; some of these feathers seem to have a basic contour feather structure, but are somewhat decomposed (they lack barbicels as in ratites). In part they are firm and thus capable of supporting flight.\nA patch of pennaceous feathers is found running along its back, which was quite similar to the contour feathers of the body plumage of modern birds in being symmetrical and firm, although not as stiff as the flight-related feathers. Apart from that, the feather traces in the Berlin specimen are limited to a sort of \"proto-down\" not dissimilar to that found in the dinosaur \"Sinosauropteryx\": decomposed and fluffy, and possibly even appearing more like fur than feathers in life (although not in their microscopic structure). These occur on the remainder of the body\u2014although some feathers did not fossilize and others were obliterated during preparation, leaving bare patches on specimens\u2014and the lower neck.\nThere is no indication of feathering on the upper neck and head. While these conceivably may have been nude, this may still be an artefact of preservation. It appears that most \"Archaeopteryx\" specimens became embedded in anoxic sediment after drifting some time on their backs in the sea\u2014the head, neck and the tail are generally bent downward, which suggests that the specimens had just started to rot when they were embedded, with tendons and muscle relaxing so that the characteristic shape (death pose) of the fossil specimens was achieved. This would mean that the skin already was softened and loose, which is bolstered by the fact that in some specimens the flight feathers were starting to detach at the point of embedding in the sediment. So it is hypothesized that the pertinent specimens moved along the sea bed in shallow water for some time before burial, the head and upper neck feathers sloughing off, while the more firmly attached tail feathers remained.\nColouration.\nIn 2011, graduate student Ryan Carney and colleagues performed the first colour study on an \"Archaeopteryx\" specimen. Using scanning electron microscopy technology and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, the team was able to detect the structure of melanosomes in the isolated feather specimen described in 1861. The resultant measurements were then compared to those of 87\u00a0modern bird species, and the original colour was calculated with a 95% likelihood to be black. The feather was determined to be black throughout, with heavier pigmentation in the distal tip. The feather studied was most probably a dorsal covert, which would have partly covered the primary feathers on the wings. The study does not mean that \"Archaeopteryx\" was entirely black, but suggests that it had some black colouration which included the coverts. Carney pointed out that this is consistent with what we know of modern flight characteristics, in that black melanosomes have structural properties that strengthen feathers for flight. In a 2013 study published in the \"Journal of Analytical Atomic Spectrometry\", new analyses of \"Archaeopteryx\"'s feathers revealed that the animal may have had complex light- and dark-coloured plumage, with heavier pigmentation in the distal tips and outer vanes. This analysis of color distribution was based primarily on the distribution of sulphate with the fossil. An author on the previous \"Archaeopteryx\" color study argued against the interpretation of copper as an indicator of eumelanin in the full Archaeopteryx specimen but made no mention of the sulphate distribution. A press release and conference abstract by Carney also argue against the 2013 study however, no new evidence has been published.\nClassification.\nToday, fossils of the genus \"Archaeopteryx\" are usually assigned to one or two species, \"A. lithographica\" and \"A. siemensii\", but their taxonomic history is complicated. Ten names have been published for the handful of specimens. As interpreted today, the name \"A. lithographica\" only referred to the single feather described by Meyer. In 1954 Gavin de Beer concluded that the London specimen was the holotype. In 1960, Swinton accordingly proposed that the name \"Archaeopteryx lithographica\" be placed on the official genera list making the alternative names \"Griphosaurus\" and \"Griphornis\" invalid. The ICZN, implicitly accepting de Beer's standpoint, did indeed suppress the plethora of alternative names initially proposed for the first skeleton specimens, which mainly resulted from the acrimonious dispute between Meyer and his opponent Johann Andreas Wagner (whose \"Griphosaurus problematicus\" \u2013 'problematic riddle-lizard' \u2013 was a vitriolic sneer at Meyer's \"Archaeopteryx\"). In addition, in 1977, the Commission ruled that the first species name of the Haarlem specimen, \"crassipes\", described by Meyer as a pterosaur before its true nature was realized, was not to be given preference over \"lithographica\" in instances where scientists considered them to represent the same species.\nIt has been noted that the feather, the first specimen of \"Archaeopteryx\" described, does not correspond well with the flight-related feathers of \"Archaeopteryx\". It certainly is a flight feather of a contemporary species, but its size and proportions indicate that it may belong to another, smaller species of feathered theropod, of which only this feather is known so far. As the feather had been designated the type specimen, the name \"Archaeopteryx\" should then no longer be applied to the skeletons, thus creating significant nomenclatorial confusion. In 2007, two sets of scientists therefore petitioned the ICZN requesting that the London specimen explicitly be made the type by designating it as the new holotype specimen, or neotype. This suggestion was upheld by the ICZN after four years of debate, and the London specimen was designated the neotype on 3 October 2011.\nBelow is a cladogram published in 2013 by Godefroit \"et al.\"\nSpecies.\nIt has been argued that all the specimens belong to the same species, \"A. lithographica\". Differences do exist among the specimens, and while some researchers regard these as due to the different ages of the specimens, some may be related to actual species diversity. In particular, the Munich, Eichst\u00e4tt, Solnhofen, and Thermopolis specimens differ from the London, Berlin, and Haarlem specimens in being smaller or much larger, having different finger proportions, having more slender snouts lined with forward-pointing teeth, and possible presence of a sternum. Due to these differences, most individual specimens have been given their own species name at one point or another. The Berlin specimen has been designated as \"Archaeornis siemensii\", the Eichst\u00e4tt specimen as \"Jurapteryx recurva\", the Munich specimen as \"Archaeopteryx bavarica\", and the Solnhofen specimen as \"Wellnhoferia grandis\".\nIn 2007, a review of all well-preserved specimens including the then-newly discovered Thermopolis specimen concluded that two distinct species of \"Archaeopteryx\" could be supported: \"A. lithographica\" (consisting of at least the London and Solnhofen specimens), and \"A. siemensii\" (consisting of at least the Berlin, Munich, and Thermopolis specimens). The two species are distinguished primarily by large flexor tubercles on the foot claws in \"A. lithographica\" (the claws of \"A. siemensii\" specimens being relatively simple and straight). \"A. lithographica\" also had a constricted portion of the crown in some teeth and a stouter metatarsus. A supposed additional species, \"Wellnhoferia grandis\" (based on the Solnhofen specimen), seems to be indistinguishable from \"A. lithographica\" except in its larger size.\nSynonyms.\nIf two names are given, the first denotes the original describer of the \"species\", the second the author on whom the given name combination is based. As always in zoological nomenclature, putting an author's name in parentheses denotes that the taxon was originally described in a different genus.\n\"\"Archaeopteryx\" vicensensis\" (Anon. \"fide\" Lambrecht, 1933) is a \"nomen nudum\" for what appears to be an undescribed pterosaur.\nPhylogenetic position.\nModern paleontology has often classified \"Archaeopteryx\" as the most primitive bird. It is not thought to be a true ancestor of modern birds, but rather, a close relative of that ancestor. Nonetheless, \"Archaeopteryx\" was often used as a model of the true ancestral bird. Several authors have done so. Lowe (1935) and Thulborn (1984) questioned whether \"Archaeopteryx\" truly was the first bird. They suggested that \"Archaeopteryx\" was a dinosaur that was no more closely related to birds than were other dinosaur groups. Kurzanov (1987) suggested that \"Avimimus\" was more likely to be the ancestor of all birds than \"Archaeopteryx\". Barsbold (1983) and Zweers and Van den Berge (1997) noted that many maniraptoran lineages are extremely birdlike, and they suggested that different groups of birds may have descended from different dinosaur ancestors.\nThe discovery of the closely related \"Xiaotingia\" in 2011 led to new phylogenetic analyses that suggested that \"Archaeopteryx\" is a deinonychosaur rather than an avialan, and therefore, not a \"bird\" under most common uses of that term. A more thorough analysis was published soon after to test this hypothesis, and failed to arrive at the same result; it found \"Archaeopteryx\" in its traditional position at the base of Avialae, while \"Xiaotingia\" was recovered as a basal dromaeosaurid or troodontid. The authors of the follow-up study noted that uncertainties still exist, and that it may not be possible to state confidently whether or not \"Archaeopteryx\" is a member of Avialae or not, barring new and better specimens of relevant species.\nPhylogenetic studies conducted by Senter, \"et al.\" (2012) and Turner, Makovicky, and Norell (2012) also \"Archaeopteryx\" to be more closely related to living birds than to dromaeosaurids and troodontids. On the other hand, Godefroit, \"et al.\" (2013) recovered \"Archaeopteryx\" as more closely related to dromaeosaurids and troodontids in the analysis included in their description of \"Eosinopteryx brevipenna\". The authors used a modified version of the matrix from the study describing \"Xiaotingia\", adding \"Jinfengopteryx elegans\" and \"Eosinopteryx brevipenna\" to it, as well as adding four additional characters related to the development of the plumage. Unlike the analysis from the description of \"Xiaotingia\", the analysis conducted by Godefroit, \"et al.\" did not find \"Archaeopteryx\" to be related particularly closely to \"Anchiornis\" and \"Xiaotingia\", which were recovered as basal troodontids instead.\nAgnol\u00edn and Novas (2013) found \"Archaeopteryx\" and (possibly synonymous) \"Wellnhoferia\" to be form a clade sister to the lineage including \"Jeholornis\" and Pygostylia, with Microraptoria, Unenlagiinae, and the clade containing \"Anchiornis\" and \"Xiaotingia\" being successively closer outgroups to the Avialae (defined by the authors as the clade stemming from the last common ancestor of \"Archaeopteryx\" and Aves). Another phylogenetic study by Godefroit, \"et al.\", using a more inclusive matrix than the one from the analysis in the description of \"Eosinopteryx brevipenna\", also found \"Archaeopteryx\" to be a member of Avialae (defined by the authors as the most inclusive clade containing \"Passer domesticus\", but not \"Dromaeosaurus albertensis\" or \"Troodon formosus\"). \"Archaeopteryx\" was found to form a grade at the base of Avialae with \"Xiaotingia\", \"Anchiornis\", and \"Aurornis\". Compared to \"Archaeopteryx\", \"Xiaotingia\" was found to be more closely related to extant birds, while both \"Anchiornis\" and \"Aurornis\" were found to be more distantly so.\nHu \"et al\". (2018), Wang \"et al\". (2018) and Hartman \"et al\". (2019) found \"Archaeopteryx\" to have been a deinonychosaur instead of an avialan. More specifically, it and closely related taxa were considered basal deinonychosaurs, with dromaeosaurids and troodontids forming together a parallel lineage within the group. Because Hartman \"et al\". found \"Archaeopteryx\" isolated in a group of flightless deinonychosaurs (otherwise considered \"anchiornithids\"), they considered it highly probable that this animal evolved flight independently from bird ancestors (and from \"Microraptor\" and \"Yi\"). The following cladogram illustrates their hypothesis regarding the position of \"Archaeopteryx\":\nThe authors, however, found that the \"Archaeopteryx\" being an avialan was only slightly less likely than this hypothesis, and as likely as Archaeopterygidae and Troodontidae being sister clades.\nPalaeobiology.\nFlight.\nAs in the wings of modern birds, the flight feathers of \"Archaeopteryx\" were somewhat asymmetrical and the tail feathers were rather broad. This implies that the wings and tail were used for lift generation, but it is unclear whether \"Archaeopteryx\" was capable of flapping flight or simply a glider. The lack of a bony breastbone suggests that \"Archaeopteryx\" was not a very strong flier, but flight muscles might have attached to the thick, boomerang-shaped wishbone, the platelike coracoids, or perhaps, to a cartilaginous sternum. The sideways orientation of the glenoid (shoulder) joint between scapula, coracoid, and humerus\u2014instead of the dorsally angled arrangement found in modern birds\u2014may indicate that \"Archaeopteryx\" was unable to lift its wings above its back, a requirement for the upstroke found in modern flapping flight. According to a study by Philip Senter in 2006, \"Archaeopteryx\" was indeed unable to use flapping flight as modern birds do, but it may well have used a downstroke-only flap-assisted gliding technique. However, a more recent study solves this issue by suggesting a different flight stroke configuration for non-avian flying theropods.\n\"Archaeopteryx\" wings were relatively large, which would have resulted in a low stall speed and reduced turning radius. The short and rounded shape of the wings would have increased drag, but also could have improved its ability to fly through cluttered environments such as trees and brush (similar wing shapes are seen in birds that fly through trees and brush, such as crows and pheasants). The presence of \"hind wings\", asymmetrical flight feathers stemming from the legs similar to those seen in dromaeosaurids such as \"Microraptor\", also would have added to the aerial mobility of \"Archaeopteryx\". The first detailed study of the hind wings by Longrich in 2006, suggested that the structures formed up to 12% of the total airfoil. This would have reduced stall speed by up to 6% and turning radius by up to 12%.\nThe feathers of \"Archaeopteryx\" were asymmetrical. This has been interpreted as evidence that it was a flyer, because flightless birds tend to have symmetrical feathers. Some scientists, including Thomson and Speakman, have questioned this. They studied more than 70 families of living birds, and found that some flightless types do have a range of asymmetry in their feathers, and that the feathers of \"Archaeopteryx\" fall into this range. The degree of asymmetry seen in \"Archaeopteryx\" is more typical for slow flyers than for flightless birds.\nIn 2010, Robert L. Nudds and Gareth J. Dyke in the journal \"Science\" published a paper in which they analysed the rachises of the primary feathers of \"Confuciusornis\" and \"Archaeopteryx\". The analysis suggested that the rachises on these two genera were thinner and weaker than those of modern birds relative to body mass. The authors determined that \"Archaeopteryx\" and \"Confuciusornis\", were unable to use flapping flight. This study was criticized by Philip J. Currie and Luis Chiappe. Chiappe suggested that it is difficult to measure the rachises of fossilized feathers, and Currie speculated that \"Archaeopteryx\" and \"Confuciusornis\" must have been able to fly to some degree, as their fossils are preserved in what is believed to have been marine or lake sediments, suggesting that they must have been able to fly over deep water. Gregory Paul also disagreed with the study, arguing in a 2010 response that Nudds and Dyke had overestimated the masses of these early birds, and that more accurate mass estimates allowed powered flight even with relatively narrow rachises. Nudds and Dyke had assumed a mass of for the Munich specimen \"Archaeopteryx\", a young juvenile, based on published mass estimates of larger specimens. Paul argued that a more reasonable body mass estimate for the Munich specimen is about . Paul also criticized the measurements of the rachises themselves, noting that the feathers in the Munich specimen are poorly preserved. Nudds and Dyke reported a diameter of for the longest primary feather, which Paul could not confirm using photographs. Paul measured some of the inner primary feathers, finding rachises across. Despite these criticisms, Nudds and Dyke stood by their original conclusions. They claimed that Paul's statement, that an adult \"Archaeopteryx\" would have been a better flyer than the juvenile Munich specimen, was dubious. This, they reasoned, would require an even thicker rachis, evidence for which has not yet been presented. Another possibility is that they had not achieved true flight, but instead used their wings as aids for extra lift while running over water after the fashion of the basilisk lizard, which could explain their presence in lake and marine deposits (see Evolution of bird flight).\nIn 2004, scientists analysing a detailed CT scan of the braincase of the London \"Archaeopteryx\" concluded that its brain was significantly larger than that of most dinosaurs, indicating that it possessed the brain size necessary for flying. The overall brain anatomy was reconstructed using the scan. The reconstruction showed that the regions associated with vision took up nearly one-third of the brain. Other well-developed areas involved hearing and muscle coordination. The skull scan also revealed the structure of its inner ear. The structure more closely resembles that of modern birds than the inner ear of non-avian reptiles. These characteristics taken together suggest that \"Archaeopteryx\" had the keen sense of hearing, balance, spatial perception, and coordination needed to fly. \"Archaeopteryx\" had a cerebrum-to-brain-volume ratio 78% of the way to modern birds from the condition of non-coelurosaurian dinosaurs such as \"Carcharodontosaurus\" or \"Allosaurus\", which had a crocodile-like anatomy of the brain and inner ear. Newer research shows that while the \"Archaeopteryx\" brain was more complex than that of more primitive theropods, it had a more generalized brain volume among Maniraptora dinosaurs, even smaller than that of other non-avian dinosaurs in several instances, which indicates the neurological development required for flight was already a common trait in the maniraptoran clade.\nRecent studies of flight feather barb geometry reveal that modern birds possess a larger barb angle in the trailing vane of the feather, whereas \"Archaeopteryx\" lacks this large barb angle, indicating potentially weak flight abilities.\n\"Archaeopteryx\" continues to play an important part in scientific debates about the origin and evolution of birds. Some scientists see it as a semi-arboreal climbing animal, following the idea that birds evolved from tree-dwelling gliders (the \"trees down\" hypothesis for the evolution of flight proposed by O. C. Marsh). Other scientists see \"Archaeopteryx\" as running quickly along the ground, supporting the idea that birds evolved flight by running (the \"ground up\" hypothesis proposed by Samuel Wendell Williston). Still others suggest that \"Archaeopteryx\" might have been at home both in the trees and on the ground, like modern crows, and this latter view is what currently is considered best-supported by morphological characters. Altogether, it appears that the species was not particularly specialized for running on the ground or for perching. A scenario outlined by El\u017canowski in 2002 suggested that \"Archaeopteryx\" used its wings mainly to escape predators by glides punctuated with shallow downstrokes to reach successively higher perches, and alternatively, to cover longer distances (mainly) by gliding down from cliffs or treetops.\nIn March 2018, scientists reported that \"Archaeopteryx\" was likely capable of flight, but in a manner distinct and substantially different from that of modern birds. This study on \"Archaeopteryx\"'s bone histology suggests that it was closest to true flying birds, and in particular to pheasants and other burst flyers.\nStudies of \"Archaeopteryx's\" feather sheaths revealed that like modern birds, it had a center-out, flight related molting strategy. As it was a weak flier, this was extremely advantageous in preserving its maximum flight performance.\nGrowth.\nA histological study by Erickson, Norell, Zhongue, and others in 2009 estimated that \"Archaeopteryx\" grew relatively slowly compared to modern birds, presumably because the outermost portions of \"Archaeopteryx\" bones appear poorly vascularized; in living vertebrates, poorly vascularized bone is correlated with slow growth rate. They also assume that all known skeletons of \"Archaeopteryx\" come from juvenile specimens. Because the bones of \"Archaeopteryx\" could not be histologically sectioned in a formal skeletochronological (growth ring) analysis, Erickson and colleagues used bone vascularity (porosity) to estimate bone growth rate. They assumed that poorly vascularized bone grows at similar rates in all birds and in \"Archaeopteryx\". The poorly vascularized bone of \"Archaeopteryx\" might have grown as slowly as that in a mallard (2.5 micrometres per day) or as fast as that in an ostrich (4.2 micrometres per day). Using this range of bone growth rates, they calculated how long it would take to \"grow\" each specimen of \"Archaeopteryx\" to the observed size; it may have taken at least 970 days (there were 375 days in a Late Jurassic year) to reach an adult size of . The study also found that the avialans \"Jeholornis\" and \"Sapeornis\" grew relatively slowly, as did the dromaeosaurid \"Mahakala\". The avialans \"Confuciusornis\" and \"Ichthyornis\" grew relatively quickly, following a growth trend similar to that of modern birds. One of the few modern birds that exhibit slow growth is the flightless kiwi, and the authors speculated that \"Archaeopteryx\" and the kiwi had similar basal metabolic rate.\nDaily activity patterns.\nComparisons between the scleral rings of \"Archaeopteryx\" and modern birds and reptiles indicate that it may have been diurnal, similar to most modern birds.\nPaleoecology.\nThe richness and diversity of the Solnhofen limestones in which all specimens of \"Archaeopteryx\" have been found have shed light on an ancient Jurassic Bavaria strikingly different from the present day. The latitude was similar to Florida, though the climate was likely to have been drier, as evidenced by fossils of plants with adaptations for arid conditions and a lack of terrestrial sediments characteristic of rivers. Evidence of plants, although scarce, include cycads and conifers while animals found include a large number of insects, small lizards, pterosaurs, and \"Compsognathus\".\nThe excellent preservation of \"Archaeopteryx\" fossils and other terrestrial fossils found at Solnhofen indicates that they did not travel far before becoming preserved. The \"Archaeopteryx\" specimens found were therefore likely to have lived on the low islands surrounding the Solnhofen lagoon rather than to have been corpses that drifted in from farther away. \"Archaeopteryx\" skeletons are considerably less numerous in the deposits of Solnhofen than those of pterosaurs, of which seven genera have been found. The pterosaurs included species such as \"Rhamphorhynchus\" belonging to the Rhamphorhynchidae, the group which dominated the niche currently occupied by seabirds, and which became extinct at the end of the Jurassic. The pterosaurs, which also included \"Pterodactylus\", were common enough that it is unlikely that the specimens found are vagrants from the larger islands to the north.\nThe islands that surrounded the Solnhofen lagoon were low lying, semi-arid, and sub-tropical with a long dry season and little rain. The closest modern analogue for the Solnhofen conditions is said to be Orca Basin in the northern Gulf of Mexico, although it is much deeper than the Solnhofen lagoons. The flora of these islands was adapted to these dry conditions and consisted mostly of low () shrubs. Contrary to reconstructions of \"Archaeopteryx\" climbing large trees, these seem to have been mostly absent from the islands; few trunks have been found in the sediments and fossilized tree pollen also is absent.\nThe lifestyle of \"Archaeopteryx\" is difficult to reconstruct and there are several theories regarding it. Some researchers suggest that it was primarily adapted to life on the ground, while other researchers suggest that it was principally arboreal on the basis of the curvature of the claws which has since been questioned. The absence of trees does not preclude \"Archaeopteryx\" from an arboreal lifestyle, as several species of bird live exclusively in low shrubs. Various aspects of the morphology of \"Archaeopteryx\" point to either an arboreal or ground existence, including the length of its legs and the elongation in its feet; some authorities consider it likely to have been a generalist capable of feeding in both shrubs and open ground, as well as along the shores of the lagoon. It most likely hunted small prey, seizing it with its jaws if it was small enough, or with its claws if it was larger."}

He was born and raised in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, a borough of New York City, New York, the elder of two children, and attended Erasmus Hall High School. His sister Edith suffered from chorea as a child.\nHis paternal grandparents were Orthodox Jews, and his mother's parents, although born Jewish, were atheists. His mother kept a kosher home for her husband's sake, but was lax about attending synagogue and observing the Jewish holidays. His Bar Mitzvah marked the end of Laurents's religious education and the beginning of his rejection of all fundamentalist religions, although he continued to identify himself as Jewish. However, late in life he admitted to having changed his last name from Levine to the less Jewish-sounding Laurents, \"to get a job.\"\nAfter graduating from Cornell University, Laurents took an evening class in radio writing at New York University. William N. Robson, his instructor, a CBS Radio director/producer, submitted his script \"Now Playing Tomorrow\", a comedic fantasy about clairvoyance, to the network, and it was produced in the Columbia Workshop series on January 30, 1939, with Shirley Booth in the lead role. It was Laurents' first professional credit. The show's success led to him being hired to write scripts for various radio shows, among them \"Lux Radio Theater\". Laurents' career was interrupted when he was drafted into the U.S. Army in the middle of World War II. Through a series of clerical errors, he never saw battle, but instead was assigned to the U.S. Army Pictorial Service located in a film studio in Astoria, Queens, where he wrote training films and met, among others, George Cukor and William Holden. He later was reassigned to write plays for \"Armed Service Force Presents\", a radio show that dramatized the contributions of all branches of the armed forces.\nTheatrical career.\nAccording to John Clum, \"Laurents was always a mirror of his times. Through his best work, one sees a staged history of leftist, gender, and gay politics in the decades after World War II.\" After graduating from Cornell University in 1937, Laurents went to work as a writer for radio drama at CBS in New York. His military duties during World War II, which consisted of writing training films and radio scripts for \"Armed Service Force Presents\", brought him into contact with some of the best film directors\u2014distinguished director George Cukor directed his first script. Laurents's work in radio and film during World War II was an excellent apprenticeship for a budding playwright and screenwriter. He also had the good fortune to be based in New York City. His first stage play, \"Home of the Brave\", was produced in 1945. The sale of the play to a film studio gave Laurents the entr\u00e9e he needed to become a Hollywood screenwriter though he continued, with mixed success, to write plays. The most important of his early screenplays is his adaptation of \"Rope\" for Alfred Hitchcock.\nSoon after being discharged from the Army, Laurents met ballerina Nora Kaye, and the two became involved in an on-again, off-again romantic relationship. While Kaye was on tour with \"Fancy Free\", Laurents continued to write for the radio but was becoming discontented with the medium. At the urging of Martin Gabel, he spent nine consecutive nights writing a play In 1962, Laurents directed \"I Can Get It for You Wholesale\", which helped to turn then-unknown Barbra Streisand into a star. His next project was the stage musical \"Anyone Can Whistle\", which he directed and for which he wrote the book, but it proved to be an infamous flop. He later had success with the musicals \"Hallelujah, Baby!\" (written for Lena Horne but ultimately starring Leslie Uggams) and \"La Cage Aux Folles\" (1983), which he directed, however \"Nick &amp; Nora\" was not successful.\nIn 2008, Laurents directed a Broadway revival of \"Gypsy\" starring Patti LuPone, and in 2009, he tackled a bilingual revival of \"West Side Story\", with Spanish translations of some dialogue and lyrics by Lin-Manuel Miranda. While preparing \"West Side Story\", he noted, \"The musical theatre and cultural conventions of 1957 made it next to impossible for the characters to have authenticity.\" Following the production's March 19 opening at the Palace Theatre, Ben Brantley of \"The New York Times\" called the translations \"an only partly successful experiment\" and added, \"Mr. Laurents has exchanged insolence for innocence and, as with most such bargains, there are dividends and losses.\" The national tour (2011-2012) was directed by David Saint, who was Laurents' assistant director on the Broadway production. The Spanish lyrics and dialog were reduced from about 18% of the total to about 10%.\nFilm career.\nLaurents' first Hollywood experience proved to be a frustrating disappointment. Director Anatole Litvak, unhappy with the script submitted by Frank Partos and Millen Brand for \"The Snake Pit\" (1948), hired Laurents to rewrite it. Partos and Brand later insisted the bulk of the shooting script was theirs, and produced carbon copies of many of the pages Laurents actually had written to bolster their claim. Having destroyed the original script and all his notes and rewritten pages after completing the project, Laurents had no way to prove most of the work was his, and the Writers Guild of America denied him screen credit. Brand later confessed he and Partos had copied scenes written by Laurents and apologized for his role in the deception. Four decades later, Laurents learned he was ineligible for WGA health benefits because he had failed to accumulate enough credits to qualify. He was short by one, the one he failed to get for \"The Snake Pit\".\nUpon hearing 20th Century Fox executives were pleased with Laurents' work on \"The Snake Pit\", Alfred Hitchcock hired him for his next project, the film \"Rope\" starring James Stewart. Hitchcock wanted Laurents to Americanize the British play \"Rope\" (1929) by Patrick Hamilton for the screen. With his then-lover Farley Granger set to star, Laurents was happy to accept the assignment. His dilemma was how to make the audience aware of the fact the three main characters were homosexual without blatantly saying so. The Hays Office kept close tabs on his work, and the final script was so discreet that Laurents was unsure whether co-star James Stewart ever realized that his character was gay. In later years, Hitchcock asked him to script both \"Torn Curtain\" (1966) and \"Topaz\" (1969), However, Laurents, in both cases unenthused by the material, declined the offers.\nLaurents also scripted \"Anastasia\" (1956) and \"Bonjour Tristesse\" (1958). \"The Way We Were\" (1973), in which he incorporated many of his own experiences, particularly those with the HUAC, reunited him with Barbra Streisand, and \"The Turning Point\" (1977), inspired in part by his love for Nora Kaye, was directed by her husband Herbert Ross. The Fox animated feature film \"Anastasia\" (1997) was based in part from his screenplay of the live-action 1956 film of the same title.\nBlacklist.\nBecause of a casual remark made by Russel Crouse, Laurents was called to Washington, D.C., to account for his political views. He explained himself to the House Un-American Activities Committee, and his appearance had no obvious impact on his career, which at the time was primarily in the theatre. When the McCarran Internal Security Act, which prohibited individuals suspected of engaging in subversive activities from obtaining a passport, was passed in 1950, Laurents and Granger immediately applied for and received passports and departed for Paris with Harold Clurman and his wife Stella Adler. Laurents and Granger remained abroad, traveling throughout Europe and northern Africa, for about 18 months.\nYears earlier, Laurents and Jerome Robbins had developed \"Look Ma, I'm Dancin'!\" (1948), a stage musical about the world of ballet that ran for 188 performances on Broadway, and starred Nancy Walker and Harold Lang. (Although the musical was ultimately produced with a book by Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee, as Laurents left the project.) Robbins approached Paramount Pictures about directing a screen version, and the studio agreed as long as Laurents was not part of the package.\nIt was not until then that Laurents learned he officially had been blacklisted, primarily because a review of \"Home of the Brave\" had been published in the \"Daily Worker\". He decided to return to Paris, but the State Department refused to renew his passport. Laurents spent three months trying to clear his name, and after submitting a lengthy letter explaining his political beliefs in detail, it was determined they were so idiosyncratic he could not have been a member of any subversive groups. Within a week his passport was renewed, and the following day he sailed for Europe on the \"Ile de France\". While on board, he received a cable from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer offering him a screenwriting assignment. The blacklist had ended.\nMemoirs.\nLaurents wrote \"Original Story By Arthur Laurents: A Memoir of Broadway and Hollywood\", published in 2000. In it, he discusses his lengthy career and his many gay affairs and long-term relationships, including those with Farley Granger and Tom Hatcher (August 24, 1929 - October 26, 2006). Hatcher was an aspiring actor whom Gore Vidal suggested Laurents seek out at the Beverly Hills men's clothing store Hatcher was managing at the time. The couple remained together for 52 years until Hatcher's death on October 26, 2006.\nLaurents wrote \"Mainly on Directing: Gypsy, West Side Story and Other Musicals\", published in 2009, in which he discussed musicals he directed and the work of other directors he admired.\nHis last memoir titled \"The Rest of the Story\" was published posthumously in September 2012.\nDeath.\nLaurents died at the age of 93 at his home in Manhattan on May 5, 2011 of pneumonia complications, as reported by \"The New York Times\". Following a long tradition, Broadway theatre lights were dimmed at 8 p.m. on May 6, 2011, for one minute in his memory. His ashes were buried alongside those of Tom Hatcher in a memorial bench in Quogue, Long Island, New York.\nAwards, nominations and honors.\nA new award was established in 2010, The Laurents/Hatcher Foundation Award. This is awarded annually \"for an un-produced, full-length play of social relevance by an emerging American playwright.\" The Laurents/Hatcher Foundation will give $50,000 to the writer with a grant of $100,000 towards production costs at a nonprofit theatre. The first award will be given in 2011."}

Lamo first gained media attention for breaking into several high-profile computer networks, including those of \"The New York Times\", Yahoo!, and Microsoft, culminating in his 2003 arrest.\nLamo was best known for reporting U.S. soldier Chelsea Manning to Army criminal investigators in 2010 for leaking hundreds of thousands of sensitive U.S. government documents to WikiLeaks. Lamo died on March 14, 2018 at the age of 37.\nEarly life and education.\nAdrian Lamo was born in Malden, Massachusetts near Boston. His father, Mario Ricardo Lamo, was Colombian. Adrian Lamo attended high schools in Bogot\u00e1 and San Francisco, from which he did not graduate, but received a GED and was court-ordered to take courses at American River College, a community college in Sacramento County, California. Lamo began his hacking efforts by hacking games on the Commodore 64 and through phone phreaking.\nActivities and legal issues.\nLamo first became known for operating AOL watchdog site \"Inside-AOL.com\".\nSecurity compromise.\nLamo was a grey hat hacker who viewed the rise of the World Wide Web with a mixture of excitement and alarm. He felt that others failed to see the importance of internet security in the early days of the World Wide Web. Lamo would break into corporate computer systems, but he never caused damage to the systems involved. Instead, he would offer to fix the security flaws free of charge, and if the flaw wasn't fixed, he would alert the media. Lamo hoped to be hired by a corporation to attempt to break in systems and test their security, a practice that came to be known as red teaming. However, by the time this practice was common, his felony conviction prevented him from being hired.\nIn December 2001, Lamo was praised by Worldcom for helping to fortify their corporate security. In February 2002, he broke into the internal computer network of \"The New York Times\", added his name to the internal database of expert sources, and used the paper's LexisNexis account to conduct research on high-profile subjects. \"The New York Times\" filed a complaint, and a warrant for Lamo's arrest was issued in August 2003 following a 15-month investigation by federal prosecutors in New York. At 10:15\u00a0a.m. on September 9, after spending a few days in hiding, he surrendered to the US Marshals in Sacramento, California. He re-surrendered to the FBI in New York City on September 11, and pleaded guilty to one felony count of computer crimes against Microsoft, LexisNexis, and \"The New York Times\" on January 8, 2004.\nIn July 2004, Lamo was sentenced to two years' probation, with six months to be served in home detention, and ordered to pay $65,000 in restitution. He was convicted of compromising security at \"The New York Times\", Microsoft, Yahoo!, and WorldCom.\nWhen challenged for a response to allegations that he was glamorizing crime for the sake of publicity, his response was: \"Anything I could say about my person or my actions would only cheapen what they have to say for themselves\". When approached for comment during his criminal case, Lamo frustrated reporters with non-sequiturs, such as \"Faith manages\" and \"It's a beautiful day.\"\nAt his sentencing, Lamo expressed remorse for harm he had caused by his intrusions. The court record quotes him as adding: \"I want to answer for what I have done and do better with my life.\"\nHe subsequently declared on the question-and-answer site Quora that: \"We all own our actions in fullness, not just the pleasant aspects of them.\" Lamo accepted that he had committed mistakes.\nDNA controversy.\nOn May 9, 2006, while 18 months into a two-year probation sentence, Lamo refused to give the United States government a blood sample, which they had demanded to record his DNA in their CODIS system. According to his attorney at the time Lamo had a religious objection to giving blood but was willing to give his DNA in another form. On June 15, 2007, lawyers for Lamo filed a motion citing the Book of Genesis as one basis for Lamo's religious opposition to the giving of blood.\nOn June 20, 2007, Lamo's legal counsel reached a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice whereby Lamo would submit a cheek swab in place of the blood sample.\nWikiLeaks and Chelsea Manning.\nIn February 2009, a partial list of the anonymous donors to the WikiLeaks website was leaked and published on the WikiLeaks website. Some media sources indicated at the time that Lamo was among the donors on the list. Lamo commented on his Twitter page, \"Thanks WikiLeaks, for leaking your donor list\u00a0... That's dedication.\"\nIn May 2010, Lamo reported to U.S. Army authorities that then Bradley Manning had claimed to have leaked a large body of classified documents, including 260,000 classified United States diplomatic cables. Lamo stated that Manning also \"took credit for leaking\" the video footage of the July 12, 2007, Baghdad airstrike, which has since come to be known as the \"Collateral Murder\" video.\nLamo stated, in an article written by Kevin Poulsen in \"Wired\" magazine, that he would not have turned Manning in \"if lives weren't in danger\u00a0... [Manning] was in a war zone and basically trying to vacuum up as much classified information as [she] could, and just throwing it up into the air.\" WikiLeaks responded by denouncing Lamo and Poulsen as \"notorious felons, informers &amp; manipulators\", and said: \"journalists should take care.\"\nAccording to Andy Greenberg of \"Forbes\", Lamo was a volunteer \"adversary characterization\" analyst for Project Vigilant, a Florida-based semi-secret government contractor, which encouraged him to inform the government about the alleged WikiLeaks source. The head of Project Vigilant, Chet Uber, claimed, \"I'm the one who called the U.S. government\u00a0... All the people who say that Adrian is a narc, he did a patriotic thing. He sees all kinds of hacks, and he was seriously worried about people dying.\"\nLamo was criticized by fellow hackers, such as those at the Hackers on Planet Earth conference in 2010, who labeled him a \"snitch\". Another commented to Lamo, following his speech during a panel discussion, saying: \"From my perspective, I see what you have done as treason.\"\nIn April 2011, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange called Lamo \"a very disreputable character\", and said it was not right to call him a financial contributor to WikiLeaks, since Lamo's monetary support amounted to only US$20 on one occasion. Assange said it was \"mischievous to suggest the individual has anything to do with WikiLeaks.\"\nLamo characterized his decision to work with the government as morally ambiguous, but objectively necessary, writing in \"The Guardian\": \"There were no right choices that day, only less wrong ones. It was cold, it was needful, and it was no one's to make except mine,\" adding to \"The Guardian\"s Ed Pilkington: \"There were hundreds of thousands of documents\u2014let's drop the number to 250,000 to be conservative\u2014and doing nothing meant gambling that each and every one would do no harm if no warning was given.\"\nThe Taliban insurgency later announced its intention to execute Afghan nationals named in the leaks as having cooperated with the U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan. By that time, the United States had received months of advance warning that their names were among the leaks. Manning was arrested and incarcerated in the U.S. military justice system and later sentenced to 35 years in confinement, which President Barack Obama at the end of his term commuted to a total of seven years, including time served. Lamo responded to the commutation with a post on Medium and an interview with \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\".\nGreenwald, Lamo, and \"Wired\" magazine.\nLamo's role in the Manning case drew criticism from Glenn Greenwald, who suggested that Lamo lied to Manning by turning Manning in, and then lied after the fact to cover up the circumstances of Manning's confessions. This drew a response from \"Wired\": \"At his most reasonable, Greenwald impugns our motives, attacks the character of our staff and carefully selects his facts and sources to misrepresent the truth and generate outrage in his readership.\" In an article about the Manning case, Greenwald mentioned \"Wired\" reporter Kevin Poulsen's 1994 felony conviction for computer hacking, suggesting that \"over the years, Poulsen has served more or less as Lamo's personal media voice.\" Greenwald was skeptical of an earlier story by Poulsen about Lamo's institutionalization on psychiatric grounds, writing: \"Lamo claimed he was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, a somewhat fashionable autism diagnosis which many stars in the computer world have also claimed.\" In an article entitled \"The Worsening Journalistic Disgrace at Wired\", Greenwald wrote that \"Wired\" was \"actively conceal[ing] from the public, for months on end, the key evidence [the full Lamo\u2013Manning chat logs] in a political story that has generated headlines around the world.\"\nOn July 13, 2011, \"Wired\" published the Lamo\u2013Manning chat logs in full, stating: \"The most significant of the unpublished details have now been publicly established with sufficient authority that we no longer believe any purpose is served by withholding the logs.\" Greenwald wrote of the newly released logs that in his opinion they validated his claim that \"Wired\" had concealed important evidence.\nCriticism of Anonymous.\nLamo had been critical of media coverage of the hacker collective Anonymous, saying that media outlets have over-hyped and mythologized the group. He also said that Anonymous is not the \"invulnerable\" group it is claimed to be, and he can see \"no rational point in what they're doing.\"\nFilm and television.\nOn August 22, 2002, Lamo was removed from a segment of \"NBC Nightly News\" when, after being asked to demonstrate his skills for the camera, he gained access to NBC's internal network. NBC was concerned that they broke the law by taping Lamo while he (possibly) broke the law. Lamo was a guest on \"The Screen Savers\" five times beginning in 2002.\n\"Hackers Wanted\", a documentary film focusing on Lamo's life as a hacker, was produced by Trigger Street Productions, and narrated by Kevin Spacey. Focusing on the 2003 hacking scene, the film features interviews with Kevin Rose and Steve Wozniak. The film has not been conventionally released. In May 2009, a video purporting to be a trailer for \"Hackers Wanted\" was allegedly leaked to or by the Internet film site Eye Crave. In May 2010, an earlier cut of the film was leaked via BitTorrent. According to an insider, what was leaked on the Internet was a very different film from the newer version, which includes additional footage. On June 12, 2010, a director's cut version of the film was also leaked onto torrent sites.\nLamo also appeared on \"Good Morning America\", Fox News, \"Democracy Now!\", \"Frontline\", and repeatedly on KCRA-TV News as an expert on netcentric crime and incidents. He was interviewed for the documentaries \"\" and \"True Stories: WikiLeaks \u2013 Secrets and Lies\".\nLamo reconnected with Leo Laporte in 2015 as a result of a Quora article on the \"dark web\" for an episode of \"The New Screen Savers\".\nLamo wrote the book \"Ask Adrian\", a collection of his best Q&amp;A drawn from over 500 pages of Quora answers, which have so far received nearly 30,000,000 views.\nPersonal life and death.\nLamo was known as the \"Homeless Hacker\" for his reportedly transient lifestyle, claiming that he spent much of his travels couch-surfing, squatting in abandoned buildings, and traveling to Internet caf\u00e9s, libraries, and universities to investigate networks, sometimes exploiting security holes. He usually preferred sleeping on couches, and when he did sleep on beds, he didn't sleep under covers. He would also often wander through homes and offices in the middle of the night, by the light of a flashlight.\nIn the mid-1990s, Lamo volunteered for the gay and lesbian media firm PlanetOut Inc. In 1998, Lamo was appointed to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer and Questioning Youth Task Force by the San Francisco Board of Supervisors.\nLamo used a wide variety of supplements and drugs throughout his life. His wife, Lauren Fisher, called his drug use \"body hacking\". One of Lamo's preferred supplements was kratom, which he used as a less-dangerous alternative to opioids. In 2001, he overdosed on prescription amphetamines. After he turned in Manning, his drug use escalated, but later claimed that he was in recovery.\nIn a 2004 interview with \"Wired\", an ex-girlfriend of Lamo's described him as \"very controlling\", alleging \"he carried a stun gun, which he used on me\". The same article claimed a court had issued a restraining order against Lamo; he disputed the claim, writing: \"I have never been subject to a restraining order in my life\".\nLamo said in a \"Wired\" article that, in May 2010, after he reported the theft of his backpack, an investigating officer noted unusual behavior and placed him under a 72-hour involuntary psychiatric hold, which was extended to a nine-day hold. Lamo said he was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome at the psychiatric ward.\nFor a period of time in March 2011, Lamo was allegedly \"in hiding\", claiming that his \"life was under threat\" after turning in Manning.\nLamo died on March 14, 2018, in Wichita, Kansas, at the age of 37. Nearly three months later, the Sedgwick County Regional Forensic Science Center reported that \"Despite a complete autopsy and supplemental testing, no definitive cause of death was identified.\" However, many bottles of pills were found in his home. Several of the pills found there were known to cause severe health problems when combined with kratom. As a result, evidence points to an accidental death due to drug abuse."}

The number of associate justices is eight, as set by the Judiciary Act of 1869.\nArticle II, Section 2, Clause 2 of the United States Constitution grants plenary power to the president to nominate, and with the advice and consent (confirmation) of the Senate, appoint justices to the Supreme Court. Article III, Section 1 of the Constitution effectively grants life tenure to associate justices, and all other federal judges, which ends only when a justice dies, retires, resigns, or is removed from office by impeachment.\nEach Supreme Court justice has a single vote in deciding the cases argued before it; the chief justice's vote counts no more than that of any other justice. However, the chief justice\u2014when in the majority\u2014decides who writes the court's opinion. Otherwise, the senior justice in the majority assigns the writing of a decision. Furthermore, the chief justice leads the discussion of the case among the justices. The chief justice has certain administrative responsibilities that the other justices do not and is paid slightly more ($270,700 per year as of 2019, as opposed to $258,900 per year for each associate justice).\nAssociate justices have seniority by order of appointment, although the chief justice is always considered to be the most senior. If two justices are appointed on the same day, the older is designated the senior justice of the two. Currently, the senior associate justice is Clarence Thomas. By tradition, when the justices are in conference deliberating the outcome of cases before the Supreme Court, the justices state their views in order of seniority. The senior associate justice is also tasked with carrying out the chief justice's duties when he is unable to, or if that office is vacant. Historically, associate justices were styled \"Mr. Justice\" in court opinions and other writings. The title was shortened to \"Justice\" in 1980, a year before Sandra Day O'Connor became the first female justice.\nCurrent associate justices.\nThere are currently eight associate justices on the Supreme Court, with the most recent appointment being that of Amy Coney Barrett, who was sworn in on October 27, 2020, succeeding Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The justices, ordered by seniority, are:\nRetired associate justices.\nAn associate justice who leaves the Supreme Court after attaining the age and meeting the service requirements prescribed by federal statute () may retire rather than resign. After retirement, they keep their title, and by custom may also keep a set of chambers in the Supreme Court building, and employ law clerks. The names of retired associate justices continue to appear alongside those of the active justices in the bound volumes of Supreme Court decisions. Federal statute () provides that retired Supreme Court justices may serve\u2014if designated and assigned by the chief justice\u2014on panels of the U.S. courts of appeals, or on the U.S. district courts. Retired justices are not, however, authorized to take part in the consideration or decision of any cases before the Supreme Court (unlike other retired federal judges who may be permitted to do so in their former courts); neither are they known or designated as a \"senior judge\". When, after his retirement, William O. Douglas attempted to take a more active role than was customary, maintaining that it was his prerogative to do so because of his senior status, he was rebuffed by Chief Justice Warren Burger and admonished by the whole Court.\nThere are three living retired associate justices: Sandra Day O'Connor, retired January 31, 2006; David Souter, retired June 29, 2009; and Anthony Kennedy, retired July 31, 2018. Souter regularly serves on panels of the First Circuit Courts of Appeals, while O'Connor also served on panels of various circuit courts for several years following her retirement and prior to her later withdrawal from public life; in contrast, Kennedy has not performed any judicial duties since retiring.\nList of associate justices.\nSince the Supreme Court was established in 1789, the following 103 persons have served as an associate justice:"}

{"id": "3010", "revid": "29463730", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3010", "title": "Alan Jay Lerner", "text": "Alan Jay Lerner (August 31, 1918 \u2013 June 14, 1986) was an American lyricist and librettist. In collaboration with Frederick Loewe, and later Burton Lane, he created some of the world's most popular and enduring works of musical theatre both for the stage and on film. He won three Tony Awards and three Academy Awards, among other honors.\nEarly life and education.\nBorn in New York City, he was the son of Edith Adelson Lerner and Joseph Jay Lerner, whose brother, Samuel Alexander Lerner, was founder and owner of the Lerner Stores, a chain of dress shops. One of Lerner's cousins was the radio comedian and television game show panelist Henry Morgan. Lerner was educated at Bedales School in England, The Choate School (now Choate Rosemary Hall) in Wallingford, Connecticut, (where he wrote \"The Choate Marching Song\") and Harvard. He attended both Camp Androscoggin and Camp Greylock. At both Choate and Harvard, Lerner was a classmate of John F. Kennedy; at Choate they had worked together on the yearbook staff. Like Cole Porter at Yale and Richard Rodgers at Columbia, his career in musical theater began with his collegiate contributions, in Lerner's case to the annual Harvard Hasty Pudding musicals. During the summers of 1936 and 1937, Lerner studied music composition at Juilliard. While attending Harvard, he lost his sight in his left eye due to an accident in the boxing ring. In 1957, Lerner and Leonard Bernstein, another of Lerner's college classmates, collaborated on \"Lonely Men of Harvard,\" a tongue-in-cheek salute to their alma mater.\nCareer.\nDue to his eye injury, Lerner could not serve in World War II. Instead he wrote radio scripts, including \"Your Hit Parade\", until he was introduced to Austrian composer Frederick Loewe, who needed a partner, in 1942 at the Lamb's Club. While at the Lamb's, he also met Lorenz Hart, with whom he would also collaborate.\nLerner and Loewe's first collaboration was a musical adaptation of Barry Conners's farce \"The Patsy\" called \"Life of the Party\" for a Detroit stock company. The lyrics were mostly written by Earle Crooker, but he had left the project, with the score needing vast improvement. It enjoyed a nine-week run and encouraged the duo to join forces with Arthur Pierson for \"What's Up?\", which opened on Broadway in 1943. It ran for 63 performances and was followed two years later by \"The Day Before Spring\".\nTheir first hit was \"Brigadoon\" (1947), a romantic fantasy set in a mystical Scottish village, directed by Robert Lewis. It was followed in 1951 by the Gold Rush story \"Paint Your Wagon\". While the show ran for nearly a year and included songs that later became pop standards, it was less successful than Lerner's previous work. He later said of \"Paint Your Wagon\", it was \"a success but not a hit.\"\nLerner worked with Kurt Weill on the stage musical \"Love Life\" (1948) and Burton Lane on the movie musical \"Royal Wedding\" (1951). In that same year Lerner also wrote the Oscar-winning original screenplay for \"An American in Paris\", produced by Arthur Freed and directed by Vincente Minnelli. This was the same team who would later join with Lerner and Loewe to create \"Gigi\".\nIn 1956, Lerner and Loewe unveiled \"My Fair Lady\". By this time, too, Lerner and Burton Lane were already working on a musical about Li'l Abner. Gabriel Pascal owned the rights to \"Pygmalion\", which had been unsuccessful with other composers who tried to adapt it into a musical. Arthur Schwartz and Howard Dietz first tried, and then Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II attempted, but gave up and Hammerstein told Lerner, \"\"Pygmalion\" had no subplot\". Lerner and Loewe's adaptation of George Bernard Shaw's \"Pygmalion\" retained his social commentary and added appropriate songs for the characters of Henry Higgins and Eliza Doolittle, played originally by Rex Harrison and Julie Andrews. It set box-office records in New York and London. When brought to the screen in 1964, the movie version won eight Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Actor for Rex Harrison.\nLerner and Loewe's run of success continued with their next project, a film adaptation of stories from Colette, the Academy Award-winning film musical \"Gigi\", starring Leslie Caron, Louis Jourdan and Maurice Chevalier. The film won all of its nine Oscar nominations, a record at that time, and a special Oscar for co-star Maurice Chevalier.\nThe Lerner-Loewe partnership cracked under the stress of producing the Arthurian \"Camelot\" in 1960, with Loewe resisting Lerner's desire to direct as well as write when original director Moss Hart suffered a heart attack in the last few months of rehearsals and died shortly after the show's premiere. Lerner was hospitalized with bleeding ulcers while Loewe continued to have heart troubles. \"Camelot\" was a hit nonetheless, and immediately following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, his widow told reporter Theodore H. White that JFK's administration reminded her of the \"one brief shining moment\" of Lerner and Loewe's \"Camelot\". As of the early 21st century, \"Camelot\" was still invoked to describe the idealism, romance, and tragedy of the Kennedy years.\nLoewe retired to Palm Springs, California, while Lerner went through a series of musicals\u2014some successful, some not\u2014with such composers as Andr\u00e9 Previn (\"Coco\"), John Barry (\"Lolita, My Love\"), Leonard Bernstein (\"1600 Pennsylvania Avenue\"), Burton Lane (\"Carmelina\") and Charles Strouse (\"Dance a Little Closer\", based on the film, \"Idiot's Delight\", nicknamed \"Close A Little Faster\" by Broadway humorists because it closed on opening night). Most biographers blame Lerner's professional decline on the lack of a strong director with whom Lerner could collaborate, as Neil Simon did with Mike Nichols or Stephen Sondheim with Harold Prince (Moss Hart, who had directed \"My Fair Lady,\" died shortly after \"Camelot\" opened). In 1965 Lerner collaborated again with Burton Lane on the musical \"On a Clear Day You Can See Forever\", which was adapted for film in 1970. At this time, Lerner was hired by film producer Arthur P. Jacobs to write a treatment for an upcoming film project, \"Doctor Dolittle\", but Lerner abrogated his contract after several non-productive months of non-communicative procrastination and was replaced with Leslie Bricusse. Lerner was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1971.\nIn 1973, Lerner coaxed Loewe out of retirement to augment the \"Gigi\" score for a musical stage adaptation. The following year they collaborated on a musical film version of \"The Little Prince\", based on the classic children's tale by Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. This film was a critical and box office failure, but it has gained a modern following.\nLerner's autobiography, \"The Street Where I Live\" (1978), was an account of three of his and Loewe's successful collaborations, \"My Fair Lady\", \"Gigi\", and \"Camelot\", along with personal information. In the last year of his life, he published \"The Musical Theatre: A Celebration\", a well-reviewed history of the theatre, with personal anecdotes and humor. The \"Los Angeles Times\" reviewer wrote: \"There are several reasons why this book makes a fine introduction to musical theater. One is that Lerner knows exactly what was new, and when and why...In \"The Musical Theatre,\" one is privy to the judgment of a man... who expresses his opinions in a forthright, warm and personal manner.\" A book of Lerner's lyrics entitled \"A Hymn To Him\", edited by a British writer Benny Green, was published in 1987.\nAt the time of Lerner's death, he had been working with Gerard Kenny and Kristi Kane in London on a musical version of the film \"My Man Godfrey\". He had also received an urgent call from Andrew Lloyd Webber, asking him to write the lyrics to \"The Phantom of the Opera\". He wrote \"Masquerade\", but he then informed Webber that he wanted to leave the project because he was losing his memory (he was suffering from metastatic lung cancer) and Charles Hart replaced him. He had turned down an invitation to write the English-language lyrics for the musical version of \"Les Mis\u00e9rables\".\nAfter Lerner's death, Paul Blake made a musical revue based on Lerner's lyrics and life entitled \"Almost Like Being In Love\", which featured music by Frederick Loewe, Burton Lane, Andr\u00e9 Previn, Charles Strouse, and Kurt Weill. The show ran for 10 days at the Herbst Theatre in San Francisco. \nSongwriting.\nLerner often struggled with writing his lyrics. He was uncharacteristically able to complete \"I Could Have Danced All Night\" from \"My Fair Lady\" in one 24-hour period. He usually spent months on each song and was constantly rewriting them. Lerner was said to have insecurity about his talent. He would sometimes write songs with someone in mind, for instance, \"I've Grown Accustomed To Her Face\" from \"My Fair Lady\" was written with Rex Harrison in mind to complement his very limited vocal range.\nLerner said of writing:\nIn a 1979 interview on NPR's \"All Things Considered\", Lerner went into some depth about his lyrics for \"My Fair Lady\". Professor Henry Higgins sings, \"Look at her, a prisoner of the gutters / Condemned by every syllable she utters / By right she should be taken out and hung / For the cold-blooded murder of the English tongue.\" Lerner said he knew the lyric used incorrect grammar for the sake of a rhyme. He was later approached about it by another lyricist:\nDramatists Guild.\nAlan Jay Lerner was an advocate for writers' rights in theatre. He was a member of the Dramatists Guild of America. In 1960, he was elected as the twelfth president of the non-profit organization. He continued to serve as the Guild's president until 1964.\nPersonal life.\nFor nearly twenty years, Lerner was addicted to amphetamines; during the 1960s he was a patient of Max Jacobson, known as \"Dr. Feelgood\", who administered injections of \"vitamins with enzymes\" that were in fact laced with amphetamines. Lerner's addiction is believed to have been the result of Jacobson's practice.\nMarriages and children.\nLerner married eight times: Ruth Boyd (1940\u20131947), singer Marion Bell (1947\u20131949), actress Nancy Olson (1950\u20131957), lawyer Micheline Muselli Pozzo di Borgo (1957\u20131965), editor Karen Gundersen (1966\u20131974), Sandra Payne (1974\u20131976), Nina Bushkin (1977\u20131981) and Liz Robertson (1981\u20131986 [his death]). Four of his eight wives \u2013 Olson, Payne, Bushkin, and Robertson \u2013 were actresses.\nHis seventh wife, Nina Bushkin, whom he married on May 30, 1977, was the director of development at Mannes College of Music and the daughter of composer and musician Joey Bushkin. After their divorce in 1981, Lerner was ordered to pay her a settlement of $50,000. Lerner wrote in his autobiography (as quoted by \"The New York Times\"): \"All I can say is that if I had no flair for marriage, I also had no flair for bachelorhood.\" One of his ex-wives reportedly said, \"Marriage is Alan's way of saying goodbye.\"\nLerner had four children: three daughters, Susan (by Boyd), Liza and Jennifer (by Olson); and one son, screenwriter and journalist Michael Alan Lerner (by di Borgo).\nLerner's multiple divorces cost him much of his wealth, but he was primarily responsible for his own financial ups and downs and was apparently less than truthful about his financial fecklessness. One persistent fiction, widely publicized, was that his divorce settlement from Micheline Muselli Pozzo di Borgo (his fourth wife) cost him an estimated $1 million in 1965. This was a gross distortion of the truth. Lerner's pattern of financial mismanagement continued until his death from cancer in 1986, when he reportedly owed the US Internal Revenue Service over US$1,000,000 in back taxes and was unable to pay for his final medical expenses.\nDeath.\nOn June 14, 1986, Lerner died of lung cancer in Manhattan at the age of 67. At the time of his death he was married to actress Liz Robertson, who was 36 years his junior. He lived in Center Island, New York. He has a memorial plaque in St Paul's Church, the Actors' Church in Covent Garden in London.\nWorks.\nFilms.\nSource: TCM"}

He also wrote the comic strips \"Abbie an' Slats\" (in the years 1937\u201345) and \"Long Sam\" (1954). He won the National Cartoonists Society's Reuben Award in 1947 for Cartoonist of the Year, and their 1979 Elzie Segar Award, posthumously for his \"unique and outstanding contribution to the profession of cartooning\". Comic strips dealt with urban experiences in the northern states of the USA until the year Capp introduced \"Li'l Abner\". Although Capp was from Connecticut, he spent 43 years teaching the world about Dogpatch, reaching an estimated 60 million readers in more than 900 American newspapers and 100 more papers in 28 countries internationally. M. Thomas Inge says Capp made a large personal fortune through the strip and \"had a profound influence on the way the world viewed the American South\".\nEarly life.\nBorn in New Haven, Connecticut, of East European Jewish heritage, Capp was the eldest child of Otto Philip Caplin (1885\u20131964) and Matilda (Davidson) Caplin (1884\u20131948). His brothers, Elliot and Jerome, were cartoonists, and his sister, Madeline, was a publicist. Capp's parents were both natives of Latvia whose families had migrated to New Haven in the 1880s. \"My mother and father had been brought to this country from Russia when they were infants\", wrote Capp in 1978. \"Their fathers had found that the great promise of America was true\u00a0\u2014 it was no crime to be a Jew.\" The Caplins were dirt-poor, and Capp later recalled stories of his mother going out in the night to sift through ash barrels for reusable bits of coal.\nIn August 1919, at the age of nine, Capp was run down by a trolley car and had his left leg amputated above the knee. According to his father Otto's unpublished autobiography, young Capp was not prepared for the amputation beforehand; having been in a coma for days, he suddenly awoke to discover that his leg had been removed. He was eventually given a prosthetic leg, but only learned to use it by adopting a slow way of walking which became increasingly painful as he grew older. The childhood tragedy of losing a leg likely helped shape Capp's cynical worldview, which was darker and more sardonic than that of the average newspaper cartoonist. \"I was indignant as hell about that leg\", he revealed in a November 1950 interview in \"Time\" magazine.\n\"The secret of how to live without resentment or embarrassment in a world in which I was different from everyone else\", Capp philosophically wrote (in \"Life magazine\" on May 23, 1960), \"was to be indifferent to that difference.\" The prevailing opinion among his friends was that Capp's Swiftian satire was, to some degree, a creatively channeled, compensatory response to his disability.\nCapp's father, a failed businessman and an amateur cartoonist, introduced him to drawing as a form of therapy. He became quite proficient, advancing mostly on his own. Among his earliest influences were \"Punch\" cartoonist\u2013illustrator Phil May, and American comic strip cartoonists Tad Dorgan, Cliff Sterrett, Rube Goldberg, Rudolph Dirks, Fred Opper, Billy DeBeck, George McManus, and Milt Gross. At about this same time, Capp became a voracious reader. According to Capp's brother Elliot, Alfred had finished all of Shakespeare and George Bernard Shaw by the time he turned 13. Among his childhood favorites were Dickens, Smollett, Mark Twain, Booth Tarkington, and later, Robert Benchley and S. J. Perelman.\nCapp spent five years at Bridgeport High School in Bridgeport, Connecticut, without receiving a diploma. He liked to joke about how he failed geometry for nine straight terms. His formal training came from a series of art schools in the New England area. Attending three of them in rapid succession, the impoverished Capp was thrown out of each for nonpayment of tuition\u2014the Boston Museum School of Fine Arts, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, and Designers Art School in Boston\u2014the last before launching his career. Capp already had decided to become a cartoonist. \"I heard that Bud Fisher (creator of \"Mutt and Jeff\") got $3,000 a week and was constantly marrying French countesses\", Capp said. \"I decided that was for me.\"\nIn early 1932, Capp hitchhiked to New York City. He lived in \"airless rat holes\" in Greenwich Village and turned out advertising strips at $2 each while scouring the city hunting for jobs. He eventually found work at the Associated Press when he was 23 years old. By March 1932, Capp was drawing \"Colonel Gilfeather\", a single-panel, AP-owned property created in 1930 by Dick Dorgan. Capp changed the focus and title to \"Mister Gilfeather\", but soon grew to hate the feature. He left the Associated Press in September 1932. Before leaving, he met Milton Caniff and the two became lifelong friends. Capp moved to Boston and married Catherine Wingate Cameron, whom he had met earlier in art class. She died in 2006 at the age of 96.\nLeaving his new wife with her parents in Amesbury, Massachusetts, he subsequently returned to New York in 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression. \"I was 23, I carried a mass of drawings, and I had nearly five dollars in my pocket. People were sleeping in alleys then, willing to work at anything.\" There he met Ham Fisher, who hired him to ghost on \"Joe Palooka\". During one of Fisher's extended vacations, Capp's \"Joe Palooka\" story arc introduced a stupid, coarse, oafish mountaineer named \"Big Leviticus,\" a crude prototype. (Leviticus was much closer to Capp's later villains Lem and Luke Scragg, than to the much more appealing and innocent Li'l Abner.)\nAlso during this period, Capp was working at night on samples for the strip that eventually became \"Li'l Abner\". He based his cast of characters on the authentic mountain-dwellers he met while hitchhiking through rural West Virginia and the Cumberland Valley as a teenager. (This was years before the Tennessee Valley Authority Act brought basic utilities such as electricity and running water to the region.) Leaving \"Joe Palooka\", Capp sold \"Li'l Abner\" to United Feature Syndicate (later known as United Media). The feature was launched on Monday, August 13, 1934, in eight North American newspapers\u2014including the \"New York Mirror\"\u2014and was an immediate success. Alfred G. Caplin eventually became \"Al Capp\" because the syndicate felt the original would not fit in a cartoon frame. Capp had his name changed legally in 1949.\nHis younger brother Elliot Caplin also became a comic strip writer, best known for co-creating the soap opera strip \"The Heart of Juliet Jones\" with artist Stan Drake and conceiving the comic strip character \"Broom-Hilda\" with cartoonist Russell Myers. Elliot also authored several off-Broadway plays, including \"A Nickel for Picasso\" (1981), which was based on and dedicated to his mother and his famous brother.\n\"Li'l Abner\".\nWhat began as a hillbilly burlesque soon evolved into one of the most imaginative, popular, and well-drawn strips of the twentieth century. Featuring vividly outlandish characters, bizarre situations, and equal parts suspense, slapstick, irony, satire, black humor, and biting social commentary, \"Li'l Abner\" is considered a classic of the genre. The comic strip stars Li'l Abner Yokum\u2014the simple-minded, loutish but good-natured, and eternally innocent hayseed who lives with his parents\u2014scrawny but superhuman Mammy Yokum, and shiftless, childlike Pappy Yokum.\n\"Yokum\" was a combination of \"yokel\" and \"hokum\", although Capp established a deeper meaning for the name during a series of visits around 1965\u20131970 with comics historians George E. Turner and Michael H. Price. \"It's phonetic Hebrew\u2014that's what it is, all right\u2014and that's what I was getting at with the name Yokum, more so than any attempt to sound \"hickish\"\", said Capp. \"That was a fortunate coincidence, of course, that the name should pack a backwoods connotation. But it's a godly conceit, really, playing off a godly name\u2014\"Joachim\" means 'God's determination', something like that\u2014that also happens to have a rustic ring to it.\"\nThe Yokums live in the backwater hamlet of Dogpatch, Kentucky. Described by its creator as \"an average stone-age community\", Dogpatch mostly consists of hopelessly ramshackle log cabins, pine trees, \"tarnip\" fields, and \"hawg\" wallows. Whatever energy Abner had went into evading the marital goals of Daisy Mae Scragg, his sexy, well-endowed (but virtuous) girlfriend\u2014until Capp finally gave in to reader pressure and allowed the couple to marry. This newsworthy event made the cover of \"Life\" on March 31, 1952.\nCapp peopled his comic strip with an assortment of memorable characters, including Marryin' Sam, Hairless Joe, Lonesome Polecat, Evil-Eye Fleegle, General Bullmoose, Lena the Hyena, Senator Jack S. Phogbound (Capp's caricature of the anti-New Deal Dixiecrats), the \"(shudder!)\" Scraggs, Available Jones, Nightmare Alice, Earthquake McGoon, and a host of others. Most notably, certainly from a G.I. point of view, are the beautiful, full-figured women such as Daisy Mae, Wolf Gal, Stupefyin' Jones, and Moonbeam McSwine (a caricature of his wife Catherine, aside from the dirt)\u2014all of whom found their way onto the painted noses of bomber planes during World War II and the Korean War. Perhaps Capp's most popular creations were the Shmoos, creatures whose incredible usefulness and generous nature made them a threat to civilization as we know it. Another famous character was Joe Btfsplk, who wants to be a loving friend, but is \"the world's worst jinx\", bringing bad luck to all those nearby. Btfsplk (his name is \"pronounced\" by simply blowing a \"raspberry\" or Bronx cheer) always has an iconic dark cloud over his head.\nDogpatch residents regularly combat the likes of city slickers, business tycoons, government officials, and intellectuals with their homespun simplicity. Situations often take the characters to other destinations, including New York City, Washington, D.C., Hollywood, tropical islands, the Moon, Mars, and some purely fanciful worlds of Capp's invention. The last includes El Passionato, Kigmyland, The Republic of Crumbumbo, Skunk Hollow, The Valley of the Shmoon, Planets Pincus Number 2 and 7, and a miserable frozen wasteland known as Lower Slobbovia, a pointedly political satire of backward nations and foreign diplomacy that remains a contemporary reference. \"Indeed, \"Li'l Abner\" incorporates such a panoply of characters and ideas that it defies summary\", according to cultural historian Anthony Harkins. \"Yet though Capp's storylines often wandered far afield, his hillbilly setting remained a central touchstone, serving both as a microcosm and a distorting carnival mirror of broader American society.\"\nThe strip's popularity grew from an original eight papers, to ultimately more than 900. At its peak, \"Li'l Abner\" was estimated to have been read daily in the United States by 60 to 70 million people (the U.S. population at the time was only 180 million), with adult readers far outnumbering children. Many communities, high schools and colleges staged Sadie Hawkins dances, patterned after the similar annual event in the strip.\nLi'l Abner has one odd design quirk that has puzzled readers for decades: the part in his hair always faces the viewer, no matter which direction Abner is facing. In response to the question \"Which side does Abner part his hair on?\", Capp would answer, \"Both.\" Capp said he finally found the right \"look\" for Li'l Abner with Henry Fonda's character Dave Tolliver, in \"The Trail of the Lonesome Pine\" (1936). In later years, Capp always claimed to have effectively created the miniskirt, when he first put one on Daisy Mae in 1934.\nParodies, toppers, and alternate strips.\n\"Li'l Abner\" also features a comic strip-within-the-strip: \"Fearless Fosdick\" is a parody of Chester Gould's \"Dick Tracy\". It first appeared in 1942, and proved so popular that it ran intermittently during the next 35 years. Gould was parodied personally in the series as cartoonist \"Lester Gooch\"\u2014the diminutive, much-harassed and occasionally deranged \"creator\" of Fosdick. The style of the \"Fosdick\" sequences closely mimicks \"Tracy\", including the urban setting, the outrageous villains, the galloping mortality rate, the crosshatched shadows, and even the lettering style. In 1952, Fosdick was the star of his own short-lived puppet show on NBC, featuring the Mary Chase marionettes.\nBesides \"Dick Tracy\", Capp parodied many other comic strips in \"Li'l Abner\"\u2014including \"Steve Canyon\", \"Superman\" (at least twice; first as \"Jack Jawbreaker\" in 1947, and again in 1966 as \"Chickensouperman\"), \"Mary Worth\" as \"Mary Worm\", \"Peanuts\" {with \"Peewee\" a parody of Charlie Brown with \"Croopy\" parody of Snoopy\" {1968} drawn by Bedley Damp a parody of Charles Schulz}, \"Rex Morgan, M.D.\", \"Little Annie Rooney\", and \"Little Orphan Annie\" (in which Punjab became \"Punjbag,\" an oleaginous slob). \"Fearless Fosdick\"\u2014and Capp's other spoofs such as \"Little Fanny Gooney\" (1952) and \"Jack Jawbreaker\"\u2014were almost certainly an early inspiration for Harvey Kurtzman's \"Mad Magazine\", which began in 1952 as a comic book that specifically parodied other comics in the same distinctive style and subversive manner.\nCapp also lampooned popular recording idols of the day, such as Elvis Presley (\"Hawg McCall\", 1957), Liberace (\"Loverboynik\", 1956), the Beatles (\"the Beasties\", 1964)\u2014and in 1944, Frank Sinatra. \"Sinatra was the first great public figure I ever wrote about,\" Capp once said. \"I called him 'Hal Fascinatra.' I remember my news syndicate was so worried about what his reaction might be, and we were all surprised when he telephoned and told me how thrilled he was with it. He always made it a point to send me a spent condom whenever he happened to see me in a restaurant...\" (from \"Frank Sinatra, My Father\" by Nancy Sinatra, 1985). On the other hand, Liberace was \"cut to the quick\" over Loverboynik, according to Capp, and even threatened legal action\u2014as would Joan Baez later, over \"Joanie Phoanie\" in 1967.\nCapp was just as likely to parody himself; his self-caricature made frequent, tongue-in-cheek appearances in \"Li'l Abner\". The gag was often at his own expense, as in the above 1951 sequence showing Capp's interaction with \"fans\" (see excerpt), or in his 1955 Disneyland parody, \"Hal Yappland\". Just about anything could be a target for Capp's satire\u2014in one storyline Li'l Abner is revealed to be the missing link between ape and man. In another, the search is on in Dogpatch for a pair of missing socks knitted by the first president of the United States.\nIn addition to creating \"Li'l Abner\", Capp also co-created two other newspaper strips: \"Abbie an' Slats\" with magazine illustrator Raeburn van Buren in 1937, and \"Long Sam\" with cartoonist Bob Lubbers in 1954, as well as the Sunday \"topper\" strips \"Washable Jones\", \"Small Fry\" (a.k.a. \"Small Change\"), and \"Advice fo' Chillun\".\nCritical recognition.\nAccording to comics historian Coulton Waugh, a 1947 poll of newspaper readers who claimed they ignored the comics page altogether revealed that many confessed to making a single exception: \"Li'l Abner\". \"When \"Li'l Abner\" made its debut in 1934, the vast majority of comic strips were designed chiefly to amuse or thrill their readers. Capp turned that world upside-down by routinely injecting politics and social commentary into \"Li'l Abner\". The strip was the first to regularly introduce characters and story lines having nothing to do with the nominal stars of the strip. The technique\u2014as invigorating as it was unorthodox\u2014was later adopted by cartoonists such as Walt Kelly [\"Pogo\"] and Garry Trudeau [\"Doonesbury\"]\", wrote comic strip historian Rick Marschall. According to Marschall, \"Li'l Abner\" gradually evolved into a broad satire of human nature. In his book \"America's Great Comic Strip Artists\" (1989), Marschall's analysis revealed a decidedly misanthropic subtext.\nOver the years, \"Li'l Abner\" has been adapted to radio, animated cartoons, stage production, motion pictures, and television. Capp has been compared, at various times, to Mark Twain, Dostoevski, Jonathan Swift, Lawrence Sterne, and Rabelais. Fans of the strip ranged from novelist John Steinbeck, who called Capp \"possibly the best writer in the world today\" in 1953, and even earnestly recommended him for the Nobel Prize in literature\u2014to media critic and theorist Marshall McLuhan, who considered Capp \"the only robust satirical force in American life\". John Updike, comparing Abner to a \"hillbilly Candide\", added that the strip's \"richness of social and philosophical commentary approached the Voltairean\". Charlie Chaplin, William F. Buckley, Al Hirschfeld, Harpo Marx, Russ Meyer, John Kenneth Galbraith, Ralph Bakshi, Shel Silverstein, Hugh Downs, Gene Shalit, Frank Cho, Daniel Clowes, and (reportedly) even Queen Elizabeth have confessed to being fans of \"Li'l Abner\".\n\"Li'l Abner\" was also the subject of the first book-length, scholarly assessment of an American comic strip ever published. \"Li'l Abner: A Study in American Satire\" by Arthur Asa Berger (Twayne, 1969) contained serious analyses of Capp's narrative technique, his use of dialogue, self-caricature, and grotesquerie, the place of \"Li'l Abner\" in American satire, and the significance of social criticism and the graphic image. \"One of the few strips ever taken seriously by students of American culture,\" wrote Professor Berger, \"\"Li'l Abner\" is worth studying ... because of Capp's imagination and artistry, and because of the strip's very obvious social relevance.\" It was reprinted by the University Press of Mississippi in 1994.\nThe 1940s and 1950s.\nDuring World War II and for many years afterward, Capp worked tirelessly going to hospitals to entertain patients, especially to cheer recent amputees and explain to them that the loss of a limb did not mean an end to a happy and productive life. Making no secret of his own disability, Capp openly joked about his prosthetic leg his whole life. In 1946, Capp created a special full-color comic book, \"Al Capp by Li'l Abner\", to be distributed by the Red Cross to encourage the thousands of amputee veterans returning from the war. Capp also was involved with the Sister Kenny Foundation, which pioneered new treatments for polio in the 1940s. Serving in his capacity as honorary chairman, Capp made public appearances on its behalf for years, contributed free artwork for its annual fundraising appeals, and entertained crippled and paraplegic children in children's hospitals with inspirational pep talks, humorous stories, and sketches.\nIn 1940, an RKO movie adaptation starred Granville Owen (later known as Jeff York) as Li'l Abner, with Buster Keaton taking the role of Lonesome Polecat, and featuring a title song with lyrics by Milton Berle. A successful musical comedy adaptation of the strip opened on Broadway at the St. James Theater on November 15, 1956, and had a long run of 693 performances, followed by a nationwide tour. The stage musical, with music and lyrics by Gene de Paul and Johnny Mercer, was adapted into a Technicolor motion picture at Paramount in 1959 by producer Norman Panama and director Melvin Frank, with a score by Nelson Riddle. Several performers repeated their Broadway roles in the film, most memorably Julie Newmar as Stupefyin' Jones and Stubby Kaye as Marryin' Sam.\nOther highlights of that decade included the 1942 debut of Fearless Fosdick as Abner's \"ideel\" (hero); the 1946 Lena the Hyena Contest, in which a hideous Lower Slobbovian gal was ultimately revealed in the harrowing winning entry (as judged by Frank Sinatra, Boris Karloff, and Salvador Dal\u00ed) drawn by noted cartoonist Basil Wolverton; and an ill-fated Sunday parody of \"Gone With the Wind\" that aroused anger and legal threats from author Margaret Mitchell, and led to a printed apology within the strip. In October 1947, Li'l Abner met Rockwell P. Squeezeblood, head of the abusive and corrupt Squeezeblood Comic Strip Syndicate. The resulting sequence, \"Jack Jawbreaker Fights Crime!\", was a devastating satire of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster's notorious exploitation by DC Comics over \"Superman\". It was later reprinted in \"The World of Li'l Abner\" (1953). (Siegel and Shuster had earlier poked fun at Capp in a \"Superman\" story in \"Action Comics #55\", December 1942, in which a cartoonist named \"Al Hatt\" invents a comic strip featuring the hillbilly \"Tiny Rufe\".)\nIn 1947, Capp earned a \"Newsweek\" cover story. That same year the \"New Yorker's\" profile on him was so long that it ran in consecutive issues. In 1948, Capp reached a creative peak with the introduction of the Shmoos, lovable and innocent fantasy creatures who reproduced at amazing speed and brought so many benefits that, ironically, the world economy was endangered. The much-copied storyline was a parable that was metaphorically interpreted in many different ways at the outset of the Cold War.\nFollowing his close friend Milton Caniff's lead (with \"Steve Canyon\"), Capp had recently fought a successful battle with the syndicate to gain complete ownership of his feature when the Shmoos debuted. As a result, he reaped enormous financial rewards from the unexpected (and almost unprecedented) merchandising phenomenon that followed. As in the strip, Shmoos suddenly appeared to be everywhere in 1949 and 1950\u2014including a \"Time\" cover story. A paperback collection of the original sequence, \"The Life and Times of the Shmoo\", became a bestseller for Simon &amp; Schuster. Shmoo dolls, clocks, watches, jewelry, earmuffs, wallpaper, fishing lures, air fresheners, soap, ice cream, balloons, ashtrays, comic books, records, sheet music, toys, games, Halloween masks, salt and pepper shakers, decals, pinbacks, tumblers, coin banks, greeting cards, planters, neckties, suspenders, belts, curtains, fountain pens, and other Shmoo paraphernalia were produced. A garment factory in Baltimore turned out a whole line of Shmoo apparel, including \"Shmooveralls\". The original sequence and its 1959 sequel, \"The Return of the Shmoo\", have been collected in print many times since, most recently in 2011, always to high sales figures. The Shmoos later had their own animated television series.\nCapp followed this success with other allegorical fantasy critters, including the aboriginal and masochistic \"Kigmies\", who craved abuse (a story that began as a veiled comment on racial and religious oppression), the dreaded \"Nogoodniks\" (or \"bad\" shmoos), and the irresistible \"Bald Iggle\", a guileless creature whose sad-eyed countenance compelled involuntary truthfulness\u2014with predictably disastrous results.\n\"Li'l Abner\" was censored for the first, but not the last time in September 1947, and was pulled from papers by Scripps-Howard. The controversy, as reported in \"Time\", centered on Capp's portrayal of the United States Senate. Edward Leech of Scripps said, \"We don't think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks\u00a0... boobs and undesirables.\" Capp criticized Senator Joseph McCarthy in 1954, calling him a \"poet\". \"He uses poetic license to try to create the beautifully ordered world of good guys and bad guys that he wants,\" said Capp. \"He seems at his best when terrifying the helpless and na\u00efve.\"\nCapp received the National Cartoonists Society's Billy DeBeck Memorial Award in 1947 for Cartoonist of the Year. (When the award name was changed in 1954, Capp also retroactively received a Reuben statuette.) He was an outspoken pioneer in favor of diversifying the NCS by admitting women cartoonists. Originally, the Society had disallowed female members. Capp briefly resigned his membership in 1949 to protest their refusal of admission to Hilda Terry, creator of the comic strip \"Teena\". According to Tom Roberts, author of \"Alex Raymond: His Life and Art\" (2007), Capp delivered a stirring speech that was instrumental in changing those rules. The NCS finally accepted female members the following year. In December 1952, Capp published an article in \"Real\" magazine entitled \"The REAL Powers in America\" that further challenged the conventional attitudes of the day: \"The real powers in America are \"women\"\u2014the wives and sweethearts behind the masculine dummies\u00a0...\"\nHighlights of the 1950s included the much-heralded marriage of Abner and Daisy Mae in 1952, the birth of their son \"Honest Abe\" Yokum in 1953, and in 1954, the introduction of Abner's enormous, long-lost kid brother Tiny Yokum, who filled Abner's place as a bachelor in the annual Sadie Hawkins Day race. In 1952, Capp and his characters graced the covers of both \"Life\" and \"TV Guide\". 1956 saw the debut of Bald Iggle, considered by some \"Abner\" enthusiasts to be the creative high point of the strip, as well as Mammy's revelatory encounter with the \"Square Eyes\" Family\u2014Capp's thinly-veiled appeal for racial tolerance. (This fable-like story was collected into an educational comic book called \"Mammy Yokum and the Great Dogpatch Mystery!\", and distributed by the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith later that year.) Two years later, Capp's studio issued \"Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story\", a biographical comic book distributed by the Fellowship of Reconciliation.\nOften, Capp had parodied corporate greed\u2014pork tycoon J. Roaringham Fatback had figured prominently in wiping out the Shmoos. But in 1952, when General Motors president Charles E. Wilson, nominated for a cabinet post, told Congress \"...\u00a0what was good for the country was good for General Motors and vice versa\", he inspired one of Capp's greatest satires\u2014the introduction of General Bullmoose, the robust, ruthless, and ageless business tycoon. The blustering Bullmoose, who seemed to own and control nearly everything, justified his far-reaching and mercenary excesses by saying \"What's good for General Bullmoose is good for \"everybody!\"\" Bullmoose's corrupt interests were often pitted against those of the pathetic Lower Slobbovians in a classic mismatch of \"haves\" versus \"have-nots\". This character, along with the Shmoos, helped cement Capp's favor with the Left, and increased their outrage a decade later when Capp, a former Franklin D. Roosevelt liberal, switched targets. Nonetheless, General Bullmoose continued to appear, undaunted and unredeemed, during the strip's final right-wing phase and into the 1970s.\nFeud with Ham Fisher.\nAfter Capp quit his ghosting job on Ham Fisher's \"Joe Palooka\" in 1934 to launch his own strip, Fisher badmouthed him to colleagues and editors, claiming that Capp had \"stolen\" his idea. For years, Fisher brought the characters back to his strip, billing them as \"The ORIGINAL Hillbilly Characters\" and advising readers not to be \"fooled by imitations\". (In fact, Fisher's brutish hillbilly character\u2014Big Leviticus, created by Capp in Fisher's absence\u2014bore little resemblance to Li'l Abner.) According to a November 1950 \"Time\" article, \"Capp parted from Fisher with a definite impression, (to put it mildly) that he had been underpaid and unappreciated. Fisher, a man of Roman self esteem, considered Capp an ingrate and a whippersnapper, and watched his rise to fame with unfeigned horror.\"\n\"Fisher repeatedly brought Leviticus and his clan back, claiming their primacy as comics' first hillbilly family\u00a0\u2014 but he was missing the point. It wasn't the setting that made Capp's strip such a huge success. It was Capp's finely tuned sense of the absurd, his ability to milk an outrageous situation for every laugh in it and then, impossibly, to squeeze even more laughs from it, that found such favor with the public,\" (from Don Markstein's \"Toonopedia\").\nThe Capp-Fisher feud was well known in cartooning circles, and it grew more personal as Capp's strip eclipsed \"Joe Palooka\" in popularity. Fisher hired away Capp's top assistant, Moe Leff. After Fisher underwent plastic surgery, Capp included a racehorse in \"Li'l Abner\" named \"Ham's Nose-Bob\". In 1950, Capp introduced a cartoonist character named \"Happy Vermin\"\u2014a caricature of Fisher\u2014who hired Abner to draw his comic strip in a dimly lit closet (after sacking his previous \"temporary\" assistant of 20 years, who had been cut off from all his friends in the process). Instead of using Vermin's tired characters, Abner inventively peopled the strip with hillbillies. A bighearted Vermin told his slaving assistant: \"I'm proud of having created these characters!! They'll make millions for me!! And if they do\u00a0\u2014 I'll get \"you\" a new light bulb!!\"\nTraveling in the same social circles, the two men engaged in a 20-year mutual vendetta, as described by the \"New York Daily News\" in 1998: \"They crossed paths often, in the midtown watering holes and at National Cartoonists Society banquets, and the city's gossip columns were full of their snarling public donnybrooks.\" In 1950, Capp wrote a nasty article for \"The Atlantic\", entitled \"I Remember Monster\". The article recounted Capp's days working for an unnamed \"benefactor\" with a miserly, swinish personality, who Capp claimed was a never-ending source of inspiration when it came time to create a new unregenerate villain for his comic strip. The thinly-veiled boss was understood to be Ham Fisher.\nFisher retaliated, doctoring photostats of \"Li'l Abner\" and falsely accusing Capp of sneaking obscenities into his comic strip. Fisher submitted examples of \"Li'l Abner\" to Capp's syndicate and to the New York courts, in which Fisher had identified pornographic images that were hidden in the background art. However, the X-rated material had been drawn there by Fisher. Capp was able to refute the accusation by simply showing the original artwork.\nIn 1954, when Capp was applying for a Boston television license, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) received an anonymous packet of pornographic \"Li'l Abner\" drawings. The National Cartoonists Society (NCS) convened an ethics hearing, and Fisher was expelled for the forgery from the same organization that he had helped found; Fisher's scheme had backfired in spectacular fashion. Around the same time, his mansion in Wisconsin was destroyed by a storm. On December 27, 1955, Fisher committed suicide in his studio. The feud and Fisher's suicide were used as the basis for a lurid, highly fictionalized murder mystery, \"Strip for Murder\" by Max Allan Collins.\nAnother \"feud\" seemed to be looming when, in one run of Sunday strips in 1957, Capp lampooned the comic strip \"Mary Worth\" as \"Mary Worm\". The title character was depicted as a nosy, interfering busybody. Allen Saunders, the creator of the \"Mary Worth\" strip, returned Capp's fire with the introduction of the character \"Hal Rapp\", a foul-tempered, ill-mannered, and (ironically) inebriated cartoonist, (Capp was a teetotaler). Later, the \"feud\" was revealed to be a collaborative hoax that Capp and his longtime pal Saunders had cooked up together. The Capp-Saunders \"feud\" fooled both editors and readers, generated plenty of free publicity for both strips\u2014and Capp and Saunders had a good laugh when all was revealed.\nPersonality.\nCapp is often associated with two other giants of the medium: Milton Caniff (\"Terry and the Pirates\", \"Steve Canyon\") and Walt Kelly (\"Pogo\"). The three cartoonists were close personal friends and professional associates throughout their adult lives, and occasionally, referenced each other in their strips. According to one anecdote (from \"Al Capp Remembered\", 1994), Capp and his brother Elliot ducked out of a dull party at Capp's home\u2014leaving Walt Kelly alone to fend for himself entertaining a group of Argentine envoys who didn't speak English. Kelly retaliated by giving away Capp's baby grand piano. According to Capp, who loved to relate the story, Kelly's two perfectly logical reasons for doing so were: a. to cement diplomatic relations between Argentina and the United States, and b. \"Because you can't play the piano, anyway!\" (\"Beetle Bailey\" creator Mort Walker confirmed the story, relating a slightly expanded version in his autobiography, \"Mort Walker's Private Scrapbook\", 2001.)\nMilton Caniff offered another anecdote (from \"Phi Beta Pogo\", 1989) involving Capp and Walt Kelly, \"two boys from Bridgeport, Connecticut, nose to nose,\" onstage at a meeting of the Newspaper Comics Council in the sixties. \"Walt would say to Al, 'Of course, Al, this is really how you should draw Daisy Mae, I'm only showing you this for your own good.' Then Walt would do a sketch. Capp, of course, got ticked off by this, as you can imagine! So he retaliated by doing \"his\" version of Pogo. Unfortunately, the drawings are long gone; no recording was made. What a shame! Nobody anticipated there'd be this dueling back and forth between the two of them\u00a0...\"\nAlthough he was often considered a difficult person, some acquaintances of Capp have stressed that the cartoonist also had a sensitive side. In 1973, when learning that the son of his political rival, Ted Kennedy, had his right leg amputated, Capp wrote the boy a letter of encouragement, giving candid advice as to how to deal with the loss of a limb, which he had experienced as a boy. One of Capp's grandchildren recalls that at one point, tears were streaming down the cartoonist's cheeks while he was watching a documentary about the Jonestown massacre. Also, it is reported that Capp gave money anonymously to charities and \"people in need\" at various points in his life.\nSexual misconduct claims.\nIn her autobiography, American actress Goldie Hawn stated that Capp sexually propositioned her on a casting couch and exposed himself to her when she was 19 years old. When she refused his advances, Capp became angry and told her that she was \"never gonna make anything in your life\" and that she should \"go and marry a Jewish dentist. You'll never get anywhere in this business.\"\nTwo biographies, one about Goldie Hawn and the other about Grace Kelly, describe Capp as trying to force Kelly into having sex with him, and he later tried to do the same with Hawn.\nIn 1971, investigative journalist Jack Anderson wrote that Capp had exposed his genitals to four female students at the University of Alabama. Then, after an incident at the University of Wisconsin\u2013Eau Claire, Capp was arrested. He pleaded guilty to a charge of attempted adultery, while charges of indecent exposure and sodomy were dropped. He was fined $500.\nProduction methods.\nLike many cartoonists, Capp made extensive use of assistants (notably Andy Amato, Harvey Curtis, Walter Johnson, and Frank Frazetta). During the extended peak of the strip, the workload grew to include advertising, merchandising, promotional work, public service comics, and other specialty work\u2014in addition to the regular six dailies and one Sunday strip per week. From the early 1940s to the late 1950s, there were scores of Sunday strip-style magazine ads for Cream of Wheat using the \"Abner\" characters, and in the 1950s, Fearless Fosdick became a spokesman for Wildroot Cream-Oil hair tonic in a series of daily strip-style print ads. The characters also sold chainsaws, underwear, ties, detergent, candy, soft drinks\u2014including a licensed version of Capp's moonshine creation, Kickapoo Joy Juice\u2014and General Electric and Procter &amp; Gamble products, all requiring special artwork.\nNo matter how much help he had, Capp insisted on his drawing and inking the characters' faces and hands\u2014especially of Abner and Daisy Mae\u2014and his distinctive touch is often discernible. \"He had \"the touch,\"\" Frazetta said of Capp in 2008. \"He knew how to take an otherwise ordinary drawing and really make it \"pop\". I'll never knock his talent.\"\nAs is usual with collaborative efforts in comic strips, his name was the only one credited\u2014 although, sensitive to his own experience working on \"Joe Palooka\", Capp frequently drew attention to his assistants in interviews and publicity pieces. A 1950 cover story in \"Time\" even included photographs of two of his employees, whose roles in the production were detailed by Capp. Ironically, this highly irregular policy (along with the subsequent fame of Frank Frazetta) has led to the misconception that his strip was \"ghosted\" by other hands. The production of \"Li'l Abner\" has been well documented, however. In point of fact, Capp maintained creative control over every stage of production for virtually the entire run of the strip. Capp originated the stories, wrote the dialogue, designed the major characters, rough penciled the preliminary staging and action of each panel, oversaw the finished pencils, and drew and inked the hands and faces of the characters. Frazetta authority David Winiewicz described the everyday working mode of operation in \"Li'l Abner Dailies: 1954 Volume 20\" (Kitchen Sink, 1994):\nThere was also a separate line of comic book titles published by the Caplin family-owned Toby Press, including \"Shmoo Comics\" featuring Washable Jones. Cartoonist Mell Lazarus, creator of \"Miss Peach\" and \"Momma\", wrote a comic novel in 1963 entitled \"The Boss Is Crazy, Too\" which was partly inspired by his apprenticeship days working with Capp and his brother Elliot at Toby. In a seminar at the Charles Schulz Museum on November 8, 2008, Lazarus called his experience at Toby \"the five funniest years of my life\". Lazarus went on to cite Capp as one of the \"four essentials\" in the field of newspaper cartoonists, along with Walt Kelly, Charles Schulz, and Milton Caniff.\nCapp detailed his approach to writing and drawing the stories in an instructional course book for the Famous Artists School, beginning in 1956. In 1959, Capp recorded and released an album for Folkways Records (now owned by the Smithsonian) on which he identified and described \"The Mechanics of the Comic Strip\".\nFrazetta, later famous as a fantasy artist, assisted on the strip from 1954 to December 1961. Fascinated by Frazetta's abilities, Capp initially gave him a free hand in an extended daily sequence (about a biker named \"Frankie,\" a caricature of Frazetta) to experiment with the basic look of the strip by adding a bit more realism and detail (particularly to the inking). After editors complained about the stylistic changes, the strip's previous look was restored. During most of his tenure with Capp, Frazetta's primary responsibility\u2014along with various specialty art, such as a series of \"Li'l Abner\" greeting cards\u2014was tight-penciling the Sunday pages from studio roughs. This work was collected by Dark Horse Comics in a four-volume hardcover series entitled \"Al Capp's Li'l Abner: The Frazetta Years\". In 1961, Capp, complaining of declining revenue, wanted to have Frazetta continue with a 50% pay cut. \"[Capp] said he would cut the salary in half. Goodbye. That was that. \"I\" said goodbye,\" (from \"Frazetta: Painting with Fire\"). However, Frazetta returned briefly a few years later to draw a public service comic book called \"Li'l Abner and the Creatures from Drop-Outer Space\", distributed by the Job Corps in 1965.\nPublic service works.\nCapp provided specialty artwork for civic groups, government agencies, and charitable or nonprofit organizations, spanning several decades. The following titles are all single-issue, educational comic books and pamphlets produced for various public services:\nIn addition, Dogpatch characters were used in national campaigns for the U.S. Treasury, the Cancer Foundation, the March of Dimes, the National Heart Fund, the Sister Kenny Foundation, the Boy Scouts of America, Community Chest, the National Reading Council, Minnesota Tuberculosis and Health Association, Christmas Seals, the National Amputation Foundation, and Disabled American Veterans, among others.\nPublic figure.\nIn the Golden Age of the American comic strip, successful cartoonists received a great deal of attention; their professional and private lives were reported in the press, and their celebrity was often nearly sufficient to rival their creations. As \"Li'l Abner\" reached its peak years, and following the success of the Shmoos and other high moments in his work, Al Capp achieved a public profile that is still unparalleled in his profession, and arguably exceeded the fame of his strip. \"Capp was the best known, most influential and most controversial cartoonist of his era,\" writes publisher (and leading Shmoo collector) Denis Kitchen. \"His personal celebrity transcended comics, reaching the public and influencing the culture in a variety of media. For many years he simultaneously produced the daily strip, a weekly syndicated newspaper column, and a 500-station radio program...\" He ran the Boston Summer Theatre with \"The Phantom\" cartoonist Lee Falk, bringing in Hollywood actors such as Mae West, Melvyn Douglas, and Claude Rains to star in their live productions. He even briefly considered running for a Massachusetts Senate seat. Vice President Spiro Agnew urged Capp to run in the Democratic Party Massachusetts primary in 1970 against Ted Kennedy, but Capp ultimately declined. (He did, however, donate his services as a speaker at a $100-a-plate fundraiser for Republican Congressman Jack Kemp.)\nBesides his use of the comic strip to voice his opinions and display his humor, Capp was a popular guest speaker at universities, and on radio and television. He remains the only cartoonist to be embraced by television; no other comic artist to date has come close to Capp's televised exposure. Capp appeared as a regular on \"The Author Meets the Critics\" (1948\u2013'54) and made regular, weekly appearances on \"Today\" in 1953. He was also a periodic panelist on ABC and NBC's \"Who Said That?\" (1948\u2013'55), and co-hosted DuMont's \"What's the Story?\" (1953). Between 1952 and 1972, he hosted at least \"five\" television shows\u2013three different talk shows called \"The Al Capp Show\" (1952 and 1968) and \"Al Capp\" (1971\u2013'72), \"Al Capp's America\" (a live \"chalk talk,\" with Capp providing a barbed commentary while sketching cartoons, 1954), and a CBS game show called \"Anyone Can Win\" (1953). He also hosted similar vehicles on the radio\u2014and was a familiar celebrity guest on various other broadcast programs, including NBC Radio's long-running \"Monitor\" with its famous \"Monitor\" Beacon audio signature, as a commentator dubbed \"An expert of nothing with opinions on everything.\"\nHis frequent appearances on NBC's \"The Tonight Show\" spanned three emcees (Steve Allen, Jack Paar, and Johnny Carson), from the 1950s to the 1970s. One memorable story, as recounted to Johnny Carson, was about his meeting with then-President Dwight D. Eisenhower. As Capp was ushered into the Oval Office, his prosthetic leg suddenly collapsed into a pile of disengaged parts and hinges on the floor. The President immediately turned to an aide and said, \"Call Walter Reed (Hospital), or maybe Bethesda,\" to which Capp replied, \"Hell no, just call a good local mechanic!\" (Capp also spoofed Carson in his strip, in a 1970 episode called \"The Tommy Wholesome Show\".)\nCapp portrayed himself in a cameo role in the Bob Hope film \"That Certain Feeling\", for which he also provided promotional art. He was interviewed live on \"Person to Person\" on November 27, 1959, by host Charles Collingwood. He also appeared as himself on \"The Ed Sullivan Show\", Sid Caesar's \"Your Show of Shows\", \"The Red Skelton Show\", \"The Merv Griffin Show\", \"The Mike Douglas Show\", and guested on Ralph Edwards' \"This Is Your Life\" on February 12, 1961, with honoree Peter Palmer. Capp also freelanced very successfully as a magazine writer and newspaper columnist, in a wide variety of publications including \"Life\", \"Show\", \"Pageant\", \"The Atlantic\", \"Esquire\", \"Coronet\", and \"The Saturday Evening Post\". Capp was impersonated by comedians Rich Little and David Frye. Although Capp's endorsement activities never rivaled Li'l Abner's or Fearless Fosdick's, he was a celebrity spokesman in print ads for Sheaffer Snorkel fountain pens (along with colleagues and close friends Milton Caniff and Walt Kelly), and\u2014with an irony that became apparent later\u2014a brand of cigarettes (Chesterfield).\nCapp resumed visiting war amputees during the Korean War and Vietnam War. He toured Vietnam with the USO, entertaining troops along with Art Buchwald and George Plimpton. He served as chairman of the Cartoonists' Committee in President Dwight D. Eisenhower's People-to-People program in 1954 (although Capp had supported Adlai Stevenson for president in 1952 and 1956), which was organized to promote Savings bonds for the U.S. Treasury. Capp had earlier provided the Shmoo for a special Children's Savings Bond in 1949, accompanying President Harry S. Truman at the bond's unveiling ceremony. During the Soviet Union's blockade of West Berlin in 1948, the commanders of the Berlin airlift had cabled Capp, requesting inflatable shmoos as part of \"Operation: Little Vittles\". Candy-filled shmoos were air-dropped to hungry West Berliners by America's 17th Military Airport Squadron during the humanitarian effort. \"When the candy-chocked shmoos were dropped, a near-riot resulted,\" (reported in \"Newsweek\"\u2014October 11, 1948).\nIn addition to his public service work for charitable organizations for the handicapped, Capp also served on the National Reading Council, which was organized to combat illiteracy. He published a column (\"Wrong Turn Onto Sesame Street\") challenging federally funded public television endowments in favor of educational comics\u2014which, according to Capp, \"didn't cost a dime in taxes and never had. I pointed out that a kid could enjoy \"Sesame Street\" \"without\" learning how to read, but he couldn't enjoy comic strips \"unless\" he could read; and that a smaller investment in getting kids to read by supplying them with educational matter in such \"reading\" form might make better sense.\"\nCapp's academic interests included being one of nineteen original \"Trustees and Advisors\" for \"Endicott, Junior College for Young Woman\", located in Pride's Crossing (Beverly), Massachusetts, which was founded in 1939. Al Capp is listed in the 1942 Mingotide Yearbook, representing the first graduating class from Endicott Junior College. The yearbook entry includes his credential as a \"Cartoonist for United Feature Syndicate\" and a resident of New York City.\n\"Comics,\" wrote Capp in 1970, \"can be a combination of the highest quality of art and text, and many of them are.\" Capp produced many giveaway educational comic books and public services pamphlets, spanning several decades, for the Red Cross, the Department of Civil Defense, the Department of the Navy, the U.S. Army, the Anti-Defamation League, the Department of Labor, Community Chest (a forerunner of United Way), and the Job Corps. Capp's studio provided special artwork for various civic groups and nonprofit organizations as well. Dogpatch characters were used in national campaigns for the Cancer Foundation, the March of Dimes, the National Heart Fund, the Boy Scouts of America, Minnesota Tuberculosis and Health Association, the National Amputation Foundation, and Disabled American Veterans, among others. They were also used to help sell Christmas Seals.\nIn the early 1960s, Capp regularly wrote a column entitled \"Al Capp's Column\" for the newspaper \"The Schenectady Gazette\" (currently \"The Daily Gazette\"). He was the \"Playboy\" interview subject in December 1965, in a conversation conducted by Alvin Toffler. In August 1967, Capp was the narrator and host of an ABC network special called \"Do Blondes Have More Fun?\" In 1970, he was the subject of a provocative NBC documentary called \"This Is Al Capp\".\nThe 1960s and 1970s.\nCapp and his family lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, near Harvard during the entire Vietnam War protest era. The turmoil that Americans were watching on their television sets was happening live\u2014right in his own neighborhood. Campus radicals and \"hippies\" inevitably became one of Capp's favorite targets in the sixties. Alongside his long-established caricatures of right-wing, big business types such as General Bullmoose and J. Roaringham Fatback, Capp began spoofing counterculture icons such as Joan Baez (in the character of Joanie Phoanie, a wealthy folksinger who offers an impoverished orphanage ten thousand dollars' worth of \"protest songs\"). The sequence implicitly labeled Baez a limousine liberal, a charge she took to heart, as detailed years later in her 1987 autobiography, \"And A Voice To Sing With: A Memoir\". Another target was Senator Ted Kennedy, parodied as \"Senator O. Noble McGesture\", resident of \"Hyideelsport\". The town name is a play on Hyannisport, Massachusetts, where a number of the Kennedy clan have lived.\nCapp became a popular public speaker on college campuses, where he reportedly relished hecklers. He attacked militant antiwar demonstrators, both in his personal appearances and in his strip. He also satirized student political groups. The Youth International Party (YIP) and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) emerged in \"Li'l Abner\" as \"Students Wildly Indignant about Nearly Everything!\" (SWINE). In an April 1969 letter to \"Time\", Capp insisted, \"The students I blast are not the dissenters, but the destroyers\u2014the less than 4% who lock up deans in washrooms, who burn manuscripts of unpublished books, who make combination pigpens and playpens of their universities. The remaining 96% detest them as heartily as I do.\"\nCapp's increasingly controversial remarks at his campus speeches and during television appearances cost him his semi-regular spot on the \"Tonight Show\". His contentious public persona during this period was captured on a late sixties comedy LP called \"Al Capp On Campus\". The album features his interaction with students at Fresno State College (now California State University, Fresno) on such topics as \"sensitivity training,\" \"humanitarianism,\" \"abstract art\" (Capp hated it), and \"student protest\". The cover features a cartoon drawing by Capp of wildly dressed, angry hippies carrying protest signs with slogans like \"End Capp Brutality\", \"Abner and Daisy Mae Smoke Pot\", \"Capp Is Over [30, 40, 50\u2014all crossed out] the Hill!!\", and \"If You Like Crap, You'll Like Capp!\"\nHighlights of the strip's final decades include \"Boomchik\" (1961), in which America's international prestige is saved by Mammy Yokum, \"Daisy Mae Steps Out\" (1966), a female-empowering tale of Daisy's brazenly audacious \"homewrecker gland\", \"The Lips of Marcia Perkins\" (1967), a satirical, thinly-veiled commentary on venereal disease and public health warnings, \"Ignoble Savages\" (1968), in which the Mob takes over Harvard, and \"Corporal Crock\" (1973), in which Bullmoose reveals his reactionary cartoon role model, in a tale of obsession and the fanatical world of comic book collecting.\nThe cartoonist visited John Lennon and Yoko Ono at their 1969 Bed-In for Peace in Montreal, and their testy exchange later appeared in the documentary film ' (1988). Introducing himself with the words \"I'm a dreadful Neanderthal fascist. How do you do?\", Capp sardonically congratulated Lennon and Ono on their ' nude album cover: \"I think that everybody owes it to the world to prove they have pubic hair. You've done it, and I tell you that I applaud you for it.\" Following this exchange, Capp insulted Ono (\"Good God, you've gotta live with that?\"), and was asked to \"get out\" by Lennon publicist Derek Taylor. Lennon allowed him to stay, however, but the conversation had soured considerably. On Capp's exit, Lennon sang an impromptu version of his song \"The Ballad of John and Yoko\" with a slightly revised, but nonetheless prophetic lyric: \"Christ, you know it ain't easy / You know how hard it can be / The way things are goin' / They're gonna crucify \"Capp!\" \"\nDespite his political conservatism in the last decade of his life, Capp is reported to have been liberal in some particular causes; he supported gay rights, and did not tolerate any attempts at homophobic jokes. He is also said to have supported Martin Luther King Jr. and the fight for racial equality in American society, although he was very sceptical of the tactics of the Black Panthers and Malcolm X.\nIn 1968, a theme park called Dogpatch USA opened at Marble Falls, Arkansas, based on Capp's work and with his support. The park was a popular attraction during the 1970s, but was abandoned in 1993 due to financial difficulties. By 2005, the area once devoted to a live-action facsimile of Dogpatch (including a lifesize statue in the town square of Dogpatch \"founder\" General Jubilation T. Cornpone) had been heavily stripped by vandals and souvenir hunters, and was slowly being reclaimed by the surrounding Arkansas wilderness.\nOn April 22, 1971, syndicated columnist Jack Anderson reported allegations that in February 1968 Capp had made indecent advances to four female students when he was invited to speak at the University of Alabama. Anderson and an associate confirmed that Capp was shown out of town by university police, but that the incident had been hushed up by the university to avoid negative publicity.\nThe following month, Capp was charged in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, in connection with another alleged incident following his April 1 lecture at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire. Capp was accused of propositioning a married woman in his hotel room. Although no sexual act was alleged to have resulted, the original charge included \"sodomy\". As part of a plea agreement, Capp pleaded guilty to the charge of \"attempted adultery\" (adultery was a felony in Wisconsin) and the other charges were dropped. Capp was fined $500 and court costs. In a December 1992 article for \"The New Yorker,\" Seymour Hersh reported that President Richard Nixon and Charles Colson had repeatedly discussed the Capp case in Oval Office recordings that had recently been made available by the National Archives. Nixon and Capp were on friendly terms, Hersh wrote, and Nixon and Colson had worked to find a way for Capp to run against Ted Kennedy for the U.S. Senate. \"Nixon was worried about the allegations, fearing that Capp's very close links to the White House would become embarrassingly public\", Hersh wrote. \"The White House tapes and documents show that he and Colson discussed the issue repeatedly, and that Colson eventually reassured the president by saying that he had, in essence, fixed the case. Specifically, the president was told that one of Colson's people had gone to Wisconsin and tried to talk to the prosecutors.\" Colson's efforts failed, however. The Eau Claire district attorney, a Republican, refused to dismiss the attempted adultery charge. In passing sentence in February 1972, the judge rejected the D.A.'s motion that Capp agree to undergo psychiatric treatment.\nThe resulting publicity led to hundreds of papers dropping his comic strip, and Capp, already in failing health, withdrew from public speaking. Celebrity biographer James Spada has claimed that similar allegations were made by actress Grace Kelly. However, no firsthand allegation has ever surfaced.\n\"From beginning to end, Capp was acid-tongued toward the targets of his wit, intolerant of hypocrisy, and always wickedly funny. After about 40 years, however, Capp's interest in \"Abner\" waned, and this showed in the strip itself,\" according to Don Markstein's \"Toonopedia\". On November 13, 1977, Capp retired with an apology to his fans for the recently declining quality of the strip, which he said had been the best he could manage due to declining health. \"If you have any sense of humor about your strip\u2014and I had a sense of humor about mine\u2014you knew that for three or four years \"Abner\" was wrong. Oh hell, it's like a fighter retiring. I stayed on longer than I should have,\" he admitted, adding that he couldn't breathe anymore. \"When he retired \"Li'l Abner\", newspapers ran expansive articles and television commentators talked about the passing of an era. \"People magazine\" ran a substantial feature, and even the comics-free \"New York Times\" devoted nearly a full page to the event\", wrote publisher Denis Kitchen.\nCapp's final years were marked by advancing illness and by family tragedy. In October 1977, one of his two daughters died; a few weeks later, a beloved granddaughter was killed in a car accident. A lifelong chain smoker, Capp died in 1979 from emphysema at his home in South Hampton, New Hampshire. Capp is buried in Mount Prospect Cemetery in Amesbury, Massachusetts. Engraved on his headstone is a stanza from Thomas Gray: \"The plowman homeward plods his weary way / And leaves the world to darkness and to me\" (from \"Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard\", 1751).\nLegacy.\n\"Neither the strip's shifting political leanings nor the slide of its final few years had any bearing on its status as a classic; and in 1995, it was recognized as such by the U.S. Postal Service\", according to \"Toonopedia\". \"Li'l Abner\" was one of 20 American comic strips included in the Comic Strip Classics series of USPS commemorative stamps. Al Capp, an inductee into the National Cartoon Museum (formerly the International Museum of Cartoon Art), is one of only 31 artists selected to their Hall of Fame. Capp was also inducted into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 2004.\nSadie Hawkins Day and double whammy are two terms attributed to Al Capp that have entered the English language. Other, less ubiquitous Cappisms include skunk works and Lower Slobbovia. The term shmoo also has entered the lexicon, defining highly technical concepts in no fewer than \"four\" separate fields of science, including the variations shmooing (a microbiological term for the \"budding\" process in yeast reproduction), and shmoo plot (a technical term in the field of electrical engineering). In socioeconomics, a \"shmoo\" refers to any generic kind of good that reproduces itself, (as opposed to \"widgets\" which require resources and active production). In the field of particle physics, \"shmoo\" refers to a high energy survey instrument, as used at the Los Alamos National Laboratory to capture subatomic cosmic ray particles emitted from the Cygnus X-3 constellation. Capp also had a knack for popularizing certain uncommon terms, such as druthers, schmooze, and nogoodnik, neatnik, etc. In his book \"The American Language\", H.L. Mencken credits the postwar mania for adding \"-nik\" to the ends of adjectives to create nouns as beginning\u2014not with beatnik or Sputnik\u2014but earlier, in the pages of \"Li'l Abner\".\nAl Capp's life and career are the subjects of a new life-sized mural commemorating the 100th anniversary of his birth. Created by resident artist Jon P. Mooers, the mural was unveiled in downtown Amesbury on May 15, 2010. According to the \"Boston Globe\" (as reported on May 18, 2010), the town has renamed its amphitheater in the artist's honor, and is looking to develop an Al Capp Museum. Capp is also the subject of an upcoming WNET-TV \"American Masters\" documentary, \"The Life and Times of Al Capp\", produced by his granddaughter, independent filmmaker Caitlin Manning.\nSince his death in 1979, Al Capp and his work have been the subject of more than 40 books, including three biographies. Underground cartoonist and \"Li'l Abner\" expert Denis Kitchen has published, co-published, edited, or otherwise served as consultant on nearly all of them. Kitchen is currently compiling a biographical monograph on Al Capp.\nAt the San Diego Comic Con in July 2009, IDW announced the upcoming publication of \"Al Capp's Li'l Abner: The Complete Dailies and Color Sundays\" as part of their ongoing The Library of American Comics series. The comprehensive series, a reprinting of the entire 43-year history of \"Li'l Abner\", spanning a projected 20 volumes, began on April 7, 2010."}

She co-wrote the 1980 PBS documentary series ', hosted by Carl Sagan, whom she married in 1981. She is the creator, producer, and writer of the 2014 sequel, ' and its sequel series, \"\", as well as the book of the same name. She is credited with directing episodes of both series as well.\nShe was the Creative Director of NASA's Voyager Interstellar Message Project, the golden discs affixed to both the \"Voyager\u00a01\" and \"Voyager\u00a02\" spacecraft. Druyan's role on the project was discussed on the July 8, 2018 60 Minutes segment \"The Little Spacecraft That Could\". In the segment, Druyan explained her insistence that Chuck Berry's \"Johnny B. Goode\" be included on the Golden Record, saying: \"...\"Johnny B. Goode\", rock and roll, was the music of motion, of moving, getting to someplace you've never been before, and the odds are against you, but you want to go. That was Voyager.\" The segment also discussed Sagan's suggestion, in 1990, that Voyager\u00a01 turn its cameras back towards Earth to take a series of photographs showing the planets of our solar system. The shots, showing Earth from a distance of 3.7 billion miles as a small point of bluish light, became the basis for Sagan's famous \"Pale Blue Dot\" passage, first published in \"\" (1994).\nDruyan and Sagan's working and resulting romantic relationship has been the subject of numerous treatments in popular culture, including the Radiolab episode \"Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan's Ultimate Mix Tape\" and a segment of the Comedy Central program \"Drunk History\"s episode \"Space\". The asteroid 4970 Druyan, which is in a companion orbit with asteroid 2709 Sagan named after Druyan's late husband, is named after Druyan. In 2015, it was announced that Warner Brothers was in development on a drama about Sagan and Druyan's relationship, to be produced by producer Lynda Obst and Druyan.\nEarly life.\nDruyan was born in Queens, New York, the daughter of Pearl A. () and Harry Druyan, who co-owned a knitwear firm. Druyan's early interest in math and science was, in her word, \"derailed\" when a junior high-school teacher ridiculed a question she asked about the universality of . \"I raised my hand and said, 'You mean this applies to every circle in the universe?', and the teacher told me not to ask stupid questions. And there I was having this religious experience, and she made me feel like such a fool. I was completely flummoxed from then on until after college.\" Druyan characterized her three years at New York University as \"disastrous\", and it was only after she left school without graduating that she discovered the pre-Socratic philosophers and began educating herself, thus leading to a renewed interest in science.\nCareer as an author.\nDruyan's first novel, \"A Famous Broken Heart\", was published in 1977.\nDruyan co-wrote six \"New York Times\" best-sellers with Carl Sagan, including: \"Comet\", \"Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors\", and \"The Demon-Haunted World\". She is co-author, along with Carl Sagan, F. D. Drake, Timothy Ferris, Jon Lomberg and Linda Salzman Sagan, of \"Murmurs Of Earth: The Voyager Interstellar Record\". She also wrote the updated introduction to Sagan's book \"The Cosmic Connection\" and the epilogue of \"Billions and Billions\". She wrote the introduction to, and edited \"The Varieties of Scientific Experience\", published from Sagan's 1985 Gifford lectures.\nIn February 2020, Druyan published \"Cosmos: Possible Worlds\", a companion volume to , which premiered in March 2020.\nWork in science.\nAs creative director of NASA's Voyager Interstellar Message Project, Druyan worked with a team to design a complex message, including music and images, for possible alien civilizations. These golden phonograph records affixed to the \"Voyager\u00a01\" and \"Voyager\u00a02\" spacecraft are now beyond the outermost planets of the solar system, and \"Voyager\u00a01\" has entered interstellar space. Both records have a projected shelf life of one billion years.\nDruyan is a fellow of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims for the Paranormal (CSICOP).\nDruyan served as program director of the first solar-sail deep-space mission, Cosmos 1, launched on a Russian ICBM in 2005.\nDruyan is involved in multiple Breakthrough Initiatives. With Frank Drake, Druyan is the co-chair of Breakthrough Message and also a member of Breakthrough Starshot.\nShe is a member of the advisory board of The Carl Sagan Institute.\nFilm and television.\nDruyan wrote and produced the 1987 PBS \"NOVA\" episode \"Confessions of a Weaponeer\" on the life of President Eisenhower's Science Advisor George Kistiakowsky.\nIn 2000, Druyan, together with Steve Soter, co-wrote \"Passport to the Universe\", the inaugural planetarium show for the Rose Center for Earth and Space at the American Natural History Museum's Hayden Planetarium. The attraction is narrated by Tom Hanks. Druyan and Soter also co-wrote \"The Search for Life: Are We Alone\", narrated by Harrison Ford, which also debuted at the Hayden's Rose Center.\nIn 2000, Druyan co-founded Cosmos Studios, Inc, with Joseph Firmage. As CEO of Cosmos Studios, Druyan produces science-based entertainment for all media. In addition to \"\", Cosmos Studios has produced \"Cosmic Africa\", \"Lost Dinosaurs of Egypt\", and the Emmy-nominated documentary \"Cosmic Journey: The Voyager Interstellar Mission and Message\". In 2009, she distributed a series of podcasts called \"At Home in the Cosmos with Annie Druyan\", in which she described her works, the life of her husband, Carl Sagan, and their marriage.\nDruyan was one of the three writers of the TV series \"\", along with Carl Sagan and Steven Soter. Druyan is credited, with Carl Sagan, as the co-creator and co-producer of the 1997 feature film \"Contact\".\nIn 2011, it was announced that Druyan would executive produce, co-write, and be one of the episodic directors for a sequel to ', to be called ', which began airing in March 2014. Episodes premiered on Fox and also aired on National Geographic Channel on the following night. At the time of its release, Fox gave the series the largest global rollout of a television series ever, debuting it in 180 countries. The premiere episode was shown across nine of Fox's cable properties in addition to the broadcast network in a \"roadblock\" style premiere. The series went on to become the most-watched series ever for National Geographic Channel International, with at least some part of the 13-episode series watched by 135 million people, including 45 million in the U.S.\nIn March 2020, a third season of \"Cosmos\", named \"\", for which Druyan was executive producer, writer, and director, premiered on National Geographic. Druyan also said: \"I very much have season four in mind, and I know what it\u2019s going to be. And I even know some of the stories that I want to tell in it.\"\nActivism.\nDruyan has for many years been a vocal advocate for nuclear disarmament. She was arrested three times at the Mercury, Nevada nuclear test site during Mikhail Gorbachev's unilateral moratorium on underground nuclear testing, with which President Ronald Reagan did not cooperate. This included an arrest in June 1986, when Druyan crossed a white painted line indicating the test site's boundary; Sagan, who attended the same protest with Druyan, was not arrested.\nIn the early 1990s, Druyan worked with Sagan and then-Senator Al Gore, Jr. and a host of religious and scientific leaders to bring the scientific and religious worlds together in a unified effort to preserve the environment, resulting in the \"Declaration of the 'Mission to Washington\".\nDruyan served as a founding director of the Children's Health Fund until the spring of 2004, a project that provides mobile pediatric care to homeless and disadvantaged children in more than half a dozen cities. She currently serves a member of their Advisory Board.\nDruyan has served on the Board of Directors of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) for over 10 years and was president from 2006 to 2010.\nHonors.\nAn asteroid discovered in 1998 was named in Druyan's honor by its discoverer Eleanor F. Helin. In a 2020 interview with \"Skeptical Inquirer\", Druyan discussed 4970 Druyan and the asteroid named after her late husband, saying that 4970 Druyan is in a \"wedding ring orbit\" around the Sun with 2709 Sagan. Druyan was presented with a plaque on Sagan's sixtieth birthday, which is inscribed: \"Asteroid 2709 Sagan in eternal companion orbit with asteroid 4970 Druyan, symbolic of their love and admiration for each other.\"\nIn November 2006, Druyan was a speaker at \"\".\nIn January 2007, she was a juror at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival, responsible for selecting the winner of the Alfred P. Sloan Prize for films about science and technology.\nIn November 2007, Druyan was awarded the title of \"Humanist Laureate\" by the International Academy of Humanism.\nIn October 2019, the Center for Inquiry West opened the Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan Theater in Los Angeles.\nReligious and philosophical views.\nIn an interview with Joel Achenbach of \"The Washington Post\", Druyan stated that her early interest in science stemmed from a fascination with Karl Marx. Achenbach commented that \"She had, at the time, rather vaporous standards of evidence\", a reference to her belief in the ancient astronauts of Erich von D\u00e4niken and the theories of Immanuel Velikovsky pertaining to the solar system.\nConcerning the death of her husband she stated:\nWhen my husband died, because he was so famous and known for not being a believer, many people would come up to me\u2014it still sometimes happens\u2014and ask me if Carl changed at the end and converted to a belief in an afterlife. They also frequently ask me if I think I will see him again. Carl faced his death with unflagging courage and never sought refuge in illusions. The tragedy was that we knew we would never see each other again. I don't ever expect to be reunited with Carl.\nPersonal life.\nIn 2020, Sagan and Druyan's daughter Sasha Sagan released a book \"For Small Creatures Such As We: Rituals for Finding Meaning in our Unlikely World\", which discusses life with her parents and her father's death when she was fourteen years old.\nDruyan also gave Sasha a recurring role in \"\", where she played her own grandmother, including in the episode \"Man of a Trillion Worlds\", which featured the life of Carl Sagan."}

He studied applied mathematics at the Moscow Aviation Institute. He then went on to work on speech recognition at the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre where he would develop the first version of Tetris on an Electronika 60 computer in 1984.\nAs a child, he was a fan of puzzles and played with pentomino toys. In creating \"Tetris\", he drew inspiration from these toys. Pajitnov created \"Tetris\" with the help of Dmitry Pavlovsky and Vadim Gerasimov in 1984. The game, first available in the Soviet Union, appeared in the West in 1986.\nPajitnov also created a sequel to \"Tetris\", entitled \"Welltris\", which has the same principle, but in a three-dimensional environment where the player sees the playing area from above. \"Tetris\" was licensed and managed by Soviet company ELORG, which had a monopoly on the import and export of computer hardware and software in the Soviet Union, and advertised with the slogan \"From Russia with Love\" (on NES: \"From Russia with Fun!\"). Because he was employed by the Soviet government, Pajitnov did not receive royalties.\nPajitnov, together with Vladimir Pokhilko, moved to the United States in 1991 and later, in 1996, founded The Tetris Company with Henk Rogers, which finally allowed him to collect royalties from his game. He helped design the puzzles in the Super NES versions of \"Yoshi's Cookie\" and designed the game \"Pandora's Box\", which incorporates more traditional jigsaw-style puzzles.\nHe was employed by Microsoft from October 1996 until 2005. While there, he worked on the \"\", MSN Mind Aerobics and MSN Games groups.

At the age of eight his father was imprisoned during a government crackdown on the B\u00e1b\u00ed Faith and the family's possessions were looted, leaving them in virtual poverty. His father was exiled from their native Iran, and the family went to live in Baghdad, where they stayed for nine years. They were later called by the Ottoman state to Istanbul before going into another period of confinement in Edirne and finally the prison-city of \u02bbAkk\u00e1 (Acre). \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 remained a political prisoner there until the Young Turk Revolution freed him in 1908 at the age of 64. He then made several journeys to the West to spread the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed message beyond its middle-eastern roots, but the onset of World War I left him largely confined to Haifa from 1914 to 1918. The war replaced the openly hostile Ottoman authorities with the British Mandate, who knighted him for his help in averting famine following the war.\nIn 1892 \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was appointed in his father's will to be his successor and head of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. He faced opposition from virtually all his family members, but held the loyalty of the great majority of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds around the world. His \"Tablets of the Divine Plan\" helped galvanize Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in North America into spreading the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed teachings to new territories, and his Will and Testament laid the foundation for the current Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed administrative order. Many of his writings, prayers and letters are extant, and his discourses with the Western Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds emphasize the growth of the faith by the late 1890s.\n\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's given name was \u02bbAbb\u00e1s. Depending on context, he would have gone by either M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u02bbAbb\u00e1s (Persian) or \u02bbAbb\u00e1s Effendi (Turkish), both of which are equivalent to the English Sir \u02bbAbb\u00e1s. He preferred the title of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 (\"servant of Bah\u00e1\", a reference to his father). He is commonly referred to in Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed texts as \"The Master\".\nEarly life.\n\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was born in Tehran, Iran on 23 May 1844 (5th of Jamadiyu'l-Avval, 1260 AH), the eldest son of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h and Navv\u00e1b. He was born on the very same night on which the B\u00e1b declared his mission. Born with the given name of \u02bbAbb\u00e1s, he was named after his grandfather M\u00edrz\u00e1 \u02bbAbb\u00e1s N\u00far\u00ed, a prominent and powerful nobleman. As a child, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was shaped by his father's position as a prominent B\u00e1b\u00ed. He recalled how he met the B\u00e1b\u00ed T\u00e1hirih and how she would take \"me on to her knee, caress me, and talk to me. I admired her most deeply\". \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 had a happy and carefree childhood. The family's Tehran home and country houses were comfortable and beautifully decorated. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 enjoyed playing in the gardens with his younger sister with whom he was very close. Along with his younger siblings \u2013 a sister, Bah\u00edyyih, and a brother, Mihd\u00ed \u2013 the three lived in an environment of privilege, happiness and comfort. With his father declining a position as minister of the royal court; during his young boyhood \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 witnessed his parents' various charitable endeavours, which included converting part of the home to a hospital ward for women and children.\n\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 received a haphazard education during his childhood. It was customary not to send children of nobility to schools. Most noblemen were educated at home briefly in scripture, rhetoric, calligraphy and basic mathematics. Many were educated to prepare themselves for life in the royal court. Despite a brief spell at a traditional preparatory school at the age of seven for one year, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 received no formal education. As he grew he was educated by his mother, and uncle. Most of his education however, came from his father. Years later in 1890 Edward Granville Browne described how \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was \"one more eloquent of speech, more ready of argument, more apt of illustration, more intimately acquainted with the sacred books of the Jews, the Christians, and the Muhammadans...scarcely be found even amongst the eloquent.\"\nWhen \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was seven, he contracted tuberculosis and was expected to die. Though the malady faded away, he would be plagued with bouts of illness for the rest of his life.\nOne event that affected \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 greatly during his childhood was the imprisonment of his father when \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was eight years old; the imprisonment led to his family being reduced to poverty and being attacked in the streets by other children. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 accompanied his mother to visit Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h who was then imprisoned in the infamous subterranean dungeon the S\u00edy\u00e1h-Ch\u00e1l. He described how \"I saw a dark, steep place. We entered a small, narrow doorway, and went down two steps, but beyond those one could see nothing. In the middle of the stairway, all of a sudden we heard His [Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's]\u2026voice: 'Do not bring him in here', and so they took me back\".\nBaghdad.\nBah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h was eventually released from prison, but ordered into exile, and \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, then 8 years old, joined his father on the journey to Baghdad in the winter (January to April) of 1853. During the journey \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 suffered from frost-bite. After a year of difficulties Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h absented himself rather than continue to face the conflict with Mirza Yahya and secretly secluded himself in the mountains of Sulaymaniyah in April 1854 a month before \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's tenth birthday. Mutual sorrow resulted in him, his mother and sister becoming constant companions. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was particularly close to both, and his mother took active participation in his education and upbringing. During the two-year absence of his father \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 took up the duty of managing the affairs of the family, before his age of maturity (14 in middle-eastern society) and was known to be occupied with reading and, at a time of hand-copied scriptures being the primary means of publishing, was also engaged in copying the writings of the B\u00e1b. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 also took an interest in the art of horse riding and, as he grew, became a renowned rider.\nIn 1856, news of an ascetic carrying on discourses with local S\u00faf\u00ed leaders that seemed to possibly be Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h reached the family and friends. Immediately, family members and friends went to search for the elusive dervish \u2013 and in March brought Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h back to Baghdad. On seeing his father, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 fell to his knees and wept loudly \"Why did you leave us?\", and this followed with his mother and sister doing the same. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 soon became his father's secretary and shield. During the sojourn in the city \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 grew from a boy into a young man. He was noted as a \"remarkably fine looking youth\", and remembered for his charity and amiableness. Having passed the age of maturity \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was regularly seen in the mosques of Baghdad discussing religious topics and the scripture as a young man. Whilst in Baghdad, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 composed a commentary at the request of his father on the Muslim tradition of \"I was a Hidden Treasure\" for a S\u00faf\u00ed leader named \u02bbAl\u00ed Shawkat P\u00e1sh\u00e1. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was fifteen or sixteen at the time and \u02bbAl\u00ed Shawkat P\u00e1sh\u00e1 regarded the more than 11000 word essay as a remarkable feat for somebody of his age. In 1863, in what became known as the Garden of Ridv\u00e1n, his father Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h announced to a few that he was the manifestation of God and He whom God shall make manifest whose coming had been foretold by the B\u00e1b. On day eight of the twelve days, it is believed \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was the first person Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h revealed his claim to.\nConstantinople/Adrianople.\nIn 1863 Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h was summoned to Constantinople (Istanbul), and thus his family, including \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, then nineteen, accompanied him on his 110-day journey. The journey to Constantinople was another wearisome journey, and \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 helped feed the exiles. It was here that his position became more prominent amongst the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds. This was further solidified by Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's tablet of the Branch in which he constantly exalts his son's virtues and station. The family were soon exiled to Adrianople and \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 went with the family. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 again suffered from frostbite.\nIn Adrianople \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was regarded as the sole comforter of his family \u2013 in particular to his mother. At this point \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was known by the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds as \"the Master\", and by non-Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds as \u02bbAbb\u00e1s Effendi (\"Effendi\" signifies \"Sir\"). It was in Adrianople that Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h referred to his son as \"the Mystery of God\". The title of \"Mystery of God\" symbolises, according to Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, that \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 is not a manifestation of God but how a \"person of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 the incompatible characteristics of a human nature and superhuman knowledge and perfection have been blended and are completely harmonized\". \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was at this point noted for having black hair which flowed to his shoulders, large blue eyes, rose-through-alabaster coloured skin and a fine nose. Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h gave his son many other titles such as \"G\u035fhusn-i-A\u02bbzam\" (meaning \"Mightiest Branch\" or \"Mightier Branch\"), the \"Branch of Holiness\", \"the Center of the Covenant\" and the apple of his eye. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 (\"the Master\") was devastated when hearing the news that he and his family were to be exiled separately from Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. It was, according to Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, through his intercession that the idea was reverted and the family were allowed to be exiled together.\n\u02bbAkk\u00e1.\nAt the age of 24, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was clearly chief-steward to his father and an outstanding member of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed community. Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h and his family were \u2013 in 1868 \u2013 exiled to the penal colony of Acre, Palestine where it was expected that the family would perish. Arrival in \u02bbAkk\u00e1 was distressing for the family and exiles. They were greeted in a hostile manner by the surrounding population and his sister and father fell dangerously ill. When told that the women were to sit on the shoulders of the men to reach the shore, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 took a chair and carried the women to the bay of \u02bbAkk\u00e1. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was able to procure some anesthetic and nursed the sick. The Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds were imprisoned under horrendous conditions in a cluster of cells covered in excrement and dirt. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 himself fell dangerously ill with dysentery, however a sympathetic soldier permitted a physician to help cure him. The population shunned them, the soldiers treated them the same, and the behaviour of Siyyid Muhammad-i-Isfahani (an Azali) did not help matters. Morale was further destroyed with the accidental death of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's youngest brother M\u00edrz\u00e1 Mihd\u00ed at the age of 22. His death devastated the family \u2013 particularly his mother and father \u2013 and the grieving \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 kept a night-long vigil beside his brother's body.\nLater in \u02bbAkk\u00e1.\nOver time, he gradually took over responsibility for the relationships between the small Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed exile community and the outside world. It was through his interaction with the people of \u02bbAkk\u00e1 (Acre) that, according to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, they recognized the innocence of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, and thus the conditions of imprisonment were eased. Four months after the death of Mihd\u00ed the family moved from the prison to the House of \u02bbAbb\u00fad. The people of \u02bbAkk\u00e1 started to respect the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds and in particular, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was able to arrange for houses to be rented for the family, the family later moved to the Mansion of Bahj\u00ed around 1879 when an epidemic caused the inhabitants to flee.\n\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 soon became very popular in the penal colony and Myron Henry Phelps a wealthy New York lawyer described how \"a crowd of human beings...Syrians, Arabs, Ethiopians, and many others\", all waited to talk and receive \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1. He undertook a history of the B\u00e1b\u00ed religion through publication of A Traveller's Narrative (Mak\u00e1la-i-Shakhs\u00ed Sayy\u00e1h) in 1886, later translated and published in translation in 1891 through Cambridge University by the agency of Edward Granville Browne who described \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 as: \nMarriage and family life.\nWhen \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was a young man, speculation was rife amongst the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds to whom he would marry. Several young girls were seen as marriage prospects but \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 seemed disinclined to marriage. On 8 March 1873, at the urging of his father, the twenty-eight-year-old \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 married F\u00e1timih Nahr\u00ed of Isfah\u00e1n (1847\u20131938) a twenty-five-year-old from an upper-class family of the city. Her father was M\u00edrz\u00e1 Mu\u1e25ammad \u02bbAl\u00ed Nahr\u00ed of Isfahan an eminent Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed with prominent connections. F\u00e1timih was brought from Persia to \u02bbAkk\u00e1 after both Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h and his wife Navv\u00e1b expressed an interest in her to marry \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1. After a wearisome journey from Isfah\u00e1n to Akka she finally arrived accompanied by her brother in 1872. The young couple were betrothed for about five months before the marriage itself commenced. In the meantime, F\u00e1timih lived in the home of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's uncle M\u00edrz\u00e1 M\u00fas\u00e1. According to her later memoirs, F\u00e1timih fell in love with \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 on seeing him. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 himself had showed little inkling to marriage until meeting F\u00e1timih; who was entitled Mun\u00edrih by Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. Mun\u00edrih is a title meaning \"Luminous\".\nThe marriage resulted in nine children. The first born was a son Mihd\u00ed Effendi who died aged about 3. He was followed by \u1e0c\u00edy\u00e1\u02bc\u00edyyih K\u035fh\u00e1num, Fu\u02bc\u00e1d\u00edyyih K\u035fh\u00e1num (d. few years old), R\u00fahang\u00edz Kh\u00e1num (d. 1893), T\u00fab\u00e1 Kh\u00e1num, Husayn Effendi (d.1887 aged 5), T\u00fab\u00e1 K\u035fh\u00e1num, R\u00fah\u00e1 K\u035fh\u00e1num (mother of Munib Shahid), and Munnavar K\u035fh\u00e1num. The death of his children caused \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 immense grief \u2013 in particular the death of his son Husayn Effendi came at a difficult time following the death of his mother and uncle. The surviving children (all daughters) were; \u1e0c\u00edy\u00e1\u02bc\u00edyyih K\u035fh\u00e1num (mother of Shoghi Effendi) (d. 1951) T\u00fab\u00e1 K\u035fh\u00e1num (1880\u20131959) R\u00fa\u1e25\u00e1 K\u035fh\u00e1num and Munavvar K\u035fh\u00e1num (d. 1971). Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h wished that the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds follow the example of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and gradually move away from polygamy. The marriage of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 to one woman and his choice to remain monogamous, from advice of his father and his own wish, legitimised the practice of monogamy to a people who hitherto had regarded polygamy as a righteous way of life.\nEarly years of his ministry.\nAfter Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h died on 29 May 1892, the Will and Testament of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h named \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 as Centre of the Covenant, successor and interpreter of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's writings.\nBah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h designates his successor with the following verses:\nThis translation of the \"Kit\u00e1b-i-\u02bbAhd\" is based on a solecism, however, as the terms \"Akbar\" and \"A\u02bbzam\" do not mean, respectively, 'Greater' and 'Most Great'. Not only do the two words derive from entirely separate triconsonantal roots (\"Akbar\" from \"k-b-r\" and \"A\u02bbzam\" from \"\u02bb-z-m\"), but the Arabic language possesses the elative, a stage of gradation, with no clear distinction between the comparative and superlative. In the Will and Testament \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's half-brother, Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed, was mentioned by name as being subordinate to \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1. Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed became jealous of his half-brother and set out to establish authority for himself as an alternative leader with the support of his brothers Badi\u02bbu'llah and \u1e0c\u00edy\u00e1\u02bcu'llah. He began correspondence with Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in Iran, initially in secret, casting doubts in others' minds about \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1. While most Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds followed \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, a handful followed Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed including such leaders as Mirza Javad and Ibrahim George Kheiralla, an early Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed missionary to America.\nMuhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed and Mirza Javad began to openly accuse \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 of taking on too much authority, suggesting that he believed himself to be a Manifestation of God, equal in status to Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h. It was at this time that \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, to provide proof of the falsity of the accusations leveled against him, in tablets to the West, stated that he was to be known as \"\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1\" an Arabic phrase meaning the Servant of Bah\u00e1 to make it clear that he was not a Manifestation of God, and that his station was only servitude. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 left a Will and Testament that set up the framework of administration. The two highest institutions were the Universal House of Justice, and the Guardianship, for which he appointed Shoghi Effendi as the Guardian. With the exception of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and Shoghi Effendi, Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed was supported by all of the remaining male relatives of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h, including Shoghi Effendi's father, M\u00edrz\u00e1 H\u00e1d\u00ed Sh\u00edr\u00e1z\u00ed. However Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed's and his families statements had very little effect on the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in general - in the \u02bbAkk\u00e1 area, the followers of Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed represented six families at most, they had no common religious activities, and were almost wholly assimilated into Muslim society.\nFirst Western pilgrims.\nBy the end of 1898, Western pilgrims started coming to Akka on pilgrimage to visit \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1; this group of pilgrims, including Phoebe Hearst, was the first time that Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds raised up in the West had met \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1. The first group arrived in 1898 and throughout late 1898 to early 1899 Western Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds sporadically visited \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1. The group was relatively young containing mainly women from high American society in their 20s. The group of Westerners aroused suspicion for the authorities, and consequently \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's confinement was tightened. During the next decade \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 would be in constant communication with Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds around the world, helping them to teach the religion; the group included May Ellis Bolles in Paris, Englishman Thomas Breakwell, American Herbert Hopper, French , Susan Moody, Lua Getsinger, and American Laura Clifford Barney. It was Laura Clifford Barney who, by asking questions of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 over many years and many visits to Haifa, compiled what later became the book Some Answered Questions.\nMinistry, 1901\u20131912.\nDuring the final years of the 19th century, while \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was still officially a prisoner and confined to \u02bbAkka, he organized the transfer of the remains of the B\u00e1b from Iran to Palestine. He then organized the purchase of land on Mount Carmel that Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h had instructed should be used to lay the remains of the B\u00e1b, and organized for the construction of the Shrine of the B\u00e1b. This process took another 10 years. With the increase of pilgrims visiting \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed worked with the Ottoman authorities to re-introduce stricter terms on \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's imprisonment in August 1901. By 1902, however, due to the Governor of \u02bbAkka being supportive of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, the situation was greatly eased; while pilgrims were able to once again visit \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1, he was confined to the city. In February 1903, two followers of Muhammad \u02bbAl\u00ed, including Badi\u02bbu'llah and Siyyid \u02bbAliy-i-Afnan, broke with Muhammad \u02bbAli and wrote books and letters giving details of Muhammad \u02bbAli's plots and noting that what was circulating about \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was fabrication.\nFrom 1902 to 1904, in addition to the building of the Shrine of the B\u00e1b that \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was directing, he started to put into execution two different projects; the restoration of the House of the B\u00e1b in Shiraz, Iran and the construction of the first Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed House of Worship in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 asked Aqa Mirza Aqa to coordinate the work so that the house of the B\u00e1b would be restored to the state that it was at the time of the B\u00e1b's declaration to Mulla Husayn in 1844; he also entrusted the work on the House of Worship to Vakil-u'd-Dawlih.\nDuring this period, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 communicated with a number of Young Turks, opposed to the reign of Sultan Abdul Hamid II, including Nam\u0131k Kemal, Ziya Pasha and Midhat Pasha, in an attempt to disseminate Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed thought into their political ideology. He emphasized Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds \"seek freedom and love liberty, hope for equality, are well-wishers of humanity and ready to sacrifice their lives to unite humanity\" but on a more broad approach than the Young Turks. Abdullah Cevdet, one of the founders of the Committee of Union and Progress who considered the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith an intermediary step between Islam and the ultimate abandonment of religious belief, would go on trial for defense of Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in a periodical he founded.\n\u201bAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 also had contact with military leaders as well, including such individuals as Bursal\u0131 Mehmet Tahir Bey and Hasan Bedreddin. The latter, who was involved in the overthrow of Sultan Abd\u00fclaziz, is commonly known as Bedri Pa\u015fa or Bedri Pasha and is referred to in Persian Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed sources as Bedri Bey (Badri Beg). He was a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed who translated \u201bAbdu'l-Baha's works into French.\n\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 also met Muhammad Abduh, one of the key figures of Islamic Modernism and the Salafi movement, in Beirut, at a time when the two men were both opposed to the Ottoman \"ulama\" and shared similar goals of religious reform. Rashid Rida asserts that during his visits to Beirut, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 would attend Abduh's study sessions. Regarding the meetings of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and Muhammad \u02bbAbduh, Shoghi Effendi asserts that \"His several interviews with the well-known Shaykh Muhammad \u02bbAbdu served to enhance immensely the growing prestige of the community and spread abroad the fame of its most distinguished member.\"\nDue to \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's political activities and alleged accusation against him by Muhammad \u02bbAli, a Commission of Inquiry interviewed \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 in 1905, with the result that he was almost exiled to Fezzan. In response, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 wrote the sultan a letter protesting that his followers refrain from involvement in partisan politics and that his \"tariqa\" had guided many Americans to Islam. The next few years in \u02bbAkka were relatively free of pressures and pilgrims were able to come and visit \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1. By 1909 the mausoleum of the Shrine of the B\u00e1b was completed.\nJourneys to the West.\nThe 1908 Young Turks revolution freed all political prisoners in the Ottoman Empire, and \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was freed from imprisonment. His first action after his freedom was to visit the Shrine of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h in Bahji. While \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 continued to live in \u02bbAkka immediately following the revolution, he soon moved to live in Haifa near the Shrine of the B\u00e1b. In 1910, with the freedom to leave the country, he embarked on a three-year journey to Egypt, Europe, and North America, spreading the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed message.\nFrom August to December 1911, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 visited cities in Europe, including London, Bristol, and Paris. The purpose of these trips was to support the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed communities in the west and to further spread his father's teachings.\nIn the following year, he undertook a much more extensive journey to the United States and Canada to once again spread his father's teachings. He arrived in New York City on 11 April 1912, after declining an offer of passage on the RMS \"Titanic\", telling the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed believers, instead, to \"Donate this to charity.\" He instead travelled on a slower craft, the RMS \"Cedric\", and cited preference of a longer sea journey as the reason. After hearing of the Titanic's sinking on 16 April he was quoted as saying \"I was asked to sail upon the Titanic, but my heart did not prompt me to do so.\" While he spent most of his time in New York, he visited Chicago, Cleveland, Pittsburgh, Washington, D.C., Boston and Philadelphia. In August of the same year he started a more extensive journey to places including New Hampshire, the Green Acre school in Maine, and Montreal (his only visit to Canada). He then travelled west to Minneapolis, San Francisco, Stanford, and Los Angeles before starting to return east at the end of October. On 5 December 1912 he set sail back to Europe.\nDuring his visit to North America he visited many missions, churches, and groups, as well as having scores of meetings in Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds' homes, and offering innumerable personal meetings with hundreds of people. During his talks he proclaimed Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed principles such as the unity of God, unity of the religions, oneness of humanity, equality of women and men, world peace and economic justice. He also insisted that all his meetings be open to all races.\nHis visit and talks were the subject of hundreds of newspaper articles. In Boston newspaper reporters asked \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 why he had come to America, and he stated that he had come to participate in conferences on peace and that just giving warning messages is not enough. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's visit to Montreal provided notable newspaper coverage; on the night of his arrival the editor of the \"Montreal Daily Star\" met with him and that newspaper along with The Montreal Gazette, \"Montreal Standard\", Le Devoir and La Presse among others reported on \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's activities. The headlines in those papers included \"Persian Teacher to Preach Peace\", \"Racialism Wrong, Says Eastern Sage, Strife and War Caused by Religious and National Prejudices\", and \"Apostle of Peace Meets Socialists, Abdul Baha's Novel Scheme for Distribution of Surplus Wealth.\" The \"Montreal Standard\", which was distributed across Canada, took so much interest that it republished the articles a week later; the Gazette published six articles and Montreal's largest French language newspaper published two articles about him. His 1912 visit to Montreal also inspired humourist Stephen Leacock to parody him in his bestselling 1914 book \"Arcadian Adventures with the Idle Rich\". In Chicago one newspaper headline included \"His Holiness Visits Us, Not Pius X but A. Baha,\" and \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's visit to California was reported in the \"Palo Altan\".\nBack in Europe, he visited London, Paris (where he stayed for two months), Stuttgart, Budapest, and Vienna. Finally, on 12 June 1913, he returned to Egypt, where he stayed for six months before returning to Haifa.\nOn 23 February 1914, at the eve of World War I, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 hosted Baron Edmond James de Rothschild, a member of the Rothschild banking family who was a leading advocate and financier of the Zionist movement, during one of his early trips to Palestine.\nFinal years (1914\u20131921).\nDuring World War I (1914\u20131918) \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 stayed in Palestine and was unable to travel. He carried on a limited correspondence, which included the \"Tablets of the Divine Plan\", a collection of 14 letters addressed to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds of North America, later described as one of three \"charters\" of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith. The letters assign a leadership role for the North American Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds in spreading the religion around the planet.\nHaifa was under real threat of Allied bombardment, enough that \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 and other Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds temporarily retreated to the hills east of \u02bbAkka.\n\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 was also under threats from Cemal Pa\u015fa, the Ottoman military chief who at one point expressed his desire to crucify him and destroy Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed properties in Palestine. The surprisingly swift Megiddo offensive of the British General Allenby swept away the Turkish forces in Palestine before harm was done to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds, and the war was over less than two months later.\nPost-war period.\nThe conclusion of World War I led to the openly hostile Ottoman authorities being replaced by the more friendly British Mandate, allowing for a renewal of correspondence, pilgrims, and development of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed World Centre properties. It was during this revival of activity that the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith saw an expansion and consolidation in places like Egypt, the Caucasus, Iran, Turkmenistan, North America and South Asia under the leadership of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1.\nThe end of the war brought about several political developments that \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 commented on. The League of Nations formed in January 1920, representing the first instance of collective security through a worldwide organization. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 had written in 1875 for the need to establish a \"Union of the nations of the world\", and he praised the attempt through the League of Nations as an important step towards the goal. He also said that it was \"incapable of establishing Universal Peace\" because it did not represent all nations and had only trivial power over its member states. Around the same time, the British Mandate supported the ongoing immigration of Jews to Palestine. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 mentioned the immigration as a fulfillment of prophecy, and encouraged the Zionists to develop the land and \"elevate the country for all its inhabitants... They must not work to separate the Jews from the other Palestinians.\"\nThe war also left the region in famine. In 1901, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 had purchased about 1704 acres of scrubland near the Jordan river and by 1907 many Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds from Iran had begun sharecropping on the land. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 received between 20 and 33% of their harvest (or cash equivalent), which was shipped to Haifa. With the war still raging in 1917, \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 received a large amount of wheat from the crops, and also bought other available wheat and shipped it all back to Haifa. The wheat arrived just after the British captured Palestine, and as such was allowed to be widely distributed to allay the famine. For this service in averting a famine in Northern Palestine he received a knighthood at a ceremony held in his honor at the home of the British Governor on 27 April 1920. He was later visited by General Allenby, King Faisal (later king of Iraq), Herbert Samuel (High Commissioner for Palestine), and Ronald Storrs (Military Governor of Jerusalem).\nDeath and funeral.\n\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 died on Monday, 28 November 1921, sometime after 1:15\u00a0a.m. (27th of Rabi' al-awwal, 1340 AH).\nThen Colonial Secretary Winston Churchill telegraphed the High Commissioner for Palestine, \"convey to the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Community, on behalf of His Majesty's Government, their sympathy and condolescence.\" Similar messages came from Viscount Allenby, the Council of Ministers of Iraq, and others.\nOn his funeral, which was held the next day, Esslemont notes:\nAmong the talks delivered at the funeral, Shoghi Effendi records Stewart Symes giving the following tribute:\nHe was buried in the front room of the Shrine of the B\u00e1b on Mount Carmel. His interment there is meant to be temporary, until his own mausoleum can be built in the vicinity of Ri\u1e0dv\u00e1n Garden.\nLegacy.\n\u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 left a \"Will and Testament\" that was originally written between 1901 and 1908 and addressed to Shoghi Effendi, who at that time was only 4\u201311 years old. The will appoints Shoghi Effendi as the first in a line of Guardians of the religion, a hereditary executive role that may provide authoritative interpretations of scripture. \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 directed all Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds to turn to him and obey him, and assured him of divine protection and guidance. The will also provided a formal reiteration of his teachings, such as the instructions to teach, manifest spiritual qualities, associate with all people, and shun Covenant-breakers. Many obligations of the Universal House of Justice and the Hands of the Cause were also elaborated. Shoghi Effendi later described the document as one of three \"charters\" of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nThe authenticity and provisions of the will were almost universally accepted by Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds around the world, with the exception of Ruth White and a few other Americans who tried to protest Shoghi Effendi's leadership.\nDuring his lifetime there was some ambiguity among Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00eds as to his station relative to Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h, and later to Shoghi Effendi. Some American newspapers reported him to be a Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed prophet or the return of Christ. Shoghi Effendi later formalized his legacy as the last of three \"Central Figures\" of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith and the \"Perfect exemplar\" of the teachings, also claiming that holding him on an equal status to Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h or Jesus was heretical. Shoghi Effendi also wrote that during the anticipated Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed dispensation of 1000 years there will be no equal to \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1.\nWorks.\nThe total estimated number of tablets that \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 wrote are over 27,000 of which only a fraction have been translated into English. His works fall into two groups including first his direct writings and second his lectures and speeches as noted by others. The first group includes \"The Secret of Divine Civilization\" written before 1875, \"A Traveller's Narrative\" written around 1886, the Res\u0101la-ye s\u012b\u0101s\u012bya or \"Sermon on the Art of Governance\" written in 1893, the \"Memorials of the Faithful\", and a large number of tablets written to various people; including various Western intellectuals such as Auguste Forel which has been translated and published as the \"Tablet to Auguste-Henri Forel\". The \"Secret of Divine Civilization\" and the \"Sermon on the Art of Governance\" were widely circulated anonymously.\nThe second group includes \"Some Answered Questions\", which is an English translation of a series of table talks with Laura Barney, and \"Paris Talks\", \"\u02bbAbdu'l-Baha in London\" and \"Promulgation of Universal Peace\" which are respectively addresses given by \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1 in Paris, London and the United States.\nThe following is a list of some of \u02bbAbdu'l-Bah\u00e1's many books, tablets, and talks:"}
{"id": "3020", "revid": "32924478", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3020", "title": "Ambrose of Alexandria", "text": "Ambrose of Alexandria (before 212 \u2013 c. 250) was a friend of the Christian theologian Origen. Ambrose was attracted by Origen's fame as a teacher, and visited the Catechetical School of Alexandria in 212. At first a gnostic Valentinian and Marcionist, Ambrose, through Origen's teaching, eventually rejected this theology and became Origen's constant companion, and was ordained deacon. He plied Origen with questions, and urged him to write his Commentaries (treating him as \"\" in \"Commentary on John\" V,1) on the books of the Bible, and, as a wealthy nobleman and courtier, he provided his teacher with books for his studies and secretaries to lighten the labor of composition.\nHe suffered during the persecution under the Roman emperor Maximinus Thrax in 235. He was later released and died a confessor. The last mention of Ambrose in the historical record is in Origen's \"Contra Celsum,\" which the latter wrote at the solicitation of Ambrose.\nOrigen often speaks of Ambrose in affectionately as a man of education with excellent literary and scholarly tastes. All of Origen's works written after 218 are dedicated to Ambrose, including his \"On Martyrdom\", \"Contra Celsum\", \"Commentary on St. John's Gospel\", and \"On Prayer\". Ambrose's letters to Origen (praised by Jerome) are lost, although part of one exists.\nVeneration.\nAmbrose is venerated as a saint by some branches of Christianity. His feast day in the Catholic Church falls on 17 March."}
{"id": "3022", "revid": "23150529", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3022", "title": "Autonomous building", "text": "An autonomous building is a building designed to be operated independently from infrastructural support services such as the electric power grid, gas grid, municipal water systems, sewage treatment systems, storm drains, communication services, and in some cases, public roads.\nAdvocates of autonomous building describe advantages that include reduced environmental impacts, increased security, and lower costs of ownership. Some cited advantages satisfy tenets of green building, not independence per se (see below). Off-grid buildings often rely very little on civil services and are therefore safer and more comfortable during civil disaster or military attacks. For example, Off-grid buildings would not lose power or water if public supplies were compromised.\nAs of 2018, most research and published articles concerning autonomous building focus on residential homes.\nIn 2002, British architects Brenda and Robert Vale said that\nIt is quite possible in all parts of Australia to construct a 'house with no bills', which would be comfortable without heating and cooling, which would make its own electricity, collect its own water and deal with its own waste...These houses can be built now, using off-the-shelf techniques. It is possible to build a \"house with no bills\" for the same price as a conventional house, but it would be (25%) smaller.\nHistory.\nIn the 1970s, groups of activists and engineers were inspired by the warnings of imminent resource depletion and starvation. In the United States a group calling themselves the New Alchemists were famous for the depth of research effort placed in their projects. Using conventional construction techniques, they designed a series of \"bioshelter\" projects, the most famous of which was the Ark Bioshelter community for Prince Edward Island. They published the plans for all of these, with detailed design calculations and blueprints. The Ark used wind-based water pumping and electricity and was self-contained in food production. It had living quarters for people, fish tanks raising tilapia for protein, a greenhouse watered with fish water, and a closed-loop sewage reclamation system that recycled human waste into sanitized fertilizer for the fish tanks. As of January 2010, the successor organization to the New Alchemists has a web page up as the \"New Alchemy Institute\". The PEI Ark has been abandoned and partially renovated several times.\nThe 1990s saw the development of Earthships, similar in intent to the Ark project, but organized as a for-profit venture, with construction details published in a series of 3 books by Mike Reynolds. The building material is tires filled with earth. This makes a wall that has large amounts of thermal mass (see earth sheltering). Berms are placed on exposed surfaces to further increase the house's temperature stability. The water system starts with rain water, processed for drinking, then washing, then plant watering, then toilet flushing, and finally black water is recycled again for more plant watering. The cisterns are placed and used as thermal masses. Power, including electricity, heat and water heating, is from solar power.\n1990s architects such as William McDonough and Ken Yeang applied environmentally responsible building design to large commercial buildings, such as office buildings, making them largely self-sufficient in energy production. One major bank building (ING's Amsterdam headquarters) in the Netherlands was constructed to be autonomous and artistic as well.\nAdvantages.\nAs an architect or engineer becomes more concerned with the disadvantages of transportation networks, and dependence on distant resources, their designs tend to include more autonomous elements. The historic path to autonomy was a concern for secure sources of heat, power, water and food. A nearly parallel path toward autonomy has been to start with a concern for environmental impacts, which cause disadvantages.\nAutonomous buildings can increase security and reduce environmental impacts by using on-site resources (such as sunlight and rain) that would otherwise be wasted. Autonomy often dramatically reduces the costs and impacts of networks that serve the building, because autonomy short-circuits the multiplying inefficiencies of collecting and transporting resources. Other impacted resources, such as oil reserves and the retention of the local watershed, can often be cheaply conserved by thoughtful designs.\nAutonomous buildings are usually energy-efficient in operation, and therefore cost-efficient, for the obvious reason that smaller energy needs are easier to satisfy off-grid. But they may substitute energy production or other techniques to avoid diminishing returns in extreme conservation.\nAn autonomous structure is not always environmentally friendly. The goal of independence from support systems is associated with, but not identical to, other goals of environmentally responsible green building. However, autonomous buildings also usually include some degree of sustainability through the use of renewable energy and other renewable resources, producing no more greenhouse gases than they consume, and other measures.\nDisadvantages.\nFirst and fundamentally, independence is a matter of degree, with many choices. For example, eliminating dependence on the electrical grid is relatively easy. In contrast, running an efficient, reliable food source can be a chore.\nLiving within an autonomous shelter may also require sacrifices in lifestyle or social opportunities. Even the most comfortable and technologically advanced autonomous homes could require alterations of residents' behavior. Some may not welcome the extra chores. The Vails described some clients' experiences as inconvenient, irritating, isolating, or even as an unwanted full-time job. A well-designed building can reduce this issue, but usually at the expense of reduced autonomy.\nAn autonomous house must be custom-built (or extensively retrofitted) to suit the climate and location. Passive solar techniques, alternative toilet and sewage systems, thermal massing designs, basement battery systems, efficient windowing, and the array of other design tactics require some degree of non-standard construction, added expense, ongoing experimentation and maintenance, and also have an effect on the psychology of the space.\nSystems.\nThis section includes some minimal descriptions of methods, to give some feel for such a building's practicality, provide indexes to further information, and give a sense of modern trends.\nWater.\nThere are many methods of collecting and conserving water. Use reduction is cost-effective.\nGreywater systems reuse drained wash water to flush toilets or to water lawns and gardens. Greywater systems can halve the water use of most residential buildings; however, they require the purchase of a sump, greywater pressurization pump, and secondary plumbing. Some builders are installing waterless urinals and even composting toilets that completely eliminate water usage in sewage disposal.\nThe classic solution with minimal life-style changes is using a well. Once drilled, a well-foot requires substantial power. However, advanced well-foots can reduce power usage by twofold or more from older models. Well water can be contaminated in some areas. The Sono arsenic filter eliminates unhealthy arsenic in well water.\nHowever drilling a well is an uncertain activity, with aquifers depleted in some areas. It can also be expensive.\nIn regions with sufficient rainfall, it is often more economical to design a building to use rainwater harvesting, with supplementary water deliveries in a drought. Rain water makes excellent soft washwater, but needs antibacterial treatment. If used for drinking, mineral supplements or mineralization is necessary.\nMost desert and temperate climates get at least of rain per year. This means that a typical one-story house with a greywater system can supply its year-round water needs from its roof alone. In the driest areas, it might require a cistern of . Many areas average of rain per week, and these can use a cistern as small as .\nIn many areas, it is difficult to keep a roof clean enough for drinking. To reduce dirt and bad tastes, systems use a metal collecting-roof and a \"roof cleaner\" tank that diverts the first 40 liters. Cistern water is usually chlorinated, though reverse osmosis systems provide even better quality drinking water.\nIn the classic Roman house (\"Domus\"), household water was provided from a cistern (the \"impluvium\"), which was a decorative feature of the atrium, the house's main public space. It was fed by downspout tiles from the inward-facing roof-opening (the \"compluvium\"). Often water lilies were grown in it to purify the water. Wealthy households often supplemented the rain with a small fountain fed from a city's cistern. The impluvium always had an overflow drain so it could not flood the house.\nModern cisterns are usually large plastic tanks. Gravity tanks on short towers are reliable, so pump repairs are less urgent. The least expensive bulk cistern is a fenced pond or pool at ground level.\nReducing autonomy reduces the size and expense of cisterns. Many autonomous homes can reduce water use below per person per day, so that in a drought a month of water can be delivered inexpensively via truck. Self-delivery is often possible by installing fabric water tanks that fit the bed of a pick-up truck.\nIt can be convenient to use the cistern as a heat sink or trap for a heat pump or air conditioning system; however this can make cold drinking water warm, and in drier years may decrease the efficiency of the HVAC system.\nSolar stills can efficiently produce drinking water from ditch water or cistern water, especially high-efficiency multiple effect humidification designs, which separate the evaporator(s) and condenser(s).\nNew technologies, like reverse osmosis can create unlimited amounts of pure water from polluted water, ocean water, and even from humid air. Watermakers are available for yachts that convert seawater and electricity into potable water and brine. Atmospheric water generators extract moisture from dry desert air and filter it to pure water.\nSewage.\nResource.\nComposting toilets use bacteria to decompose human feces into useful, odourless, sanitary compost. The process is sanitary because soil bacteria eat the human pathogens as well as most of the mass of the waste. Nevertheless, most health authorities forbid direct use of \"humanure\" for growing food. The risk is microbial and viral contamination. In a dry composting toilet, the waste is evaporated or digested to gas (mostly carbon dioxide) and vented, so a toilet produces only a few pounds of compost every six months. To control the odor, modern toilets use a small fan to keep the toilet under negative pressure, and exhaust the gasses to a vent pipe.\nSome home sewage treatment systems use biological treatment, usually beds of plants and aquaria, that absorb nutrients and bacteria and convert greywater and sewage to clear water. This odor- and color-free reclaimed water can be used to flush toilets and water outside plants. When tested, it approaches standards for potable water. In climates that freeze, the plants and aquaria need to be kept in a small greenhouse space. Good systems need about as much care as a large aquarium.\nElectric incinerating toilets turn excrement into a small amount of ash. They are cool to the touch, have no water and no pipes, and require an air vent in a wall. They are used in remote areas where use of septic tanks is limited, usually to reduce nutrient loads in lakes.\nNASA's bioreactor is an extremely advanced biological sewage system. It can turn sewage into air and water through microbial action. NASA plans to use it in the manned Mars mission. Another method is NASA's urine-to-water distillation system.\nA big disadvantage of complex biological sewage treatment systems is that if the house is empty, the sewage system biota may starve to death.\nWaste.\nSewage handling is essential for public health. Many diseases are transmitted by poorly functioning sewage systems.\nThe standard system is a tiled leach field combined with a septic tank. The basic idea is to provide a small system with primary sewage treatment. Sludge settles to the bottom of the septic tank, is partially reduced by anaerobic digestion, and fluid is dispersed in the leach field. The leach field is usually under a yard growing grass. Septic tanks can operate entirely by gravity, and if well managed, are reasonably safe.\nSeptic tanks have to be pumped periodically by a vacuum truck to eliminate non reducing solids. Failure to pump a septic tank can cause overflow that damages the leach field, and contaminates ground water. Septic tanks may also require some lifestyle changes, such as not using garbage disposals, minimizing fluids flushed into the tank, and minimizing nondigestible solids flushed into the tank. For example, septic safe toilet paper is recommended.\nHowever, septic tanks remain popular because they permit standard plumbing fixtures, and require few or no lifestyle sacrifices.\nComposting or packaging toilets make it economical and sanitary to throw away sewage as part of the normal garbage collection service. They also reduce water use by half, and eliminate the difficulty and expense of septic tanks. However, they require the local landfill to use sanitary practices.\nIncinerator systems are quite practical. The ashes are biologically safe, and less than 1/10 the volume of the original waste, but like all incinerator waste, are usually classified as hazardous waste.\nTraditional methods of sewage handling include pit toilets, latrines, and outhouses. These can be safe, inexpensive and practical. They are still used in many regions.\nStorm drains.\nDrainage systems are a crucial compromise between human habitability and a secure, sustainable watershed. Paved areas and lawns or turf do not allow much precipitation to filter through the ground to recharge aquifers. They can cause flooding and damage in neighbourhoods, as the water flows over the surface towards a low point.\nTypically, elaborate, capital-intensive storm sewer networks are engineered to deal with stormwater. In some cities, such as the Victorian era London sewers or much of the old City of Toronto, the storm water system is combined with the sanitary sewer system. In the event of heavy precipitation, the load on the sewage treatment plant at the end of the pipe becomes too great to handle and raw sewage is dumped into holding tanks, and sometimes into surface water.\nAutonomous buildings can address precipitation in a number of ways:\nIf a water-absorbing swale for each yard is combined with permeable concrete streets, storm drains can be omitted from the neighbourhood. This can save more than $800 per house (1970s) by eliminating storm drains. One way to use the savings is to purchase larger lots, which permits more amenities at the same cost. Permeable concrete is an established product in warm climates, and in development for freezing climates. In freezing climates, the elimination of storm drains can often still pay for enough land to construct swales (shallow water collecting ditches) or water impeding berms instead. This plan provides more land for homeowners and can offer more interesting topography for landscaping.\nA green roof captures precipitation and uses the water to grow plants. It can be built into a new building or used to replace an existing roof.\nElectricity.\nSince electricity is an expensive utility, the first step towards autonomy is to design a house and lifestyle to reduce demand. LED lights, laptop computers and gas-powered refrigerators save electricity, although gas-powered refrigerators are not very efficient. There are also superefficient electric refrigerators, such as those produced by the Sun Frost company, some of which use only about half as much electricity as a mass-market energy star-rated refrigerator.\nUsing a solar roof, solar cells can provide electric power. Solar roofs can be more cost-effective than retrofitted solar power, because buildings need roofs anyway. Modern solar cells last about 40 years, which makes them a reasonable investment in some areas. At a sufficient angle, solar cells are cleaned by run-off rain water and therefore have almost no life-style impact.\nHowever, many areas have long winter nights or dark cloudy days. In these climates, a solar installation might not pay for itself or large battery storage systems are necessary to achieve electric self-sufficiency. In stormy or windy climates, wind generators can replace or significantly supplement solar power. The average autonomous house needs only one small wind turbine, 5 metres or less in diameter. On a 30-metre (100-foot) tower, this turbine can provide enough power to supplement solar power on cloudy days. Commercially available wind turbines use sealed, one-moving-part AC generators and passive, self-feathering blades for years of operation without service.\nThe main advantage of wind power is that larger wind turbines have a lower per-watt cost than solar cells, provided there is wind. However, location is critical. Just as some locations lack sun for solar cells, many areas lack enough wind to make a turbine pay for itself. In the Great Plains of the United States, a 10-metre (33-foot) turbine can supply enough energy to heat and cool a well-built all-electric house. Economic use in other areas requires research, and possibly a site-survey.\nSome sites have access to a stream with a change in elevation. These sites can use small hydropower systems to generate electricity. If the difference in elevation is above 30 metres (100 feet), and the stream runs in all seasons, this can provide continuous power with a small, inexpensive installation. Lower changes of elevation require larger installations or dams, and can be less efficient. Clogging at the turbine intake can be a practical problem. The usual solution is a small pool and waterfall (a penstock) to carry away floating debris. Another solution is to utilize a turbine that resists debris, such as a Gorlov helical turbine or Ossberger turbine.\nDuring times of low demand, excess power can be stored in batteries for future use. However, batteries need to be replaced every few years. In many areas, battery expenses can be eliminated by attaching the building to the electric power grid and operating the power system with net metering. Utility permission is required, but such cooperative generation is legally mandated in some areas (for example, California).\nA grid-based building is less autonomous, but more economical and sustainable with fewer lifestyle sacrifices. In rural areas the grid's cost and impacts can be reduced by using single-wire earth return systems (for example, the MALT-system).\nIn areas that lack access to the grid, battery size can be reduced with a generator to recharge the batteries during energy droughts such as extended fogs. Auxiliary generators are usually run from propane, natural gas, or sometimes diesel. An hour of charging usually provides a day of operation. Modern residential chargers permit the user to set the charging times, so the generator is quiet at night. Some generators automatically test themselves once per week.\nRecent advances in passively stable magnetic bearings may someday permit inexpensive storage of power in a flywheel in a vacuum. Research groups like Canada's Ballard Power Systems are also working to develop a \"regenerative fuel cell\", a device that can generate hydrogen and oxygen when power is available, and combine these efficiently when power is needed.\nEarth batteries tap electric currents in the earth called telluric current. They can be installed anywhere in the ground. They provide only low voltages and current. They were used to power telegraphs in the 19th century. As appliance efficiencies increase, they may become practical.\nMicrobial fuel cells and thermoelectric generators allow electricity to be generated from biomass. The plant can be dried, chopped and converted or burned as a whole, or it can be left alive so that waste saps from the plant can be converted by bacteria.\nHeating.\nMost autonomous buildings are designed to use insulation, thermal mass and passive solar heating and cooling. Examples of these are trombe walls and other technologies as skylights.\nPassive solar heating can heat most buildings in even the mild and chilly climates. In colder climates, extra construction costs can be as little as 15% more than new, conventional buildings. In warm climates, those having less than two weeks of frosty nights per year, there is no cost impact.\nThe basic requirement for passive solar heating is that the solar collectors must face the prevailing sunlight (south in the Northern Hemisphere, north in the Southern Hemisphere), and the building must incorporate thermal mass to keep it warm in the night.\nA recent, somewhat experimental solar heating system \"Annualized geo solar heating\" is practical even in regions that get little or no sunlight in winter. It uses the ground beneath a building for thermal mass. Precipitation can carry away the heat, so the ground is shielded with skirts of plastic insulation. The thermal mass of this system is sufficiently inexpensive and large that it can store enough summer heat to warm a building for the whole winter, and enough winter cold to cool the building in summer.\nIn annualized geo solar systems, the solar collector is often separate from (and hotter or colder than) the living space. The building may actually be constructed from insulation, for example, straw-bale construction. Some buildings have been aerodynamically designed so that convection via ducts and interior spaces eliminates any need for electric fans.\nA more modest \"daily solar\" design is very practical. For example, for about a 15% premium in building costs, the Passivhaus building codes in Europe use high performance insulating windows, R-30 insulation, HRV ventilation, and a small thermal mass. With modest changes in the building's position, modern krypton- or argon-insulated windows permit normal-looking windows to provide passive solar heat without compromising insulation or structural strength. If a small heater is available for the coldest nights, a slab or basement cistern can inexpensively provide the required thermal mass. Passivhaus building codes, in particular, bring unusually good interior air quality, because the buildings change the air several times per hour, passing it through a heat exchanger to keep heat inside.\nIn all systems, a small supplementary heater increases personal security and reduces lifestyle impacts for a small reduction of autonomy. The two most popular heaters for ultra-high-efficiency houses are a small heat pump, which also provides air conditioning, or a central hydronic (radiator) air heater with water recirculating from the water heater. Passivhaus designs usually integrate the heater with the ventilation system.\nEarth sheltering and windbreaks can also reduce the absolute amount of heat needed by a building. Several feet below the earth, temperature ranges from in North Dakota to , in Southern Florida. Wind breaks reduce the amount of heat carried away from a building.\nRounded, aerodynamic buildings also lose less heat.\nAn increasing number of commercial buildings use a combined cycle with cogeneration to provide heating, often water heating, from the output of a natural gas reciprocating engine, gas turbine or stirling electric generator.\nHouses designed to cope with interruptions in civil services generally incorporate a wood stove, or heat and power from diesel fuel or bottled gas, regardless of their other heating mechanisms.\nElectric heaters and electric stoves may provide pollution-free heat (depending on the power source), but use large amounts of electricity. If enough electricity is provided by solar panels, wind turbines, or other means, then electric heaters and stoves become a practical autonomous design.\nWater heating.\nHot water heat recycling units recover heat from water drain lines. They increase a building's autonomy by decreasing the heat or fuel used to heat water. They are attractive because they have no lifestyle changes.\nCurrent practical, comfortable domestic water-heating systems combine a solar preheating system with a thermostatic gas-powered flow-through heater, so that the temperature of the water is consistent, and the amount is unlimited. This reduces life-style impacts at some cost in autonomy.\nSolar water heaters can save large amounts of fuel. Also, small changes in lifestyle, such as doing laundry, dishes and bathing on sunny days, can greatly increase their efficiency. Pure solar heaters are especially useful for laundries, swimming pools and external baths, because these can be scheduled for use on sunny days.\nThe basic trick in a solar water heating system is to use a well-insulated holding tank. Some systems are vacuum- insulated, acting something like large thermos bottles. The tank is filled with hot water on sunny days, and made available at all times. Unlike a conventional tank water heater, the tank is filled only when there is sunlight. Good storage makes a smaller, higher-technology collector feasible. Such collectors can use relatively exotic technologies, such as vacuum insulation, and reflective concentration of sunlight.\nCogeneration systems produce hot water from waste heat. They usually get the heat from the exhaust of a generator or fuel cell.\nHeat recycling, cogeneration and solar pre-heating can save 50\u201375% of the gas otherwise used. Also, some combinations provide redundant reliability by having several sources of heat.\nSome authorities advocate replacing bottled gas or natural gas with biogas. However, this is usually impractical unless live-stock are on-site. The wastes of a single family are usually insufficient to produce enough methane for anything more than small amounts of cooking.\nCooling.\nAnnualized geo solar buildings often have buried, sloped water-tight skirts of insulation that extend from the foundations, to prevent heat leakage between the earth used as thermal mass, and the surface.\nLess dramatic improvements are possible. Windows can be shaded in summer. Eaves can be overhung to provide the necessary shade. These also shade the walls of the house, reducing cooling costs.\nAnother trick is to cool the building's thermal mass at night, perhaps with a whole-house fan and then cool the building from the thermal mass during the day. It helps to be able to route cold air from a sky-facing radiator (perhaps an air heating solar collector with an alternate purpose) or evaporative cooler directly through the thermal mass. On clear nights, even in tropical areas, sky-facing radiators can cool below freezing.\nIf a circular building is aerodynamically smooth, and cooler than the ground, it can be passively cooled by the \"dome effect.\" Many installations have reported that a reflective or light-colored dome induces a local vertical heat-driven vortex that sucks cooler overhead air downward into a dome if the dome is vented properly (a single overhead vent, and peripheral vents). Some people have reported a temperature differential as high as () between the inside of the dome and the outside. Buckminster Fuller discovered this effect with a simple house design adapted from a grain silo, and adapted his Dymaxion house and geodesic domes to use it.\nRefrigerators and air conditioners operating from the waste heat of a diesel engine exhaust, heater flue or solar collector are entering use. These use the same principles as a gas refrigerator. Normally, the heat from a flue powers an \"absorptive chiller\". The cold water or brine from the chiller is used to cool air or a refrigerated space.\nCogeneration is popular in new commercial buildings. In current cogeneration systems small gas turbines or stirling engines powered from natural gas produce electricity and their exhaust drives an absorptive chiller.\nA truck trailer refrigerator operating from the waste heat of a tractor's diesel exhaust was demonstrated by NRG Solutions, Inc. NRG developed a hydronic ammonia gas heat exchanger and vaporizer, the two essential new, not commercially available components of a waste heat driven refrigerator.\nA similar scheme (multiphase cooling) can be by a multistage evaporative cooler. The air is passed through a spray of salt solution to dehumidify it, then through a spray of water solution to cool it, then another salt solution to dehumidify it again. The brine has to be regenerated, and that can be done economically with a low-temperature solar still. Multiphase evaporative coolers can lower the air's temperature by 50\u00a0\u00b0F (28\u00a0\u00b0C), and still control humidity. If the brine regenerator uses high heat, they also partially sterilise the air.\nIf enough electric power is available, cooling can be provided by conventional air conditioning using a heat pump.\nFood production.\nFood production has often been included in historic autonomous projects to provide security.\nSkilled, intensive gardening can support an adult from as little as 100 square meters of land per person,\npossibly requiring the use of organic farming and aeroponics. Some proven intensive, low-effort food-production systems include urban gardening (indoors and outdoors). Indoor cultivation may be set up using hydroponics, while outdoor cultivation may be done using permaculture, forest gardening, no-till farming, and do nothing farming.\nGreenhouses are also sometimes included. Sometimes they are also outfitted with irrigation systems or heat sink-systems which can respectively irrigate the plants or help to store energy from the sun and redistribute it at night (when the greenhouses starts to cool down)."}

{"id": "3027", "revid": "28481209", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3027", "title": "Anubis", "text": "Anubis or Inpu, Anpu in Ancient Egyptian (; , Egyptian: \"inpw\", Coptic: \"Anoup\") is the Greek name of the god of death, mummification, embalming, the afterlife, cemeteries, tombs, and the Underworld, in ancient Egyptian religion, usually depicted as a canine or a man with a canine head. Archeologists have identified Anubis's sacred animal as an Egyptian canid, the African golden wolf. The African wolf was formerly called the \"African golden jackal\", until a 2015 genetic analysis updated the taxonomy and the common name for the species. As a result, Anubis is often referred to as having a \"jackal\" head, but this \"jackal\" is now more properly called a \"wolf\".\nLike many ancient Egyptian deities, Anubis assumed different roles in various contexts. Depicted as a protector of graves as early as the First Dynasty (c. 3100 \u2013 c. 2890 BC), Anubis was also an embalmer. By the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055\u20131650 BC) he was replaced by Osiris in his role as lord of the underworld. One of his prominent roles was as a god who ushered souls into the afterlife. He attended the weighing scale during the \"Weighing of the Heart\", in which it was determined whether a soul would be allowed to enter the realm of the dead. Despite being one of the most ancient and \"one of the most frequently depicted and mentioned gods\" in the Egyptian pantheon, Anubis played almost no role in Egyptian myths.\nAnubis was depicted in black, a color that symbolized regeneration, life, the soil of the Nile River, and the discoloration of the corpse after embalming. Anubis is associated with his brother Wepwawet, another Egyptian god portrayed with a dog's head or in canine form, but with grey or white fur. Historians assume that the two figures were eventually combined. Anubis' female counterpart is Anput. His daughter is the serpent goddess Kebechet.\nName.\n\"Anubis\" is a Greek rendering of this god's Egyptian name. Before the Greeks arrived in Egypt, around the 7th century BC, the god was known as \"Anpu\" or \"Inpu.\" The root of the name in ancient Egyptian language means \"a royal child.\" \"Inpu\" has a root to \"inp,\" which means \"to decay.\" The god was also known as \"First of the Westerners,\" \"Lord of the Sacred Land,\" \"He Who is Upon his Sacred Mountain,\" \"Ruler of the Nine Bows,\" \"The Dog who Swallows Millions,\" \"Master of Secrets,\" \"He Who is in the Place of Embalming,\" and \"Foremost of the Divine Booth.\" The positions that he had were also reflected in the titles he held such as \"He Who Is upon His Mountain,\" \"Lord of the Sacred Land,\" \"Foremost of the Westerners,\" and \"He Who Is in the Place of Embalming.\" \nIn the Old Kingdom (c. 2686 BC \u2013 c. 2181 BC), the standard way of writing his name in hieroglyphs was composed of the sound signs inpw followed by a jackal over a \"\u1e25tp\" sign: i-n:p-w-C6 A new form with the jackal on a tall stand appeared in the late Old Kingdom and became common thereafter: i-n:p-w-E16\nAnubis' name \"jnpw\" was possibly pronounced [a.\u02c8na.p\u02b0a(w)], based on Coptic \"Anoup\" and the Akkadian transcription in the name &lt;ri-a-na-pa&gt; \"Reanapa\" that appears in Amarna letter EA 315. However, this transcription may also be interpreted as \"r\u02c1-nfr\", a name similar to that of Prince Ranefer of the Fourth Dynasty.\nHistory.\nIn Egypt's Early Dynastic period (c. 3100\u00a0\u2013 c. 2686 BC), Anubis was portrayed in full animal form, with a \"jackal\" head and body. A jackal god, probably Anubis, is depicted in stone inscriptions from the reigns of Hor-Aha, Djer, and other pharaohs of the First Dynasty. Since Predynastic Egypt, when the dead were buried in shallow graves, jackals had been strongly associated with cemeteries because they were scavengers which uncovered human bodies and ate their flesh. In the spirit of \"fighting like with like,\" a jackal was chosen to protect the dead, because \"a common problem (and cause of concern) must have been the digging up of bodies, shortly after burial, by jackals and other wild dogs which lived on the margins of the cultivation.\"\nIn the Old Kingdom, Anubis was the most important god of the dead. He was replaced in that role by Osiris during the Middle Kingdom (2000\u20131700 BC). In the Roman era, which started in 30 BC, tomb paintings depict him holding the hand of deceased persons to guide them to Osiris.\nThe parentage of Anubis varied between myths, times and sources. In early mythology, he was portrayed as a son of Ra. In the Coffin Texts, which were written in the First Intermediate Period (c. 2181\u20132055 BC), Anubis is the son of either the cow goddess Hesat or the cat-headed Bastet. Another tradition depicted him as the son of Ra and Nephthys. The Greek Plutarch (c. 40\u2013120 AD) stated that Anubis was the illegitimate son of Nephthys and Osiris, but that he was adopted by Osiris's wife Isis:\nGeorge Hart sees this story as an \"attempt to incorporate the independent deity Anubis into the Osirian pantheon.\" An Egyptian papyrus from the Roman period (30\u2013380 AD) simply called Anubis the \"son of Isis.\"\nIn the Ptolemaic period (350\u201330 BC), when Egypt became a Hellenistic kingdom ruled by Greek pharaohs, Anubis was merged with the Greek god Hermes, becoming Hermanubis. The two gods were considered similar because they both guided souls to the afterlife. The center of this cult was in \"uten-ha\"/\"Sa-ka\"/ Cynopolis, a place whose Greek name means \"city of dogs.\" In Book XI of \"The Golden Ass\" by Apuleius, there is evidence that the worship of this god was continued in Rome through at least the 2nd century. Indeed, Hermanubis also appears in the alchemical and hermetical literature of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.\nAlthough the Greeks and Romans typically scorned Egyptian animal-headed gods as bizarre and primitive (Anubis was mockingly called \"Barker\" by the Greeks), Anubis was sometimes associated with Sirius in the heavens and Cerberus and Hades in the underworld. In his dialogues, Plato often has Socrates utter oaths \"by the dog\" (Greek: \"kai me ton kuna\"), \"by the dog of Egypt\", and \"by the dog, the god of the Egyptians\", both for emphasis and to appeal to Anubis as an arbiter of truth in the underworld.\nRoles.\nProtector of tombs.\nIn contrast to real wolves, Anubis was a protector of graves and cemeteries. Several epithets attached to his name in Egyptian texts and inscriptions referred to that role. \"Khenty-Amentiu\", which means \"foremost of the westerners\" and was also the name of a different canine funerary god, alluded to his protecting function because the dead were usually buried on the west bank of the Nile. He took other names in connection with his funerary role, such as \"tpy-\u1e0fw.f\" (Tepy-djuef) \"He who is upon his mountain\" (i.e. keeping guard over tombs from above) and \"nb-t3-\u1e0fsr\" (Neb-ta-djeser) \"Lord of the sacred land\", which designates him as a god of the desert necropolis.\nThe Jumilhac papyrus recounts another tale where Anubis protected the body of Osiris from Set. Set attempted to attack the body of Osiris by transforming himself into a leopard. Anubis stopped and subdued Set, however, and he branded Set's skin with a hot iron rod. Anubis then flayed Set and wore his skin as a warning against evil-doers who would desecrate the tombs of the dead. Priests who attended to the dead wore leopard skin in order to commemorate Anubis' victory over Set. The legend of Anubis branding the hide of Set in leopard form was used to explain how the leopard got its spots.\nMost ancient tombs had prayers to Anubis carved on them.\nEmbalmer.\nAs \"jmy-wt\" (Imiut or the Imiut fetish) \"He who is in the place of embalming\", Anubis was associated with mummification. He was also called \"\u1e2bnty z\u1e25-n\u1e6fr\" \"He who presides over the god's booth\", in which \"booth\" could refer either to the place where embalming was carried out or the pharaoh's burial chamber.\nIn the Osiris myth, Anubis helped Isis to embalm Osiris. Indeed, when the Osiris myth emerged, it was said that after Osiris had been killed by Set, Osiris's organs were given to Anubis as a gift. With this connection, Anubis became the patron god of embalmers; during the rites of mummification, illustrations from the \"Book of the Dead\" often show a wolf-mask-wearing priest supporting the upright mummy.\nGuide of souls.\nBy the late pharaonic era (664\u2013332 BC), Anubis was often depicted as guiding individuals across the threshold from the world of the living to the afterlife. Though a similar role was sometimes performed by the cow-headed Hathor, Anubis was more commonly chosen to fulfill that function. Greek writers from the Roman period of Egyptian history designated that role as that of \"psychopomp\", a Greek term meaning \"guide of souls\" that they used to refer to their own god Hermes, who also played that role in Greek religion. Funerary art from that period represents Anubis guiding either men or women dressed in Greek clothes into the presence of Osiris, who by then had long replaced Anubis as ruler of the underworld.\nWeighing of the heart.\nOne of the roles of Anubis was as the \"Guardian of the Scales.\" The critical scene depicting the weighing of the heart, in the \"Book of the Dead\", shows Anubis performing a measurement that determined whether the person was worthy of entering the realm of the dead (the underworld, known as \"Duat\"). By weighing the heart of a deceased person against Ma'at (or \"truth\"), who was often represented as an ostrich feather, Anubis dictated the fate of souls. Souls heavier than a feather would be devoured by Ammit, and souls lighter than a feather would ascend to a heavenly existence.\nPortrayal in art.\nAnubis was one of the most frequently represented deities in ancient Egyptian art. He is depicted in royal tombs as early as the First Dynasty. The god is typically treating a king's corpse, providing sovereign to mummification rituals and funerals, or standing with fellow gods at the Weighing of the Heart of the Soul in the Hall of Two Truths. One of his most popular representations is of him, with the body of a man and the head of a jackal with pointed ears, standing or kneeling, holding a gold scale while a heart of the soul is being weighed against Ma'at's white truth feather.\nIn the early dynastic period, he was depicted in animal form, as a black canine. Anubis's distinctive black color did not represent the animal, rather it had several symbolic meanings. It represented \"the discolouration of the corpse after its treatment with natron and the smearing of the wrappings with a resinous substance during mummification.\" Being the color of the fertile silt of the River Nile, to Egyptians, black also symbolized fertility and the possibility of rebirth in the afterlife. In the Middle Kingdom, Anubis was often portrayed as a man with the head of a jackal. An extremely rare depiction of him in fully human form was found in the tomb of Ramesses II in Abydos.\nAnubis is often depicted wearing a ribbon and holding a \"n\u1e2b3\u1e2b3\" \"flail\" in the crook of his arm. Another of Anubis's attributes was the \"jmy-wt\" or imiut fetish, named for his role in embalming.\nIn funerary contexts, Anubis is shown either attending to a deceased person's mummy or sitting atop a tomb protecting it. New Kingdom tomb-seals also depict Anubis sitting atop the nine bows that symbolize his domination over the enemies of Egypt.\nWorship.\nAlthough he does not appear in many myths, he was extremely popular with Egyptians and those of other cultures. The Greeks linked him to their god Hermes, the god who guided the dead to the afterlife. The pairing was later known as Hermanubis. Anubis was heavily worshipped because, despite modern beliefs, he gave the people hope. People marveled in the guarantee that their body would be respected at death, their soul would be protected and justly judged.\nAnubis had male priests who sported wood masks with the god's likeness when performing rituals. His cult center was at Cynopolis in Upper Egypt but memorials were built everywhere and he was universally revered in every part of the land.\nIn popular culture.\nIn popular and media culture, Anubis is often falsely portrayed as the sinister god of the dead. He gained popularity during the 20th and 21st centuries through books, video games, and movies where artists would give him evil powers and a dangerous army. Despite his nefarious reputation, his image is still the most recognizable of the Egyptian gods and replicas of his statues and paintings remain popular."}

He was a professor of educational psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. Jensen was known for his work in psychometrics and differential psychology, the study of how and why individuals differ behaviorally from one another.\nHe was a major proponent of the hereditarian position in the nature and nurture debate, the position that genetics play a significant role in behavioral traits, such as intelligence and personality. He was the author of over 400 scientific papers published in refereed journals and sat on the editorial boards of the scientific journals \"Intelligence\" and \"Personality and Individual Differences\".\nJensen was controversial, largely for his conclusions regarding the causes of race-based differences in IQ. A 2019 study found him to be the most controversial intelligence researcher among 55 persons covered.\nEarly life.\nJensen was born August 24, 1923, in San Diego, California, the son of Linda Mary (n\u00e9e Schachtmayer) and Arthur Alfred Jensen, who operated and owned a lumber and building materials company. His paternal grandparents were Danish immigrants and his mother was of half Polish Jewish and half German descent.\nAs a child, Jensen was interested in herpetology and classical music, playing clarinet in the San Diego Symphony orchestra.\nHe studied at University of California, Berkeley (B.A. 1945), San Diego State College (M.A., 1952) and Columbia University (Ph.D., 1956), and did his doctoral thesis with Percival Symonds on the Thematic Apperception Test. From 1956 through 1958, he did postdoctoral research at the University of London, Institute of Psychiatry with Hans Eysenck.\nUpon returning to the United States, he became a researcher and professor at the University of California, Berkeley, where he focused on individual differences in learning, especially the influences of culture, development, and genetics on intelligence and learning. He received tenure at Berkeley in 1962 and was given his first sabbatical in 1964. He concentrated much of his work on the learning difficulties of culturally disadvantaged students.\nJensen had a lifelong interest in classical music and was, early in his life, attracted by the idea of becoming a conductor himself. At 14, he conducted a band that won a nationwide contest held in San Francisco. Later, he conducted orchestras and attended a seminar given by Nikolai Sokoloff. Soon after graduating from Berkeley, he moved to New York, mainly to be near the conductor Arturo Toscanini. He was also deeply interested in the life and example of Gandhi, producing an unpublished book-length manuscript on his life. During Jensen's period in San Diego he spent time working as a social worker with the San Diego Department of Public Welfare.\nIQ and academic achievement.\nJensen's interest in learning differences directed him to the extensive testing of school children. The results led him to distinguish between two separate types of learning ability. \"Level I\", or associative learning, may be defined as retention of input and rote memorization of simple facts and skills. \"Level II\", or conceptual learning, is roughly equivalent to the ability to manipulate and transform inputs, that is, the ability to solve problems.\nLater, Jensen was an important advocate in the mainstream acceptance of the general factor of intelligence, a concept which was essentially synonymous with his \"Level II\" conceptual learning. The general factor, or \"g\", is an abstraction that stems from the observation that scores on all forms of cognitive tests correlate positively with one another.\nJensen claimed, on the basis of his research, that general cognitive ability is essentially an inherited trait, determined predominantly by genetic factors rather than by environmental conditions. He also contended that while associative learning, or memorizing ability, is equally distributed among the races, conceptual learning, or synthesizing ability, occurs with significantly greater frequency in whites than in non-whites.\nJensen's most controversial work, published in February 1969 in the \"Harvard Educational Review\", was titled \"How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?\" It concluded, among other things, that Head Start programs designed to boost African-American IQ scores had failed, and that this was likely never to be remedied, largely because, in Jensen's estimation, 80% of the variance in IQ in the population studied was the result of genetic factors and the remainder was due to environmental influences.\nThe work became one of the most cited papers in the history of psychological testing and intelligence research, although a large number of citations consisted of rebuttals of Jensen's work, or references to it as an example of a controversial paper.\nAfter the paper was released, large protests were held, demanding that Jensen be fired. Jensen's car tires were slashed, the university police provided him with plain-clothes bodyguards, and he and his family received threats that were considered so realistic by the police that they temporarily left their house. Jensen was spat on and was prevented from delivering lectures by disruptive protests. The editorial board of the \"Harvard Educational Review\" for a time refused to let him have reprints of his article, and said that they had not solicited the section on racial differences; Jensen later provided correspondence in which the board had requested he do so.\nIn a later article, Jensen argued that his claims had been misunderstood:\nAlthough a critic of Jensen's thesis, economist Thomas Sowell, criticizing the taboo against research on race and intelligence, wrote:\nHowever, Jensen's 1998 \"\" gives his position suggesting a genetic component is implicated in the white-black difference in IQ. In Chapter 12: Population Differences in \"g\": Causal Hypotheses, Jensen writes:\nIn 1994 he was one of 52 signatories on \"Mainstream Science on Intelligence, \" an editorial written by Linda Gottfredson and published in \"The Wall Street Journal\", which declared the consensus of the signing scholars on the meaning and significance of IQ following the publication of the book \"The Bell Curve\". Jensen received $1.1 million from the Pioneer Fund,\nan organization frequently described as racist and white supremacist in nature.\nThe fund contributed a total of $3.5 million to researchers cited in The Bell Curve's most controversial chapter \"that suggests some races are naturally smarter than others\" with Jensen's works being cited twenty-three times in the book's bibliography.\nIn 2005, Jensen's article, co-written with J. Philippe Rushton, named \"Thirty Years of Research on Race Differences in Cognitive Ability\", was published in the APA journal \"Psychology, Public Policy, and Law\". Jensen and Rushton present ten categories of evidence in support of the notion that IQ differences between whites and blacks are partly genetic in origin.\nDeath.\nHe died on October 22, 2012 at his home in Kelseyville, California at age 89.\nAssessment.\nSupport.\nPaul E. Meehl of the University of Minnesota, after being honored by the APA, wrote that Jensen's \"contributions, in both quality and quantity, certainly excelled mine\" and that he was \"embarrassed\" and \"distress[ed]\" that APA refused to honor Jensen because of his ideology.\nSandra Scarr of Yale University wrote that Jensen possessed an \"uncompromising personal integrity\" and set the standard for \"honest psychological science\". She contrasted him and his work favorably to some of his critics, who she called \"politically driven liars, who distort scientific facts in a misguided and condescending effort to protect an impossible myth about human equality\".\nSteven J. Haggbloom, writing for \"Review of General Psychology\" in 2002, rated Jensen as one of the 100 most eminent psychologists of the 20th century, based on six different metrics chosen by Haggbloom.\nFrancis Crick, the co-discoverer of DNA, considered that there was \"much substance to Jensen's arguments\" and that it was \"likely that more than half the difference between the average I.Q. of American whites and Negroes is due to genetic reasons, and will not be eliminated by any foreseeable change in the environment.\"\nIn 1980 Jensen published a detailed book in defense of the tests used to measure mental abilities, entitled \"Bias in Mental Testing\". Reviewing this book, psychologist Kenneth Kaye endorsed Jensen's distinction between bias and discrimination, saying that he found many of Jensen's opponents to be more politically biased than Jensen was.\nCriticism.\nMelvin Konner of Emory University, wrote:\nLisa Suzuki and Joshua Aronson of New York University wrote that Jensen had largely ignored evidence which failed to support his position that IQ test score gaps represent genetic racial differences.\nPaleontologist and evolutionary biologist Stephen Jay Gould criticized Jensen's work in his 1981 book \"The Mismeasure of Man\". Gould writes that Jensen misapplies the concept of \"heritability\", which is defined as a measure of the variation of a trait due to inheritance \"within\" a population (Gould 1981: 127; 156\u2013157). According to Gould, Jensen uses heritability to measure differences \"between\" populations. Gould also disagrees with Jensen's belief that IQ tests measure a real variable, \"g\", or \"the general factor common to a large number of cognitive abilities\" which can be measured along a unilinear scale. This is a claim most closely identified with Charles Spearman. According to Gould, Jensen misunderstood the research of L. L. Thurstone to ultimately support this claim; Gould, however, argues that Thurstone's factor analysis of intelligence revealed \"g\" to be an illusion (1981: 159; 13-314). Gould criticizes Jensen's sources including his use of Catharine Cox's 1926 \"Genetic Studies of Genius\", which examines historiometrically the IQs of historic intellectuals after their deaths (Gould 1981: 153\u2013154).\nNeutral responses.\nAccording to David Lubinski of Vanderbilt University, the \"extent to which [Jensen's] work was either admired or reviled by many distinguished scientists is unparalleled.\"\nAfter Jensen's death, James Flynn of the University of Otago, a prominent advocate of the environmental position, told \"The New York Times\" that Jensen was without racial bias and had not initially foreseen that his research would be used to argue for racial supremacy and that his career was \"emblematic of the extent to which American scholarship is inhibited by political orthodoxy\", though he noted that Jensen shifted towards genetic explanations later in life.\nJensen's response and criticism.\nIn Arthur Jensen's response to Gould's criticisms, in the paper titled \"The Debunking of Scientific Fossils and Straw Persons\", Jensen begins his paper with this observation:\nWhile Jensen recognizes the validity of some of Gould's claims, in many places, he criticizes Gould's general approach:\nJensen adds that Gould made a number of misrepresentations, whether intentional or unintentional, while purporting to present Jensen's own positions:\nJensen expressed considerably greater praise of his frequent intellectual sparring partner, James R. Flynn:\nBooks.\n\"Bias in Mental Testing\".\n\"Bias in Mental Testing\" (1980) is a book examining the question of test bias in commonly used standardized tests. The book runs almost 800 pages and has been called \"exhaustive\" by three researchers who reviewed the field 19 years after the book's publication. It reviewed in detail the available evidence about test bias across major US racial/ethnic groups. Jensen concluded that \"the currently most widely used standardized tests of mental ability -- IQ, scholastic aptitude, and achievement tests -- are, by and large, not biased against any of the native-born English-speaking minority groups on which the amount of research evidence is sufficient for an objective determination of bias, if the tests were in fact biased. For most nonverbal standardized tests, this generalization is not limited to English-speaking minorities.\" (p. ix). Jensen also published a summary of the book the same year which was a target article in the journal \"Behavioral and Brain Sciences\" to which 27 commentaries were printed along with the author's reply.\n\"Straight Talk about Mental Tests\".\n\"Straight Talk about Mental Tests\" (1981) is a book written about psychometrics for the general public. John B. Carroll reviewed it favorably in 1982, saying it was a useful summary of the issues, as did Paul Cline writing for the \"British Journal of Psychiatry\". In 2016, Richard J. Haier called it \"a clear examination of all issues surrounding mental testing\".\n\"The g Factor\".\n\"\" (1998) is a book on the general intelligence factor (\"g\"). The book deals with the intellectual history of g and various models of how to conceptualize intelligence, and with the biological correlates of g, its heritability, and its practical predictive power.\n\"Clocking the Mind\".\n\"Clocking the Mind: Mental Chronometry and Individual Differences\" (2006) deals with mental chronometry (MC), and covers the speed with which the brain processes information and different ways this is measured. Jensen argues mental chronometry represents a true natural science of mental ability, which is in contrast to IQ, which merely represents an interval (ranking) scale and thus possesses no true ratio scale properties.\nJoseph Glicksohn wrote in a 2007 review for \"Canadian Journal of Experimental Psychology\" that \"The book should be perused with care in order to ensure the further profitable use of [reaction time] in both experimental and differential lines of research.\"\nDouglas Detterman reviewed it in 2008 for \"Intelligence\", writing that \"the book would make a good introduction to the field of the measurement of individual differences in cognitive tasks for beginning graduate students.\" Eric-Jan Wagenmakers and Han van der Mass, also writing for \"Intelligence\" in 2018, faulted the book for omitting the work by mathematical psychologists, advocating standardization of chronometric methods (which the authors consider problematic because it can hide method variance), and because it does not discuss topics such as the mutualism model of the \"g-\"factor and the Flynn effect. They describe the book's breadth as useful, despite its simplistic approach. Jensen was on the editorial board of \"Intelligence\" when these reviews were published.\nAwards.\nIn 2003, Jensen was awarded the Kistler Prize for original contributions to the understanding of the connection between the human genome and human society.

{"id": "3032", "revid": "1015784434", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3032", "title": "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum", "text": "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum is a musical with music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim and book by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart.\nInspired by the farces of the ancient Roman playwright Plautus (251\u2013183 BC), specifically \"Pseudolus\", \"Miles Gloriosus\", and \"Mostellaria\", the musical tells the bawdy story of a slave named Pseudolus and his attempts to win his freedom by helping his young master woo the girl next door. The plot displays many classic elements of farce, including puns, the slamming of doors, cases of mistaken identity (frequently involving characters disguising themselves as one another), and satirical comments on social class. The title derives from a line often used by vaudeville comedians to begin a story: \"A funny thing happened on the way to the theater\".\nThe musical's original 1962 Broadway run won several Tony Awards, including Best Musical and Best Author (Musical). \"A Funny Thing\" has enjoyed several Broadway and West End revivals and was made into a successful film starring the original lead of the stage musical, Zero Mostel.\nProductions.\nOriginal Broadway.\n\"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" opened on Broadway on May 8, 1962, at the Alvin Theatre, and then transferred to the Mark Hellinger Theatre and the Majestic Theatre, where the show closed on August 29, 1964, after 964 performances and 8 previews.\nThe show's creators originally wanted Phil Silvers in the lead role of Pseudolus, but he turned them down, allegedly because he would have to perform onstage without his glasses, and his vision was so poor that he feared tripping into the orchestra pit. He is also quoted as turning down the role for being \"Sgt. Bilko in a toga\". (Silvers eventually played the role \u2014 wearing his glasses \u2014 in a 1972 revival. In the film, he played Marcus Lycus.) Milton Berle also passed on the role. Eventually, Zero Mostel was cast.\nDuring the out of town pre-Broadway tryouts the show was attracting little business and not playing well. Jerome Robbins was called in to give advice and make changes. The biggest change Robbins made was a new opening number to replace \"Love Is in the Air\" and introduce the show as a bawdy, wild comedy. Stephen Sondheim wrote the song \"Comedy Tonight\" for this new opening. From that point on, the show was a success.\nIt was directed by George Abbott and produced by Hal Prince, with choreography by Jack Cole and uncredited staging and choreography by Robbins. The scenic and costume design was by Tony Walton. This wardrobe is on display at the Costume World Broadway Collection in Pompano Beach, Florida. The lighting design was by Jean Rosenthal. Along with Mostel, the musical featured a cast of seasoned performers, including Jack Gilford (Mostel's friend and fellow blacklist member), David Burns, John Carradine, Ruth Kobart, and Raymond Walburn. The young lovers were played by Brian Davies and Preshy Marker. Karen Black, originally cast as the ingenue, was replaced out of town.\nThe show won several Tony Awards: Best Musical, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actor (Burns), Best Book, and Best Director. The score, however, was coolly received; it was Sondheim's first musical on Broadway in which he wrote both the music and lyrics, and did not earn a nomination for Best Original Score.\nLondon.\nThe show was presented twice in London's West End. The 1963 production and its 1986 revival were staged at the Strand Theatre and the Piccadilly Theatre respectively, and starred Frankie Howerd as Pseudolus and Leon Greene as Miles Gloriosus in both. In the 1963 production, Kenneth Connor appeared as Hysterium, 'Monsewer' Eddie Gray as Senex and Jon Pertwee as Marcus Lycus. In the 1986 revival, Patrick Cargill was Senex with Ronnie Stevens as Hysterium and Derek Royle as Erronius.\nIn 2004 there was a limited-run revival at the Royal National Theatre, starring Desmond Barrit as Pseudolus, Philip Quast as Miles Gloriosus, Hamish McColl as Hysterium and Isla Blair as Domina (who had previously played Philia in the 1963 production). This production was nominated for the 2005 Olivier Award, Outstanding Musical Production.\nMotion picture adaptation.\n\"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" was made into a musical film in 1966, directed by Richard Lester, with Mostel and Gilford re-creating their Broadway stage roles, Leon Greene reprising his West End stage role, and Phil Silvers in an expanded role as \"Marcus Lycus\". David Burns did not return for the film role of Senex, which was played in the film by Michael Hordern. Buster Keaton made his final film appearance in the role of Erronius.\nBroadway revivals.\nA revival opened on Broadway at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on April 4, 1972 and closed on August 12, 1972 after 156 performances. Directed by co-author Burt Shevelove the cast starred Phil Silvers as Pseudolus (later replaced by Tom Poston), Lew Parker as Senex, Carl Ballantine as Lycus and Reginald Owen as Erronius. Larry Blyden, who played Hysterium, the role created by Jack Gilford, also co-produced. \"Pretty Little Picture\" and \"That'll Show Him\" were dropped from the show, and were replaced with \"Echo Song\" (sung by Hero and Philia), and \"Farewell\" (added for Nancy Walker as Domina, as she and Senex depart for the country). \"Echo Song\" and \"Farewell\" had been added to a production staged in Los Angeles the previous year and were composed by Sondheim. They had to close soon after Phil Silvers suffered a stroke. The show won two Tony Awards, Best Leading Actor in a Musical for Silvers, and Best Featured Actor in a Musical for Blyden.\nThe musical was revived again with great success in 1996, opening at the St. James Theatre on April 18, 1996 and closing on January 4, 1998 after 715 performances. The cast starred Nathan Lane as Pseudolus (replaced by Whoopi Goldberg and later by David Alan Grier), Mark Linn-Baker as Hysterium, Ernie Sabella as Lycus, Jim Stanek as Hero, Lewis J. Stadlen as Senex, and Cris Groenendaal as Miles Gloriosus. The production was directed by Jerry Zaks, with choreography by Rob Marshall. Lane won the 1996 Tony Award for Best Leading Actor and the Drama Desk Award, Outstanding Actor in a Musical; the production was nominated for the 1996 Tony Award and Drama Desk Award, Revival of a Musical.\nEvery actor who has opened in the role of Pseudolus on Broadway (Zero Mostel, Phil Silvers, and Nathan Lane) has won a Best Leading Actor Tony Award for his performance. In addition, Jason Alexander, who performed as Pseudolus in one scene in \"Jerome Robbins' Broadway\", also won a Tony for Best Actor in a Musical.\nOther productions.\nThe original Australian production with American actor Jack Collins as Pseudolus opened at the Theatre Royal in Sydney in July 1964, and toured other Australian cities through 1965.\nIn 1998, Jon English starred as Pseudolus in Essgee Entertainment's production that opened New Year's Day at the State Theatre, Melbourne and toured Australia and New Zealand, closing September 1999.\nThe Stephen Sondheim Center for the Performing Arts produced a limited-run revival of the musical from January 11 to 27, 2008. The production was directed by Randal K. West, with Justin Hill as musical director and Adam Cates as choreographer. The cast featured Richard Kind as Pseudolus, Joel Blum as Senex, Stephen DeRosa as Marcus Lycus, Sean McCall as Hysterium, and Steve Wilson as Miles Gloriosus. It also featured Diana Upton-Hill, Ryan Gaffney, Stephen Mark Crisp, Jack Kloppenborg, and Margret Clair.\nThe Chung Ying Theatre Company in Hong Kong staged a Cantonese version of the musical at Kwai Tsing Theatre, to celebrate the company's 30th anniversary. It was directed by Chung King Fai and Ko Tin Lung and ran from 14 to 21 March 2009.\nThe Stratford Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Ontario, Canada production ran from June 11 to November 7, 2009, with Des McAnuff directing and Wayne Cilento as choreographer. Bruce Dow originally performed the role of Pseudolus, but was forced to withdraw from the entire 2009 season due to an injury, and the role was then performed by Se\u00e1n Cullen as of September 5, 2009. Stephen Ouimette played Hysterium. Mirvish Productions presented the earlier Stratford production at the Canon Theatre, Toronto, in December 2010 through January 2011. Bruce Dow and Sean Cullen were alternates in the lead role.\nIn October 2012 the play opened at Her Majesty's Theatre, Melbourne, Australia, with Geoffrey Rush as Pseudolus, Magda Szubanski as Domina and Shane Bourne as Senex.\n\"A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum\" was produced at the Two River Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey from November 14, 2015 to December 13, 2015 with an all-male cast (Paul Castree, Eddie Cooper, Kevin Isola, David Josefsberg, Max Kumangai, Graham Rowat, Manny Stark, Bobby Conte Thornton, David Turner, Michael Urie, Tom Deckman, and Christopher Fitzgerald).\nPlot.\nIn ancient Rome, some neighbors live in three adjacent houses. In the center is the house of Senex, who lives there with wife Domina, son Hero, and several slaves, including head slave Hysterium and the musical's main character Pseudolus. A slave belonging to Hero, Pseudolus wishes to buy, win, or steal his freedom. One of the neighboring houses is owned by Marcus Lycus, who is a buyer and seller of beautiful women; the other belongs to the ancient Erronius, who is abroad searching for his long-lost children (stolen in infancy by pirates).\nOne day, Senex and Domina depart on a visit to Domina's mother and leave Pseudolus in charge of Hero. Hero confides in Pseudolus that he is in love with the lovely Philia, one of the courtesans in the House of Lycus (albeit still a virgin). Pseudolus promises to help him win Philia's love in exchange for his own freedom. Unfortunately (as the two find out when they pay a visit on Lycus), Philia has been sold to the renowned warrior Miles Gloriosus, who is expected to claim her very soon. Pseudolus, an excellent liar, uses Philia's cheery disposition to convince Lycus that she has picked up a plague from Crete, which causes its victims to smile endlessly in its terminal stages. By offering to isolate her in Senex's house, he is able to give Philia and Hero some time alone together, and the two fall in love. But Philia insists that, even though she is in love with Hero, she must honor her contract with the Captain, for \"that is the way of a courtesan.\" To appease her, he tells her to wait (\"that's what virgins do best, isn't it?\") inside, and that he will have the captain knock three times when he arrives. Pseudolus comes up with a plan to slip Philia a sleeping potion that will render her unconscious. He will then tell Lycus that she has died of the Cretan plague, and will offer to remove the body. Hero will come along, and they will stow away on a ship headed for Greece. Satisfied with his plan, Pseudolus steals Hysterium's book of potions and has Hero read him the recipe for the sleeping potion; the only ingredient he lacks is \"mare's sweat\", and Pseudolus goes off in search of some.\nUnexpectedly, Senex returns home early from his trip, and knocks three times on his own door. Philia comes out of the house, and, thinking that Senex is the Captain, offers herself up to him. Surprised but game, Senex instructs Philia to wait in the house for him, and she does. Hysterium arrives to this confusion, and tells Senex that Philia is the new maid that he has hired. Pseudolus returns, having procured the necessary mare's sweat; seeing that Senex has returned unexpectedly and grasping the need to keep him out of the way, Pseudolus discreetly sprinkles some of the horse-sweat onto him, then suggests that the road trip has left Senex in dire need of a bath. Taking the bait, Senex instructs Hysterium to draw him a bath in the long-abandoned house of Erronius. But while this is happening, Erronius returns home, finally having given up the search for his long-lost children. Hysterium, desperate to keep him out of the house where his master is bathing, tells the old man that his house has become haunted \u2013 a story seemingly confirmed by the sound of Senex singing in his bath. Erronius immediately determines to have a soothsayer come and banish the spirit from his house, and Pseudolus obligingly poses as one, telling Erronius that, in order to banish the spirit, he must travel seven times around the seven hills of Rome (thus keeping the old man occupied and out of the way for quite a while).\nWhen Miles Gloriosus arrives to claim his courtesan-bride, Pseudolus hides Philia on the roof of Senex's house; told that she has \"escaped,\" Lycus is terrified to face the Captain's wrath. Pseudolus offers to impersonate Lycus and talk his way out of the mess but, his ingenuity flagging, he ends up merely telling the Captain that Philia has disappeared, and that he, \"Lycus\", will search for her. Displeased and suspicious, Miles insists that his soldiers accompany Pseudolus, but the wily slave loses them in Rome's winding streets.\nComplicating matters further, Domina returns from her trip early, suspicious that her husband Senex is \"up to something low.\" She disguises herself in virginal white robes and a veil (much like Philia's) to try to catch Senex being unfaithful. Pseudolus convinces Hysterium to help him by dressing in drag and pretending to be Philia, \"dead\" from the plague. Unfortunately, it turns out that Miles Gloriosus has just returned from Crete, where there is of course no actual plague. With the ruse thus revealed, the main characters run for their lives, resulting in a madcap chase across the stage with both Miles and Senex pursuing all three \"Philia\"s (Domina, Hysterium, and the actual Philia \u2013 all wearing identical white robes and veils). Meanwhile, the courtesans from the house of Marcus Lycus \u2013 who had been recruited as mourners at \"Philia\"'s ersatz funeral \u2013 have escaped, and Lycus sends his eunuchs out to bring them all back, adding to the general pandemonium.\nFinally, the Captain's troops are able to round everyone up. His plot thoroughly unraveled, Pseudolus appears to be in deep trouble \u2013 but Erronius, completing his third circuit of the Roman hills, shows up fortuitously to discover that Miles Gloriosus and Philia are wearing matching rings which mark them as his long-lost children. Philia's betrothal to the Captain is nullified by the unexpected revelation that he's her brother, and, as the daughter of a free-born citizen, she's freed from Marcus Lycus. Philia weds Hero; Pseudolus gets his freedom and the lovely courtesan Gymnasia; Gloriosus receives twin courtesans to replace Philia; and Erronius is reunited with his children. A happy ending prevails for all \u2013 except for poor Senex, stuck with his shrewish wife Domina.\nSongs.\nAct I\nAct II\nNotes: \nReferences.\nNotes\nBibliography"}

{"id": "3034", "revid": "21327649", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3034", "title": "Aleut", "text": "The Aleuts (; ), who are usually known in the Aleut language by the endonyms Unangan (eastern dialect), Unangas (western dialect), \u0423\u043d\u0430\u04c8\u0430\u043d (lit. \"people\", singular is Unangax\u0302), are the indigenous people of the Aleutian Islands.\nBoth the Aleut people and the islands are divided between the US state of Alaska and the Russian administrative division of Kamchatka Krai.\nLanguage.\nAleut people speak Unangam Tunuu, the Aleut language, as well as English and Russian in the United States and Russia respectively. An estimated 150 people in the United States and five people in Russia speak Aleut. The language belongs to the Eskimo-Aleut language family and includes three dialects: Eastern Aleut, spoken on the Eastern Aleutian, Shumagin, Fox and Pribilof Islands; Atkan, spoken on Atka and Bering islands; and the now extinct Attuan dialect.\nThe Pribilof Islands boast the highest number of active speakers of Unangam Tunuu. Most of the Native elders speak Aleut, but it is very rare for an everyday person to speak the language fluently.\nBeginning in 1829, Aleut was written in the Cyrillic script. From 1870, the language has been written in the Latin script. An Aleut dictionary and grammar have been published, and portions of the Bible were translated into Aleut.\nTribes.\nThe Aleut (Unangan) dialects and tribes:\nPopulation and distribution.\nThe Aleut people historically lived throughout the Aleutian Islands, the Shumagin Islands, and the far western part of the Alaska Peninsula, with an estimated population of around 25,000 prior to European contact. In the 1820s, the Russian-American Company administered a large portion of the North Pacific during a Russian-led expansion of the fur trade. They resettled many Aleut families to the Commander Islands (within the Aleutsky District of the Kamchatka Krai in Russia) and to the Pribilof Islands (in Alaska). These continue to have majority-Aleut communities.\nAccording to the 2000 Census, 11,941 people identified as being Aleut, while 17,000 identified as having partial Aleut ancestry. Prior to sustained European contact, approximately 25,000 Aleut lived in the archipelago. The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online says more than 15,000 people have Aleut ancestry in the early 21st century. The Aleut suffered high fatalities in the 19th and early 20th centuries from Eurasian infectious diseases to which they had no immunity. In addition, the population suffered as their customary lifestyles were disrupted. Russian traders and later Europeans married Aleut women and had families with them.\nHistory.\nAfter Russian contact.\nAfter the arrival of Russian Orthodox missionaries in the late 18th century, many Aleuts became Christian. Of the numerous Russian Orthodox congregations in Alaska, most are majority Alaska Native in ethnicity. One of the earliest Christian martyrs in North America was Saint Peter the Aleut.\nRecorded Uprising against the Russians.\nIn the 18th century, Russia \"promyshlenniki\" traders established settlements on the islands. There was high demand for the furs that the Aleut provided from hunting. In May 1784, local Aleuts revolted on Amchitka against the Russian traders. (The Russians had a small trading post there.) According to what Aleut people said, in an account recorded by Japanese castaways and published in 2004, otters were decreasing year by year. The Russians paid the Aleuts less and less in goods in return for the furs they made. The Japanese learned that the Aleuts felt the situation was at crisis. The leading Aleuts negotiated with the Russians, saying they had failed to deliver enough supplies in return for furs. Nezimov, leader of the Russians, ordered two of his men, Stephanov (\u30b9\u30c6\u30c3\u30d1\u30ce \"Suteppano\") and Kazhimov (\u30ab\u30b8\u30e2\u30d5 \"Kazimofu\") to kill his mistress Oniishin (\u30aa\u30cb\u30a4\u30b7\u30f3 \"Oniishin\"), who was the Aleut chief's daughter, because he doubted that Oniishin had tried to dissuade her father and other leaders from pushing for more goods.\nAfter the four leaders had been killed, the Aleuts began to move from Amchitka to neighboring islands. Nezimov, leader of the Russian group, was jailed after the whole incident was reported to Russian officials. (According to , written by Katsuragawa Hosh\u016b after interviewing Daikokuya K\u014dday\u016b.)\nAleut genocide against Nicole\u00f1o Tribe in California.\nAccording to Russian American Company (RAC) records translated and published in the Journal of California and Great Basin Anthropology, Vol. 34, No. 1 (2014), a 200-ton otter hunting ship named \"Il\u2019mena\" with a mixed-nationality crew, including a majority Aleut contingent, was involved in conflict resulting in a massacre of the indigenous natives of San Nicolas Island.\nIn 1811, to obtain more of the commercially valuable otter pelts, a party of Aleut hunters traveled to the coastal island of San Nicolas, near the Alta California-Baja California border. The locally resident Nicole\u00f1o nation sought a payment from the Aleut hunters for the large number of otters being killed in the area. Disagreement arose, turning violent; in the ensuing battle, the Aleut killed nearly all the Nicole\u00f1o men. Together with high fatalities from European diseases, the Nicole\u00f1os suffered so much from the loss of their men that by 1853, only one Nicole\u00f1an remained alive. (See Juana Maria, \"The Lone Woman of San Nicolas\", also known as Karana.)\nInternment during World War II.\nIn June 1942, during World War II, Japanese forces occupied Kiska and Attu Islands in the western Aleutians. They later transported captive Attu Islanders to Hokkaid\u014d, where they were held as prisoners of war in harsh conditions. Fearing a Japanese attack on other Aleutian Islands and mainland Alaska, the U.S. government evacuated hundreds more Aleuts from the western chain and the Pribilofs, placing them in internment camps in southeast Alaska, where many died of measles, influenza and other infectious diseases which spread quickly in the overcrowded dormitories. In total, about 75 died in American internment and 19 as a result of Japanese occupation. The Aleut Restitution Act of 1988 was an attempt by Congress to compensate the survivors. On June 17, 2017, the U.S. Government formally apologized for the internment of the Unangan people and their treatment in the camps.\nThe World War II campaign by the United States to retake Attu and Kiska was a significant component of the operations in the American and Pacific theaters.\nPopulation decline.\nBefore major influence from outside, there were approximately 25,000 Aleuts on the archipelago. Foreign diseases, harsh treatment and disruption of aboriginal society soon reduced the population to less than one-tenth this number. The 1910 Census count showed 1,491 Aleuts. In the 2000 Census, 11,941 people identified as being Aleut; nearly 17,000 said Aleuts were among their ancestors.\nCulture.\nHousing.\nThe Aleut constructed partially underground houses called \"barabara\". According to Lillie McGarvey, a 20th-century Aleut leader, \"barabaras\" keep \"occupants dry from the frequent rains, warm at all times, and snugly sheltered from the high winds common to the area\". Aleuts traditionally built houses by digging an oblong square pit in the ground, usually or smaller. The pit was then covered by a roof framed with driftwood, thatched with grass, then covered with earth for insulation. Inside trenches were dug along the sides, with mats placed on top to keep them clean. The bedrooms were at the back of the lodge, opposite the entrance. Several families would stay in one house, with their own designated areas. Rather than fireplaces or bonfires in the middle, lanterns were hung in the house.\nSubsistence.\nThe Aleut survived by hunting and gathering. They fished for salmon, crabs, shellfish, and cod, as well as hunting sea mammals such as seal, walrus, and whales. They processed fish and sea mammals in a variety of ways: dried, smoked, or roasted. Caribou, muskoxen, deer, moose, whale, and other types of game were eaten roasted or preserved for later use. They dried berries. They were also processed as \"alutiqqutigaq\", a mixture of berries, fat, and fish. The boiled skin and blubber of a whale is a delicacy, as is that of walrus.\nToday, many Aleut continue to eat customary and locally sourced foods but also buy processed foods from Outside, which is expensive in Alaska.\nEthnobotany.\nA full list of their ethnobotany can be found at http://naeb.brit.org/uses/tribes/5/ (65 documented plant uses).\nVisual arts.\nCustomary arts of the Aleut include weapon-making, building of \"baidarkas\" (special hunting boats), weaving, figurines, clothing, carving, and mask making. Men as well as women often carved ivory and wood. 19th-century craftsmen were famed for their ornate wooden hunting hats, which feature elaborate and colorful designs and may be trimmed with sea lion whiskers, feathers, and walrus ivory. Andrew Gronholdt of the Shumagin Islands has played a vital role in reviving the ancient art of building the \"chagudax\" or bentwood hunting visors.\nAleut women sewed finely stitched, waterproof parkas from seal gut and wove fine baskets from sea-lyme grass (\"Elymus mollis\"). Some Aleut women continue to weave ryegrass baskets. Aleut arts are practiced and taught throughout the state of Alaska. As many Aleut have moved out of the islands to other parts of the state, they have taken with them the knowledge of their arts. They have also adopted new materials and methods for their art, including serigraphy, video art, and installation art.\nAleut carving, distinct in each region, has attracted traders for centuries, including early Europeans and other Alaska Natives. Historically, carving was a male art and leadership attribute whereas today it is done by both genders. Most commonly the carvings of walrus ivory and driftwood originated as part of making hunting weapons. Sculptural carvings depict local animals, such as seals and whales. Aleut sculptors also have carved human figures.\nThe Aleut also carve walrus ivory for other uses, such as jewelry and sewing needles. Jewelry is made with designs specific to the region of each people. Each clan would have a specific style to signify their origin. Jewelry ornaments were made for piercing lips (labrum), nose, and ears, as well as for necklaces. Each woman had her own sewing needles, which she made, and that often had detailed end of animal heads.\nThe main Aleut method of basketry was false embroidery (overlay). Strands of grasses or reeds were overlaid upon the basic weaving surface, to obtain a plastic effect. Basketry was an art reserved for women. Early Aleut women created baskets and woven mats of exceptional technical quality, using only their thumbnail, grown long and then sharpened, as a tool. Today, Aleut weavers continue to produce woven grass pieces of a remarkable cloth-like texture, works of modern art with roots in ancient tradition. Birch bark, puffin feathers, and baleen are also commonly used by the Aleut in basketry. The Aleut term for grass basket is \"qiigam aygaaxsii\". One Aleut leader recognized by the State of Alaska for her work in teaching and reviving Aleut basketry was Anfesia Shapsnikoff. Her life and accomplishments are portrayed in the book \"Moments Rightly Placed\" (1998).\nMasks were created to portray figures of their myths and oral history. The Atka people believed that another people lived in their land before them. They portrayed such ancients in their masks, which show anthropomorphic creatures named in their language. Knut Bergsland says their word means \"like those found in caves.\" Masks were generally carved from wood and were decorated with paints made from berries or other natural products. Feathers were inserted into holes carved out for extra decoration. These masks were used in ceremonies ranging from dances to praises, each with its own meaning and purpose.\nTattoos and piercings.\nThe tattoos and piercings of the Aleut people demonstrated accomplishments as well as their religious views. They believed their body art would please the spirits of the animals and make any evil go away. The body orifices were believed to be pathways for the entry of evil entities. By piercing their orifices: the nose, the mouth, and ears, they would stop evil entities, \"khoughkh\", from entering their bodies. Body art also enhanced their beauty, social status, and spiritual authority.\nBefore the 19th century, piercings and tattoos were very common among the Aleut people, especially among women. Piercings, such as the nose pin, were common among both men and women and were usually performed a few days after birth. The ornament was made of various materials, a piece of bark or bone, or an eagle's feather shaft. From time to time, adult women decorated the nose pins by hanging pieces of amber and coral from strings on it; the semi-precious objects dangled down to their chins.\nPiercing ears was also very common. The Aleuts pierced holes around the rim of their ears with dentalium shells (tooth shells or tusk shells), bone, feathers, dried bird wings or skulls and/or amber. Materials associated with birds were important, as birds were considered to defend animals in the spirit world. A male would wear sea lion whiskers in his ears as a trophy of his expertise as a hunter. Worn for decorative reasons, and sometimes to signify social standing, reputation, and the age of the wearer, Aleuts would pierce their lower lips with walrus ivory and wear beads or bones. The individual with the most piercings held the highest respect.\nTattooing for women began when they reached physical maturity, after menstruation, at about age 20. Historically, men received their first tattoo after killing their first animal, an important rite of passage. Sometimes tattoos signaled social class. For example, the daughter of a wealthy, famous ancestor or father would work hard at her tattoos to show the accomplishments of that ancestor or father. They would sew, or prick, different designs on the chin, the side of the face, or under the nose.\nAleut clothing.\nThe Aleut people developed in one of the harshest climates in the world, and learned to create and protect warmth. Both men and women wore parkas that extended below the knees. The women wore the skin of seal or sea-otter, and the men wore bird skin parkas, the feathers turned in or out depending on the weather. When the men were hunting on the water, they wore waterproof parkas made from seal or sea-lion guts, or the entrails of bear, walrus, or whales. Parkas had a hood that could be cinched, as could the wrist openings, so water could not get in. Men wore breeches made from the esophageal skin of seals. Children wore parkas made of downy eagle skin with tanned bird skin caps. They called these parkas \"kameikas,\" meaning raingear in the English language.\nSea-lions, harbor seals, and the sea otters are the most abundant marine mammals. The men brought home the skins and prepared them by soaking them in urine and stretching them. The women undertook the sewing. Preparation of the gut for clothing involved several steps. The prepared intestines were turned inside out. A bone knife was used to remove the muscle tissue and fat from the walls of the intestine. The gut was cut and stretched, and fastened to stakes to dry. It was then cut and sewn to make waterproof parkas, bags, and other receptacles. On some hunting trips, the men would take several women with them. They would catch birds and prepare the carcasses and feathers for future use. They caught puffins (\"Lunda cirrhata\", \"Fratercula corniculata\"), guillemots, and murres.\nIt took 40 skins of tufted puffin and 60 skins of horned puffin to make one parka. A woman would need a year for all the labor to make one parka. Each lasted two years with proper care. All parkas were decorated with bird feathers, beard bristles of seal and sea-lion, beaks of sea parrots, bird claws, sea otter fur, dyed leather, and caribou hair sewn in the seams.\nWomen made needles from the wingbones of seabirds. They made thread from the sinews of different animals and fish guts. A thin strip of seal intestine could also be used, twisted to form a thread. The women grew their thumbnail extra long and sharpened it. They could split threads to make them as fine as a hair. They used vermilion paint, hematite, the ink bag of the octopus, and the root of a kind of grass or vine to color the threads.\nGender.\nRussian travelers making early contact with the Aleut mention traditional tales of two-spirits or third and fourth gender people, known as \"ayagigux\u0302\" (male-bodied, \"man transformed into a woman\") and \"tayagigux\u0302\" (female-bodied, \"woman transformed into a man\"), but it is unclear whether these tales are about historical individuals or spirits.\nHunting technologies.\nBoats.\nThe interior regions of the rough, mountainous Aleutian Islands provided little in terms of natural resources for the Aleutian people. They collected stones for weapons, tools, stoves or lamps. They collected and dried grasses for their woven baskets. For everything else, the Aleuts had learned to use the fish and mammals they caught and processed to satisfy their needs.\nTo hunt sea mammals and to travel between islands, the Aleuts became experts of sailing and navigation. While hunting, they used small watercraft called \"baidarkas.\" For regular travel, they used their large baidaras. \nThe baidara was a large, open, walrus-skin-covered boat. Aleut families used it when traveling among the islands. It was also used to transport goods for trade, and warriors took them to battle.\nThe baidarka (small skin boat) was a small boat covered in sea lion skin. It was developed and used for hunting because of its sturdiness and maneuverability. The Aleut baidarka resembles that of a Yup'ik kayak, but it is hydrodynamically sleeker and faster. They made the baidarka for one or two persons only. The deck was made with a sturdy chamber, the sides of the craft were nearly vertical and the bottom was rounded. Most one-man baidarkas were about long and wide, whereas a two-man was on average about long and wide. It was from the baidarka that Aleut men would stand on the water to hunt from the sea.\nWeapons.\nThe Aleuts hunted small sea mammals with barbed darts and harpoons slung from throwing boards. These boards gave precision as well as some extra distance to these weapons.\nHarpoons were also called throwing-arrows when the pointed head fit loosely into the socket of the foreshaft and the head was able to detach from the harpoon when it penetrated an animal, and remain in the wound. There were three main kinds of harpoon that the Aleuts used: a simple harpoon, with a head that kept its original position in the animal after striking, a compound (toggle-head) harpoon in which the head took a horizontal position in the animal after penetration, and the throwing-lance used to kill large animals.\nThe simple Aleut harpoon consisted of four main parts: the wooden shaft, the bone foreshaft, and the bonehead (tip) with barbs pointed backward. The barbed head was loosely fitted into the socket of the foreshaft so that when the animal was stabbed, it pulled the head away from the rest of the harpoon. The sharp barbs penetrated with ease, but could not be pulled out. The bone tip is fastened to a length of braided twine meanwhile; the hunter held the other end of the twine in his hand.\nThe compound harpoon was the most prevalent weapon of the Aleut people. Also known as the toggle-head spear, it was about the same size as the simple harpoon and used to hunt the same animals, however, this harpoon provided a more efficient and lethal weapon. This harpoon separated into four parts. The longest part was the shaft with the thicker stalk closer to the tip of the harpoon. The shaft was fitted into the socket of the fore shaft and a bone ring was then placed over the joint to hold the two pieces together, as well as, protecting the wooden shaft from splitting. Connected to the fore shaft of the harpoon is the toggle head spear tip. This tip was made of two sub shafts that break apart on impact with an animal. The upper sub shaft held the razor stone head and attached to the lower sub shaft with a small braided twine loop. Once the tip penetrates the animal the upper sub head broke off from the rest of the shaft, however, since it was still connected with the braided loop it rotated the head into a horizontal position inside the animal's body so that it could not get away from the hunter.\nThe throwing lance may be distinguished from a harpoon because of the fact that all its pieces are fixed and immovable. A lance was a weapon of war and it was also used to kill large marine animals after it has already been harpooned. The throwing lance usually consisted of three parts: a wooden shaft, a bone ring or belt, and the compound head that was made with a barbed bonehead and a stone tip. The length of the compound head was equivalent to the distance between the planes of a man's chest to his back. The lance would penetrate the chest and pass through the chest cavity and exit from the back. The bone ring was designed to break after impact so that the shaft could be used again for another kill.\nBurial practices.\nThey buried their dead ancestors near the village.\nArcheologists have found many different types of burials, dating from a variety of periods, in the Aleutian Islands. The Aleut developed a style of burials that were accommodated to local conditions, and honored the dead. They have had four main types of burials: \"umqan\", cave, above-ground sarcophagi, and burials connected to communal houses.\nUmqan burials are the most widely known type of mortuary practice found in the Aleutian Islands. The people created burial mounds, that tend to be located on the edge of a bluff. They placed stone and earth over the mound to protect and mark it. Such mounds were first excavated by archeologists in 1972 on Southwestern Unmak Island, and dated to the early contact period. Researchers have found a prevalence of these umqan burials, and concluded it is a regional mortuary practice. It may be considered a pan-Aleutian mortuary practice.\nCave burials have been found throughout the Eastern Aleutian Islands. The human remains are buried in shallow graves at the rear of the cave. These caves tend to be located next to middens and near villages. Some grave goods have been found in the caves associated with such burials. For example, a deconstructed boat was found in a burial cave on Kanaga Island. There were no other major finds of grave goods in the vicinity.\nThroughout the Aleutian Islands, gravesites have been found that are above-ground sarcophagi. These sarcophagi are left exposed, with no attempt to bury the dead in the ground. These burials tend to be isolated and limited to the remains of adult males, which may indicate a specific ritual practice. In the Near Islands, isolated graves have also been found with the remains, and not just the sarcophagus, left exposed on the surface. This way of erecting sarcophagi above ground is not as common as umqan and cave burials, but it is still widespread.\nAnother type of practice has been to bury remains in areas next to the communal houses of the settlement. Human remains are abundant in such sites. They indicate a pattern of burying the dead within the main activity areas of the settlement. These burials consist of small pits adjacent to the houses and scattered around them. In these instances, mass graves are common for women and children. This type of mortuary practice has been mainly found in the Near Islands.\nIn addition to these four main types, other kinds of burials have been found in the Aleutian Islands. These more isolated examples in include mummification, private burial houses, abandoned houses, etc. To date, such examples are not considered to be part of a larger, unifying cultural practice. The findings discussed represent only the sites that have been excavated.\nThe variety of mortuary practices mostly did not include the ritual of including extensive grave goods, as has been found in other cultures. The remains so far have been mainly found with other human and faunal remains. The addition of objects to \"accompany\" the dead is rare. Archaeologists have been trying to dissect the absence of grave goods, but their findings have been ambiguous and do not really help the academic community to understand these practices more.\nNot much information is known about the ritual parts of burying the dead. Archeologists and anthropologists have not found much evidence related to burial rituals. This lack of ritual evidence could hint at either no ritualized ceremony, or one that has not yet been revealed in the archaeological record. As a result, archaeologists cannot decipher the context to understand exactly why a certain type of burial was used in particular cases.\nIn popular culture.\nIn \"Snow Crash\", a science fiction novel by American writer Neal Stephenson, a central character named Raven is portrayed as an Aleut with incredible toughness and hunting skill. The story is about revenge due in part to perceived mistreatment of the Aleut.\n\"Alaska\" by James A. Michener."}
{"id": "3035", "revid": "27015025", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3035", "title": "Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act", "text": "The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) was signed into law by President Richard Nixon on December 18, 1971, constituting at the time the largest land claims settlement in United States history. ANCSA was intended to resolve long-standing issues surrounding aboriginal land claims in Alaska, as well as to stimulate economic development throughout Alaska.\nThe settlement established Alaska Native claims to the land by transferring titles to twelve Alaska Native regional corporations and over 200 local village corporations. A thirteenth regional corporation was later created for Alaska Natives who no longer resided in Alaska. The act is codified as 43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.\nBackground.\nWhen Alaska became a state in 1959, section 4 of the Alaska Statehood Act provided that any existing Alaska Native land claims would be unaffected by statehood and held in status quo. Yet while section 4 of the act preserved Native land claims until later settlement, section 6 allowed for the state government to claim lands deemed vacant. Section 6 granted the state of Alaska the right to select lands then in the hands of the federal government, with the exception of Native territory. As a result, nearly from the public domain would eventually be transferred to the state. The state government also attempted to acquire lands under section 6 of the Statehood Act that were subject to Native claims under section 4, and that were currently occupied and used by Alaska Natives. The federal Bureau of Land Management began to process the Alaska government's selections without taking into account the Native claims and without informing the affected Native groups.\nIt was against this backdrop that the original language for a land claims settlement was developed.\nA 9.2-magnitude earthquake struck the state in 1964. Recovery efforts drew the attention of the federal government The Federal Field Committee for Development Planning in Alaska decided that Natives should receive $100 million and 10% of revenue as a royalty. Nothing was done with this proposal, however, and a freeze on land transfers remained in effect.\nIn 1966, Emil Notti called for a statewide meeting inviting numerous leaders around Alaska to gather and create the first meeting of a committee. The historic meeting was held October 18, 1966 - on the 99th anniversary of the transfer of Alaska from Russia. Notti presided over the three-day conference as it discussed matters of land recommendations, claims committee's, and political challenges the act would have getting through congress. Many respected politicians and businessmen attended the meeting and delegates were astonished at the attention which they received from well-known political figures of the state. The growing presence and political importance of Natives was evidenced when association leaders were elected to the legislature. Members of the associated gathered and were able to gain seven of the sixty seats in the legislature. When the group met a second time early in 1967, it emerged with a new name, The Alaska Federation of Natives, and a new full-time President, Emil Notti. AFN changed the human rights and economic stability of the Alaska Native population forever.\nIn 1968, Governor Walter Hickel summoned a group of Native leaders to work out a settlement that would be satisfactory to Natives. The group met for ten days and asked for $20 million in exchange for requested lands. They also asked for 10% of federal mineral lease revenue.\nIn 1969, President Nixon appointed Hickel as Secretary of the Interior. The Alaska Federation of Natives (AFN) protested against Hickel's nomination, but he was eventually confirmed.\nHickel worked with the AFN, negotiating with Native leaders and state government over the disputed lands. Offers went back and forth, with each rejecting the other's proposals. The AFN wanted rights to land, while then-Governor Keith Miller believed Natives did not have legitimate claims to state land in light of the provisions of the Alaska Statehood Act.\nBut a succeeding Alaska state administration under Governor William A. Egan would stake out positions upon which the AFN and other stakeholders could largely agree. Native leaders, in addition to Alaska's congressional delegation and the state's newly elected Governor William A. Egan, eventually reached the basis for presenting an agreement to Congress. The proposed settlement terms faced challenges in both houses but found a strong ally in Senator Henry M. Jackson from Washington state. The most controversial issues that continued to hold up approval were methods for determining land selection by Alaska Natives and financial distribution.\nIn 1968, the Atlantic-Richfield Company discovered oil at Prudhoe Bay on the Arctic coast, catapulting the issue of land ownership into headlines. In order to lessen the difficulty of drilling at such a remote location and transporting the oil to the lower 48 states, the oil companies proposed building a pipeline to carry the oil across Alaska to the port of Valdez At Valdez, the oil would be loaded onto tankers and shipped to the contiguous states. The plan had been approved, but a permit to construct the pipeline, which would cross lands involved in the land claims dispute, could not be granted until the Native claims were settled.\nWith major petroleum dollars on the line, pressure mounted to achieve a definitive legislative resolution at the federal level. In 1971, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act was signed into law by President Nixon. It abrogated Native claims to aboriginal lands except those that are the subject of the law. In return, Natives received up to of land and were paid $963 million. The land and money were to be divided among regional, urban, and village tribal corporations established under the law, often recognizing existing leadership.\nEffect of land conveyances.\nIn 1971, barely one million acres of land in Alaska were in private hands. ANCSA, together with section 6 of Alaska Statehood Act, which the new act allowed to come to fruition, affected ownership to about of land in Alaska once wholly controlled by the federal government. That is larger by than the combined areas of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland and Virginia.\nWhen the bill passed in 1971, it included provisions that had never before been attempted in previous United States settlements with Native Americans. The newly passed Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act created twelve Native regional economic development corporations. Each corporation was associated with a specific region of Alaska and the Natives who had traditionally lived there. This innovative approach to native settlements engaged the tribes in corporate capitalism.\nThe idea originated with the AFN, who believed that the Natives would have to become a part of the capitalist system in order to survive. As stockholders in these corporations, the Natives could earn some income and stay in their traditional villages. If the corporations were managed properly, they could make profits that would enable individuals to stay, rather than having to leave Native villages to find better work. This was intended to help preserve Native culture.\nNative and state land selection.\nAlaska Natives had three years from passage of ANCSA to make land selections of the granted under the act. In some cases Native corporations received outside aid in surveying the land. For instance, Doyon, Limited (one of the 13 regional corporations) was helped by the Geophysical Institute of the University of Alaska. The Institute determined which land contained resources such as minerals and coal. NASA similarly provided satellite imagery to aid in Native corporations finding areas most suited for vegetation and their traditional subsistence culture. The imagery showed locations of caribou and moose, as well as forests with marketable timber. In total about were analyzed for Doyon. Natives were able to choose tens of thousands of acres of land rich with timber while Doyon used mineral analysis to attract businesses.\nThe state of Alaska to date has been granted approximately 85% or of the land claims it has made under ANCSA. The state is entitled to a total of under the terms of the Statehood Act. Originally the state had 25 years after passage of the Alaska Statehood Act to file claims under section 6 of the act with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Amendments to ANCSA extended that deadline until 1994, with the expectation that BLM would complete processing of land transfers subject to overlapping Native claims by 2009. Nonetheless, some Native and state selections under ANCSA remained unresolved as late as December 2014.\nCriticism of ANCSA.\nThere was largely positive reaction to ANCSA, although not entirely. The act was supported by Natives as well as non-Natives, and likewise enjoyed bipartisan support. Natives were heavily involved in the legislative process, and the final draft of the act used many AFN ideas.\nSome Natives have argued that ANCSA has hastened cultural genocide of Alaska Natives. Some Natives critiqued ANCSA as an illegitimate treaty since only tribal leaders were involved and the provisions of the act were not voted on by indigenous populations. One native described it as a social and political experiment. Critics have also argued that Natives so feared massacre or incarceration that they offered no resistance to the act.\nOthers have argued that the settlement was arguably the most generous afforded by the United States to a Native group. They note that some of the largest and most profitable corporations in the state are the twelve created by ANCSA. Other critics attacked the act as \"Native welfare\" and such complaints continue to be expressed.\nThe corporation system has been critiqued, as in some cases stockholders have sold land to outside corporations that have leveled forests and extracted minerals. But supporters of the system argue that it has provided economic benefits for indigenous peoples that outweigh these problems.\nSelected provisions of ANCSA.\nAlaska Native regional corporations.\nThe following thirteen regional corporations were created under ANCSA:\nAdditionally, most regions and some villages have created their own nonprofits providing social services and health care through grant funding and federal compacts. The objectives of these nonprofits are varied, but focus generally on cultural and educational activities. These include scholarships for Native students, sponsorship of cultural and artistic events, preservation efforts for Native languages, and protection of sites with historic or religious importance.\nAlaska Native village and urban corporations.\nANCSA created about 224 village and urban corporations. Below is a representative list of village and urban corporations created under ANCSA:"}
{"id": "3036", "revid": "37247652", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3036", "title": "Adoptionism", "text": "Adoptionism, also called dynamic monarchianism, is a Christian nontrinitarian theological doctrine which holds that Jesus was adopted as the Son of God at his baptism, his resurrection, or his ascension.\nDefinition.\nAdoptionism is one of two main forms of monarchianism (the other is modalism, which regards \"Father\" and \"Son\" as two historical or soteriological roles of a single divine Person). Adoptionism denies the eternal pre-existence of Christ, and although it explicitly affirms his deity subsequent to events in his life, many classical trinitarians claim that the doctrine implicitly denies it by denying the constant hypostatic union of the eternal Logos to the human nature of Jesus. Under adoptionism Jesus is currently divine and has been since his adoption, although he is not equal to the Father, per \"my Father is greater than I\" and as such is a kind of subordinationism. Adoptionism is sometimes, but not always, related to denial of the virgin birth of Jesus.\nHistory.\nEarly Christianity.\nAdoptionism and High Christology.\nBart Ehrman holds that the New Testament writings contain two different Christologies, namely a \"low\" or adoptionist Christology, and a \"high\" or \"incarnation Christology.\" The \"low Christology\" or \"adoptionist Christology\" is the belief \"that God exalted Jesus to be his Son by raising him from the dead,\" thereby raising him to \"divine status.\" The other early Christology is \"high Christology,\" which is \"the view that Jesus was a pre-existent divine being who became a human, did the Father\u2019s will on earth, and then was taken back up into heaven whence he had originally come,\" and from where he appeared on earth. The chronology of the development of these early Christologies is a matter of debate within contemporary scholarship.\nAccording to the \"evolutionary model\" c.q. \"evolutionary theories,\" as proposed by Bousset, followed by Brown, the Christological understanding of Christ developed over time, from a low Christology to a high Christology, as witnessed in the Gospels. According to the evolutionary model, the earliest Christians believed that Jesus was a human who was exalted, c.q. adopted as God's Son, when he was resurrected, signaling the nearness of the Kingdom of God, when all dead would be resurrected and the righteous exalted. Adoptionist concepts can be found in the Gospel of Mark, in which the birth of Jesus and the epithet \"Son of God\" are absent in some early manuscripts, suggesting that the concept of the Virgin Birth of Jesus had not been developed or elucidated at the time Mark was written. As Daniel Johansson notes, a majority consensus holds Mark's Jesus as \"an exalted, but merely human figure\", especially when read in the apparent context of Jewish beliefs. Later beliefs shifted the exaltation to his baptism, birth, and subsequently to the idea of his eternal existence, as witnessed in the Gospel of John. Mark shifted the moment of when Jesus became the son to the baptism of Jesus, and later still Matthew and Luke shifted it to the moment of the divine conception, and finally John declared that Jesus had been with God from the beginning: \"In the beginning was the Word\".\nSince the 1970s, the late datings for the development of a \"high Christology\" have been contested, and a majority of scholars argue that this \"High Christology\" existed already before the writings of Paul. This \"incarnation Christology\" or \"high Christology\" did not evolve over a longer time, but was a \"big bang\" of ideas which were already present at the start of Christianity, and took further shape in the first few decades of the church, as witnessed in the writings of Paul.\nAccording to Ehrman, these two Christologies existed alongside each other, calling the \"low Christology\" an \"adoptionist Christology, and \"the \"high Christology\" an \"incarnation Christology.\"\nNew Testamental epistles.\nAdoptionist theology may also be reflected in canonical epistles, the earliest of which pre-date the writing of the gospels. The letters of Paul the Apostle, for example, do not mention a virgin birth of Christ. Paul describes Jesus as \"born of a woman, born under the law\" and \"as to his human nature was a descendant of David\" in the Epistle to the Galatians and the Epistle to the Romans. Many interpreters, however, take his statements in Philippians 2 to imply that Paul believed Jesus to have existed as equal to God before his incarnation.\nThe Book of Hebrews, a contemporary sermon by an unknown author, describes God as saying \"You are my son; today I have begotten you.\" The latter phrase, a quote of Psalm 2:7, could reflect an early Adoptionist view.\nShepherd of Hermas.\nThe 2nd-century work Shepherd of Hermas may also have taught that Jesus was a virtuous man filled with the Holy Spirit and adopted as the Son. While the Shepherd of Hermas was popular and sometimes bound with the canonical scriptures, it didn't retain canonical status, if it ever had it.\nTheodotus of Byzantium.\nTheodotus of Byzantium (fl. late 2nd century), a Valentinian Gnostic, was the most prominent exponent of adoptionism. According to Hippolytus of Rome (\"Philosophumena\", VII, xxiii) Theodotus taught that Jesus was a man born of a virgin, according to the Council of Jerusalem, that he lived like other men, and was most pious. At his baptism in the Jordan the \"Christ\" came down upon the man Jesus, in the likeness of a dove (\"Philosophumena\", VII, xxiii), but Jesus was not himself God until after his resurrection.\nAdoptionism was declared heresy at the end of the 3rd century and was rejected by the Synods of Antioch and the First Council of Nicaea, which defined the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity and identified the man Jesus with the eternally begotten Son or Word of God in the Nicene Creed. The belief was also declared heretical by Pope Victor I.\nEbionites.\nAdoptionism was also adhered to by the Jewish Christians known as Ebionites, who, according to Epiphanius in the 4th century, believed that Jesus was chosen on account of his sinless devotion to the will of God.\nThe Ebionites were a Jewish Christian movement that existed during the early centuries of the Christian Era. They show strong similarities with the earliest form of Jewish Christianity, and their specific theology may have been a \"reaction to the law-free Gentile mission.\" They regarded Jesus as the Messiah while rejecting his divinity and his virgin birth, and insisted on the necessity of following Jewish law and rites. They used the Gospel of the Ebionites, one of the Jewish\u2013Christian gospels; the Hebrew Book of Matthew starting at chapter 3; revered James the brother of Jesus (James the Just); and rejected Paul the Apostle as an apostate from the Law. Their name ( \"Ebionaioi\", derived from Hebrew \"ebyonim\", \"ebionim\", meaning \"the poor\" or \"poor ones\") suggests that they placed a special value on voluntary poverty.\nDistinctive features of the \"Gospel of the Ebionites\" include the absence of the virgin birth and of the genealogy of Jesus; an Adoptionist Christology, in which Jesus is chosen to be God's Son at the time of his Baptism; the abolition of the Jewish sacrifices by Jesus; and an advocacy of vegetarianism.\nSpanish Adoptionism.\nSpanish Adoptionism was a theological position which was articulated in Umayyad and Christian-held regions of the Iberian peninsula in the 8th and 9th centuries. The issue seems to have begun with the claim of archbishop Elipandus of Toledo that \u2013 in respect to his human nature \u2013 Christ was \"adoptive\" Son of God. Another leading advocate of this Christology was Felix of Urgel. In Spain, adoptionism was opposed by Beatus of Liebana, and in the Carolingian territories, the Adoptionist position was condemned by Pope Hadrian I, Alcuin of York, Agobard, and officially in Carolingian territory by the Council of Frankfurt (794).\nDespite the shared name of \"adoptionism\" the Spanish Adoptionist Christology appears to have differed sharply from the adoptionism of early Christianity. Spanish advocates predicated the term \"adoptivus\" of Christ only in respect to his humanity; once the divine Son \"emptied himself\" of divinity and \"took the form of a servant\" (Philippians 2:7), Christ's human nature was \"adopted\" as divine.\nHistorically, many scholars have followed the Adoptionists' Carolingian opponents in labeling Spanish Adoptionism as a minor revival of \u201cNestorian\u201d Christology. John C. Cavadini has challenged this notion by attempting to take the Spanish Christology in its own Spanish/North African context in his study, \"The Last Christology of the West: Adoptionism in Spain and Gaul, 785\u2013820\".\nScholastic Neo-adoptionism.\nA third wave was the revived form (\"Neo-adoptionism\") of Peter Abelard in the 12th century. Later, various modified and qualified Adoptionist tenets emerged from some theologians in the 14th century. Duns Scotus (1300) and Durandus of Saint-Pour\u00e7ain (1320) admit the term \"Filius adoptivus\" in a qualified sense. In more recent times the Jesuit Gabriel V\u00e1squez, and the Lutheran divines Georgius Calixtus and Johann Ernst Immanuel Walch, have defended adoptionism as essentially orthodox.\nModern adoptionist groups.\nA form of adoptionism surfaced in Unitarianism during the 18th century as denial of the virgin birth became increasingly common, led by the views of Joseph Priestley and others.\nA similar form of adoptionism was expressed in the writings of James Strang, a Latter Day Saint leader who founded the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite) after the death of Joseph Smith in 1844. In his Book of the Law of the Lord, a purported work of ancient scripture found and translated by Strang, he offers an essay entitled \"Note on the Sacrifice of Christ\" in which he explains his unique (for Mormonism as a whole) doctrines on the subject. Jesus Christ, said Strang, was the natural-born son of Mary and Joseph, who was chosen from before all time to be the Savior of mankind, but who had to be born as an ordinary mortal of two human parents (rather than being begotten by the Father or the Holy Spirit) to be able to truly fulfill his Messianic role. Strang claimed that the earthly Christ was in essence \"adopted\" as God's son at birth, and fully revealed as such during the Transfiguration. After proving himself to God by living a perfectly sinless life, he was enabled to provide an acceptable sacrifice for the sins of men, prior to his resurrection and ascension."}

It was deemed heretical in 381 and virtually died out within the following decades.\nHistory.\nThe Trinity had been recognized at the Council of Nicea in 325, but debate about exactly what it meant continued. A rival to the more common belief that Jesus Christ had two natures was monophysitism (\"one nature\"), the doctrine that Christ had only one nature. Apollinarism and Eutychianism were two forms of monophysitism. Apollinaris' rejection that Christ had a human mind was considered an over-reaction to Arianism and its teaching that Christ was a lesser god. \nTheodoret charged Apollinaris with confounding the persons of the Godhead and with giving in to the heretical ways of Sabellius. Basil of Caesarea accused him of abandoning the literal sense of the scripture, and taking up wholly with the allegorical sense. His views were condemned in a Synod at Alexandria, under Athanasius of Alexandria, in 362, and later subdivided into several different heresies, the main ones of which were the Polemians and the Antidicomarianites.\nApollinaris, considering the rational soul or spirit as essentially liable to sin and capable, at its best, of only precarious efforts, saw no way of saving Christ's impeccability and the infinite value of Redemption, except by the elimination of the human spirit from Jesus' humanity, and the substitution of the Divine Logos in its stead. Apollinarism was declared to be a heresy in 381 by the First Council of Constantinople.\nChristian philosopher William Lane Craig has proposed a neo-Apollinarian Christology in which the divine Logos completes the human nature of Christ. Craig says his proposal is tentative and he welcomes critique and interaction from other scholars.\nCraig also clarifies his proposed neo-Apollinarian Christology with this statement. \"Against Apollinarius, I want to say that Christ did have a complete human nature. He was truly God and truly man. Therefore his death on our behalf as our representative before God was efficacious.\""}

It can be used to determine pH. Several theoretical frameworks provide alternative conceptions of the reaction mechanisms and their application in solving related problems; these are called the acid\u2013base theories, for example, Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid\u2013base theory.\nTheir importance becomes apparent in analyzing acid\u2013base reactions for gaseous or liquid species, or when acid or base character may be somewhat less apparent. The first of these concepts was provided by the French chemist Antoine Lavoisier, around 1776.\nIt is important to think of the acid-base reaction models as theories that complement each other. For example, the current Lewis model has the broadest definition of what an acid and base are, with the Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry theory being a subset of what acids and bases are, and the Arrhenius theory being the most restrictive.\nAcid\u2013base definitions.\nHistoric development.\nThe concept of an acid-base reaction was first proposed in 1754 by Guillaume-Fran\u00e7ois Rouelle, who introduced the word \"base\" into chemistry to mean a substance which reacts with an acid to give it solid form (as a salt).\nLavoisier's oxygen theory of acids.\nThe first scientific concept of acids and bases was provided by Lavoisier in around 1776. Since Lavoisier's knowledge of strong acids was mainly restricted to oxoacids, such as (nitric acid) and (sulfuric acid), which tend to contain central atoms in high oxidation states surrounded by oxygen, and since he was not aware of the true composition of the hydrohalic acids (HF, HCl, HBr, and HI), he defined acids in terms of their containing \"oxygen\", which in fact he named from Greek words meaning \"acid-former\" (from the Greek \u03bf\u03be\u03c5\u03c2 (\"oxys\") meaning \"acid\" or \"sharp\" and \u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 (\"geinomai\") meaning \"engender\"). The Lavoisier definition held for over 30 years, until the 1810 article and subsequent lectures by Sir Humphry Davy in which he proved the lack of oxygen in , H2Te, and the hydrohalic acids. However, Davy failed to develop a new theory, concluding that \"acidity does not depend upon any particular elementary substance, but upon peculiar arrangement of various substances\". One notable modification of oxygen theory was provided by J\u00f6ns Jacob Berzelius, who stated that acids are oxides of nonmetals while bases are oxides of metals.\nLiebig's hydrogen theory of acids.\nIn 1838, Justus von Liebig proposed that an acid is a hydrogen-containing compound whose hydrogen can be replaced by a metal. This redefinition was based on his extensive work on the chemical composition of organic acids, finishing the doctrinal shift from oxygen-based acids to hydrogen-based acids started by Davy. Liebig's definition, while completely empirical, remained in use for almost 50 years until the adoption of the Arrhenius definition.\nArrhenius definition.\nThe first modern definition of acids and bases in molecular terms was devised by Svante Arrhenius. A hydrogen theory of acids, it followed from his 1884 work with Friedrich Wilhelm Ostwald in establishing the presence of ions in aqueous solution and led to Arrhenius receiving the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1903.\nAs defined by Arrhenius:\nThis causes the protonation of water, or the creation of the hydronium (H3O+) ion. Thus, in modern times, the symbol H+ is interpreted as a shorthand for H3O+, because it is now known that a bare proton does not exist as a free species in aqueous solution.\nThe Arrhenius definitions of acidity and alkalinity are restricted to aqueous solutions, and refer to the concentration of the solvent ions. Under this definition, pure H2SO4 and HCl dissolved in toluene are not acidic, and molten NaOH and solutions of calcium amide in liquid ammonia are not alkaline. This led to the development of the Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry theory and subsequent Lewis theory to account for these non-aqueous exceptions.\nOverall, to qualify as an Arrhenius acid, upon the introduction to water, the chemical must either cause, directly or otherwise:\nConversely, to qualify as an Arrhenius base, upon the introduction to water, the chemical must either cause, directly or otherwise:\nThe reaction of an acid with a base is called a neutralization reaction. The products of this reaction are a salt and water.\nIn this traditional representation an acid\u2013base neutralization reaction is formulated as a double-replacement reaction. For example, the reaction of hydrochloric acid, HCl, with sodium hydroxide, NaOH, solutions produces a solution of sodium chloride, NaCl, and some additional water molecules.\nThe modifier (aq) in this equation was implied by Arrhenius, rather than included explicitly. It indicates that the substances are dissolved in water. Though all three substances, HCl, NaOH and NaCl are capable of existing as pure compounds, in aqueous solutions they are fully dissociated into the aquated ions H+, Cl\u2212, Na+ and OH\u2212.\nBr\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry definition.\nThe Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry definition, formulated in 1923, independently by Johannes Nicolaus Br\u00f8nsted in Denmark and Martin Lowry in England, is based upon the idea of protonation of bases through the deprotonation of acids \u2013 that is, the ability of acids to \"donate\" hydrogen ions (H+)\u2014otherwise known as protons\u2014to bases, which \"accept\" them.\nAn acid\u2013base reaction is, thus, the removal of a hydrogen ion from the acid and its addition to the base. The removal of a hydrogen ion from an acid produces its \"conjugate base\", which is the acid with a hydrogen ion removed. The reception of a proton by a base produces its \"conjugate acid\", which is the base with a hydrogen ion added.\nUnlike the previous definitions, the Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry definition does not refer to the formation of salt and solvent, but instead to the formation of \"conjugate acids\" and \"conjugate bases\", produced by the transfer of a proton from the acid to the base. In this approach, acids and bases are fundamentally different in behavior from salts, which are seen as electrolytes, subject to the theories of Debye, Onsager, and others. An acid and a base react not to produce a salt and a solvent, but to form a new acid and a new base. The concept of neutralization is thus absent. Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid\u2013base behavior is formally independent of any solvent, making it more all-encompassing than the Arrhenius model. The calculation of pH under the Arrhenius model depended on alkalis (bases) dissolving in water (aqueous solution). The Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry model expanded what could be pH tested using insoluble and soluble solutions (gas, liquid, solid).\nThe general formula for acid\u2013base reactions according to the Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry definition is:\nwhere HA represents the acid, B represents the base, BH+ represents the conjugate acid of B, and A\u2212 represents the conjugate base of HA.\nFor example, a Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry model for the dissociation of hydrochloric acid (HCl) in aqueous solution would be the following:\nThe removal of H+ from the HCl produces the chloride ion, Cl\u2212, the conjugate base of the acid. The addition of H+ to the H2O (acting as a base) forms the hydronium ion, H3O+, the conjugate acid of the base.\nWater is amphoteric\u2014that is, it can act as both an acid and a base. The Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry model explains this, showing the dissociation of water into low concentrations of hydronium and hydroxide ions:\nThis equation is demonstrated in the image below:\nHere, one molecule of water acts as an acid, donating an H+ and forming the conjugate base, OH\u2212, and a second molecule of water acts as a base, accepting the H+ ion and forming the conjugate acid, H3O+.\nAs an example of water acting as an acid, consider an aqueous solution of pyridine, C5H5N.\nIn this example, a water molecule is split into a hydrogen ion, which is donated to a pyridine molecule, and a hydroxide ion.\nIn the Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry model, the solvent does not necessarily have to be water, as is required by the Arrhenius Acid-Base model. For example, consider what happens when acetic acid, CH3COOH, dissolves in liquid ammonia.\nAn H+ ion is removed from acetic acid, forming its conjugate base, the acetate ion, CH3COO\u2212. The addition of an H+ ion to an ammonia molecule of the solvent creates its conjugate acid, the ammonium ion, .\nThe Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry model calls hydrogen-containing substances (like HCl) acids. Thus, some substances, which many chemists considered to be acids, such as SO3 or BCl3, are excluded from this classification due to lack of hydrogen. Gilbert N. Lewis wrote in 1938, \"To restrict the group of acids to those substances that contain hydrogen interferes as seriously with the systematic understanding of chemistry as would the restriction of the term oxidizing agent to substances containing oxygen.\" Furthermore, KOH and KNH2 are not considered Br\u00f8nsted bases, but rather salts containing the bases OH\u2212 and .\nLewis definition.\nThe hydrogen requirement of Arrhenius and Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry was removed by the Lewis definition of acid\u2013base reactions, devised by Gilbert N. Lewis in 1923, in the same year as Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry, but it was not elaborated by him until 1938. Instead of defining acid\u2013base reactions in terms of protons or other bonded substances, the Lewis definition defines a base (referred to as a \"Lewis base\") to be a compound that can donate an \"electron pair\", and an acid (a \"Lewis acid\") to be a compound that can receive this electron pair.\nFor example, boron trifluoride, BF3 is a typical Lewis acid. It can accept a pair of electrons as it has a vacancy in its octet. The fluoride ion has a full octet and can donate a pair of electrons. Thus\nis a typical Lewis acid, Lewis base reaction. All compounds of group 13 elements with a formula AX3 can behave as Lewis acids. Similarly, compounds of group 15 elements with a formula DY3, such as amines, NR3, and phosphines, PR3, can behave as Lewis bases. Adducts between them have the formula X3A\u2190DY3 with a dative covalent bond, shown symbolically as \u2190, between the atoms A (acceptor) and D (donor). Compounds of group 16 with a formula DX2 may also act as Lewis bases; in this way, a compound like an ether, R2O, or a thioether, R2S, can act as a Lewis base. The Lewis definition is not limited to these examples. For instance, carbon monoxide acts as a Lewis base when it forms an adduct with boron trifluoride, of formula F3B\u2190CO.\nAdducts involving metal ions are referred to as co-ordination compounds; each ligand donates a pair of electrons to the metal ion. The reaction\ncan be seen as an acid\u2013base reaction in which a stronger base (ammonia) replaces a weaker one (water)\nThe Lewis and Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry definitions are consistent with each other since the reaction\nis an acid\u2013base reaction in both theories.\nSolvent system definition.\nOne of the limitations of the Arrhenius definition is its reliance on water solutions. Edward Curtis Franklin studied the acid\u2013base reactions in liquid ammonia in 1905 and pointed out the similarities to the water-based Arrhenius theory. Albert F.O. Germann, working with liquid phosgene, , formulated the solvent-based theory in 1925, thereby generalizing the Arrhenius definition to cover aprotic solvents.\nGermann pointed out that in many solutions, there are ions in equilibrium with the neutral solvent molecules:\nFor example, water and ammonia undergo such dissociation into hydronium and hydroxide, and ammonium and amide, respectively:\nSome aprotic systems also undergo such dissociation, such as dinitrogen tetroxide into nitrosonium and nitrate, antimony trichloride into dichloroantimonium and tetrachloroantimonate, and phosgene into chlorocarboxonium and chloride:\nA solute that causes an increase in the concentration of the solvonium ions and a decrease in the concentration of solvate ions is defined as an \"acid\". A solute that causes an increase in the concentration of the solvate ions and a decrease in the concentration of the solvonium ions is defined as a \"base\".\nThus, in liquid ammonia, (supplying ) is a strong base, and (supplying ) is a strong acid. In liquid sulfur dioxide (), thionyl compounds (supplying ) behave as acids, and sulfites (supplying ) behave as bases.\nThe non-aqueous acid\u2013base reactions in liquid ammonia are similar to the reactions in water:\nNitric acid can be a base in liquid sulfuric acid:\nThe unique strength of this definition shows in describing the reactions in aprotic solvents; for example, in liquid :\nBecause the solvent system definition depends on the solute as well as on the solvent itself, a particular solute can be either an acid or a base depending on the choice of the solvent: is a strong acid in water, a weak acid in acetic acid, and a weak base in fluorosulfonic acid; this characteristic of the theory has been seen as both a strength and a weakness, because some substances (such as and ) have been seen to be acidic or basic on their own right. On the other hand, solvent system theory has been criticized as being too general to be useful. Also, it has been thought that there is something intrinsically acidic about hydrogen compounds, a property not shared by non-hydrogenic solvonium salts.\nLux\u2013Flood definition.\nThis acid\u2013base theory was a revival of oxygen theory of acids and bases, proposed by German chemist Hermann Lux in 1939, further improved by H\u00e5kon Flood circa 1947 and is still used in modern geochemistry and electrochemistry of molten salts. This definition describes an acid as an oxide ion () acceptor and a base as an oxide ion donor. For example:\nThis theory is also useful in the systematisation of the reactions of noble gas compounds, especially the xenon oxides, fluorides, and oxofluorides.\nUsanovich definition.\nMikhail Usanovich developed a general theory that does not restrict acidity to hydrogen-containing compounds, but his approach, published in 1938, was even more general than Lewis theory. Usanovich's theory can be summarized as defining an acid as anything that accepts negative species or donates positive ones, and a base as the reverse. This defined the concept of redox (oxidation-reduction) as a special case of acid\u2013base reactions\nSome examples of Usanovich acid\u2013base reactions include:\nRationalizing the strength of Lewis acid\u2013base interactions.\nHSAB theory.\nIn 1963, Ralph Pearson proposed a qualitative concept known as the Hard and Soft Acids and Bases principle. later made quantitative with help of Robert Parr in 1984. 'Hard' applies to species that are small, have high charge states, and are weakly polarizable. 'Soft' applies to species that are large, have low charge states and are strongly polarizable. Acids and bases interact, and the most stable interactions are hard\u2013hard and soft\u2013soft. This theory has found use in organic and inorganic chemistry.\nECW model.\nThe ECW model created by Russell S. Drago is a quantitative model that describes and predicts the strength of Lewis acid base interactions, \u2212\u0394\"H\". The model assigned \"E\" and \"C\" parameters to many Lewis acids and bases. Each acid is characterized by an \"E\"A and a \"C\"A. Each base is likewise characterized by its own \"E\"B and \"C\"B. The \"E\" and \"C\" parameters refer, respectively, to the electrostatic and covalent contributions to the strength of the bonds that the acid and base will form. The equation is\nThe \"W\" term represents a constant energy contribution for acid\u2013base reaction such as the cleavage of a dimeric acid or base. The equation predicts reversal of acids and base strengths. The graphical presentations of the equation show that there is no single order of Lewis base strengths or Lewis acid strengths.\nAcid\u2013base equilibrium.\nThe reaction of a strong acid with a strong base is essentially a quantitative reaction. For example,\nIn this reaction both the sodium and chloride ions are spectators as the neutralization reaction,\ndoes not involve them. With weak bases addition of acid is not quantitative because a solution of a weak base is a buffer solution. A solution of a weak acid is also a buffer solution. When a weak acid reacts with a weak base an equilibrium mixture is produced. For example, adenine, written as AH, can react with a hydrogen phosphate ion, .\nThe equilibrium constant for this reaction can be derived from the acid dissociation constants of adenine and of the dihydrogen phosphate ion.\nThe notation [X] signifies \"concentration of X\". When these two equations are combined by eliminating the hydrogen ion concentration, an expression for the equilibrium constant, \"K\" is obtained.\nAcid\u2013alkali reaction.\nAn acid\u2013alkali reaction is a special case of an acid\u2013base reaction, where the base used is also an alkali. When an acid reacts with an alkali salt (a metal hydroxide), the product is a metal salt and water. Acid\u2013alkali reactions are also neutralization reactions.\nIn general, acid\u2013alkali reactions can be simplified to\nby omitting spectator ions.\nAcids are in general pure substances that contain hydrogen cations () or cause them to be produced in solutions. Hydrochloric acid () and sulfuric acid () are common examples. In water, these break apart into ions:\nThe alkali breaks apart in water, yielding dissolved hydroxide ions:"}

He was of Arab-Quraysh origin and mainly based in Baghdad. He is best known as the author of \"Kitab al-Aghani\" (\"The Book of Songs\"), which includes information about the earliest attested periods of Arabic music (from the seventh to the ninth centuries) and the lives of poets and musicians from the pre-Islamic period to al-Isfahani's time. Given his contribution to the documentation of the history of Arabic music, al-Isfahani is characterised by Sawa as \"a true prophet of modern ethnomusicology\".\nDates.\nThe commonly accepted dates of al-Isfahani's birth and death are 284AH/897\u20138CE and 356/967, based on the dates given by al-Khatib al-Baghdadi which itself bases testimony of al-Isfahani's student, Muhammad ibn Abi al-Fawaris. However, the credibility of these dates is to be treated with discretion. No source places his death earlier than 356/967, but several place it later. These dates are at odds with a reference in the \"Kitab Adab al-ghuraba\" (\"The Book of the Etiquettes of Strangers\"), attributed to al-Isfahani, to his being in the prime of youth (\"fi ayyam al-shabiba wa-l-siba\") in 356/967. Calculation of the approximate dates of his birth and death through the lifespans of his students and his direct informants suggests that he was born before 290/902 and died after 348/960.\nBiography.\nAbu al-Faraj al-Isfahani was born in Isfahan, Persia (present-day Iran) but spent his youth and made his early studies in Baghdad (present-day Iraq). He was a direct descendant of the last of the Umayyad caliphs, Marwan II, and was thus connected with the Umayyad rulers in al-Andalus, and seems to have kept up a correspondence with them and to have sent them some of his works. He became famous for his knowledge of early Arabian antiquities.\nHis later life was spent in various parts of the Islamic world, in Aleppo with its Hamdanid governor Sayf ad-Dawlah (to whom he dedicated the \"Book of Songs\"), in Ray with the Buwayhid vizier Ibn 'Abbad, and elsewhere.\nFamily.\nThe epithet, al-Isfahani, refers to the city, Isfahan, on the Iranian plateau. Instead of indicating al-Isfahani's birthplace, this epithet seems to be common to al-Isfahani's family. Every reference al-Isfahani makes to his paternal relatives includes the attributive, al-Isfahani. According to Ibn Hazm (384\u2013456/994\u20131064), some descendants of the last Umayyad caliph, Marwan b. Muhammad (72\u2013132/691\u2013750), al-Isfahani's forefather, settled in Isfahan. However, it has to be borne in mind that the earliest information we have regarding al-Isfahani's family history only dates to the generation of his great-grandfather, Ahmad b. al-\u1e24aytham, who settled in Samarra sometime between 221/835\u20136 and 232/847.\nBased on al-Isfahani's references in the \"Kitab al-Aghani\" (hereafter, the \"Aghani\"), Ahmad b. al-Haytham seems to have led a privileged life in S\u0101marr\u0101\u02be, while his sons were well-connected with the elite of the Abbasid capital at that time. His son, Abd al-Aziz b. Ahmad, was \"one of the high ranking scribes in the days of al-Mutawakkil (r. 232\u2013247/847\u2013861) (\"min kib\u0101r al-kutt\u0101b f\u012b ayy\u0101m al-Mutawakkil\")\". Another son, Muhammad b. Ahmad (\"viz\". al-Isfahani's grandfather), was associated with the Abbasid officials, the vizier Ibn al-Zayy\u0101t (d. 233/847), the scribe Ibrahim b. al-Abbas al-\u1e62\u016bl\u012b (176\u2013243/792\u2013857), and the vizier Ubaydallah b. Sulayman (d. 288/901), besides the \u1e6c\u0101libid notables, above all, al-Husayn b. al-Husayn b. Zayd, who was the leader of the Banu Hashim of his time. The close ties with the Abbasid court continued in the generation of Muhammad's sons, al-Hasan and al-Husayn (al-Isfahani's father).\nIn various places in the \"Aghani\", al-Isfahani refers to Yahya b. Muhammad b. Thawaba (from the Al Thawaba) as his grandfather on his mother's side. It is often suggested that the family of Thawaba, being Shi'i, bequeathed their sectarian inclination to al-Isfahani. However, the identification of the Thawaba family as Shi'is only found in a late source, Yaqut's (574\u2013626/1178\u20131225) work. Although it is not implausible for the family of Thawaba to have been Shi'i-inclined in one way or another, since many elite families working under the Abbasid caliphate during this period of time indeed allied with Alids or their partisans, there is no evidence that members of the Thawaba family embraced an extreme form of Shi'ism.\nIn short, al-Isfahani came from a family well-entrenched in the networks of the Abbasid elite, which included the officials and the Alids. Despite the epithet, al-Isfahani, it does not seem that the Isfahani family has much to do with the city, Isfahan. Rather, the family was mainly based in S\u0101marr\u0101\u02be, from the generation of Ahmad b. al-\u1e24aytham, and then Baghdad. In the seats of the caliphate, a few members of this family worked as scribes, while maintaining friendship or alliance with other scribes, viziers, and notables. Like many of the court elite, al-Isfahani's family maintained an amicable relationship with the offspring of Ali and allied with families, such as the Thawaba family, sharing their veneration of Ali and Alids. However, it is hard to pinpoint such a reverential attitude towards Alids in terms of sectarian alignment, given the scanty information about al-Isfahani's family and the fluidity of sectarian identities at the time.\nEducation and career.\nThe Isfahani family's extensive social outreach is reflected in al-Isfahani's sources. Among the direct informants whom al-Isfahani cites in his works, one finds the members of his own family, who were further connected to other notable families, as mentioned above, the Al Thawaba, the Ban\u016b Munajjim, the Yaz\u012bd\u012bs, the \u1e62\u016bl\u012bs, the Ban\u016b \u1e24amd\u016bn, the \u1e6c\u0101hirids, the Ban\u016b al-Marzub\u0101n, and the \u1e6c\u0101libids.\nGiven that al-Isfahani and his family very likely settled in Baghdad around the beginning of the tenth century, it is no surprise that he transmitted from a considerable number of the inhabitants of or visitors to that city, such as, to name just a few: Ja\u1e25\u1e93a (d. 324/936), al-Khaff\u0101f, Ali b. Sulaym\u0101n al-Akhfash (d. 315/927 or 316/928), and Muhammad b. Jarir al-\u1e6cabari (d. 310/922). Like other scholars of his time, al-Isfahani travelled in pursuit of knowledge. Although the details are not sufficient for us to establish the dates of his journeys, based on the chains of transmission (\"as\u0101n\u012bd\", sing. \"isn\u0101d\") al-Isfahani cites consistently and meticulously in every report, it is certain that he transmitted from \u02bfAbd al-Malik b. Maslama and \u02bf\u0100\u1e63im b. Muhammad in Antakya; \u02bfAbdall\u0101h b. Muhammad b. Ishaq in Ahwaz; and Yahya b. A\u1e25mad b. al-Jawn in Raqqa. If we accept the ascription of the \"Kitab Adab al-ghuraba\" to al-Isfahani, then he once visited Ba\u1e63ra besides other towns such as \u1e24i\u1e63n Mahd\u012b, Matt\u016bth, and B\u0101jistr\u0101. Yet, none of these cities seems to have left as tremendous an impact upon al-Isfahani as K\u016bfa and Baghdad did. While al-Isfahani's Baghdadi informants were wide-ranging in their expertise as well as sectarian and theological tendencies, his K\u016bfan sources, to a certain degree, can be characterised as either Shi'i or keen on preserving and disseminating memory that favours Ali and his family. For example, Ibn \u02bfUqda (d. 333/944), mentioned in both the \"Agh\u0101n\u012b\" and the \"Maq\u0101til,\" is invariably cited for the reports about the Alids and their merits.\nThe journey in search for knowledge taken by al-Isfahani may not be particularly outstanding by the standard of his time, but the diversity of his sources' occupations and fortes is beyond doubt impressive. His informants can be assigned into one or more of the following categories: philologists and grammarians; singers and musicians; booksellers and copyists (\"sahhafun\" or \"warraqun\", sing. \"sahhaf\" or \"Warraq\"); boon companions; tutors (\"mu\u02beaddib\u016bn\", sing. \"mu\u02beaddib\"); scribes (\"kutt\u0101b\", sing. \"k\u0101tib\"); imams or preachers (\"khu\u1e6dab\u0101\u02be\", sing. \"kha\u1e6d\u012bb\"); religious scholars (of the \"\u1e25ad\u012bth\", the Qur\u02be\u0101nic recitations and exegeses, or jurisprudence) and judges; poets; and \"akhb\u0101r\u012bs\" (transmitters of reports of all sorts, including genealogical, historical, and anecdotal reports). The variety of the narrators and their narrations enriched al-I\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b's literary output, which covers a wide range of topics from amusing tales to the accounts of the Alids' martyrdom. His erudition is best illustrated by Abu Ali al-Muhassin al-Tanukhi's (329\u2013384/941\u2013994) comment:\nWith his encyclopaedic knowledge of music, musicians, poetry, poets, genealogy, history, and other subjects, al-I\u1e63fah\u0101n\u012b established himself as a learned scholar and teacher.\nHe was also a scribe and this is not surprising, given his families\u2019 scribal connections, but the details of his \"k\u0101tib\" activities are rather opaque. Although both al-Tan\u016bkh\u012b and al-Baghd\u0101d\u012b refer to al-Isfahani with the attribute, \"k\u0101tib\", they mention nothing of where he worked or for whom. The details of his job as a scribe only come later, with Yaqut, many of whose reports about al-Isfahani prove problematic. For instance, a report from Yaqut claims that al-Isfahani was the scribe of Rukn al-Dawla (d. 366/976) and mentions his resentment at Ab\u016b al-Fa\u1e0dl b. al-\u02bfAm\u012bd (d. 360/970). However, the very same report is mentioned by Ab\u016b \u1e24ayy\u0101n al-Taw\u1e25\u012bd\u012b (active fourth/tenth century) in his \"Akhl\u0101q al-waz\u012brayn\", where the aforementioned scribe of Rukn al-Dawla is identified as Ab\u016b al-Faraj \u1e24amd b. Muhammad, not Ab\u016b al-Faraj al-Isfahani. Thus, it is hard to know with certainty how and where al-Isfahani was engaged in his capacity as a \"k\u0101tib\". Nevertheless, al-Isfahani's association with the vizier, Ab\u016b Mu\u1e25ammad al-Muhallab\u012b (291\u2013352/903\u2013963), is well-documented. The friendship between the two began before al-Muhallab\u012b's vizierate in 339/950. The firm relationship between them is supported by al-Isfahani's poetry collected by al-Tha\u02bf\u0101lib\u012b (350\u2013429/961\u20131038): half of the fourteen poems are panegyrics dedicated to al-Muhallab\u012b. In addition, al-Isfahani's own work, \"al-Im\u0101\u02be al-shaw\u0101\u02bfir\" (\u201cEnslaved Women Who Composed Poetry\u201d), refers to the vizier \u2014 presumably, al-Muhallab\u012b \u2014 as his dedicatee. His no longer surviving \"Man\u0101j\u012bb al-khi\u1e63y\u0101n\" (\u201cThe Noble Eunuchs\u201d), which addresses two castrated male singers owned by al-Muhallab\u012b, was composed for him. His \"magnum opus\", the \"Agh\u0101n\u012b\", was very likely intended for him, as well. As a return for his literary efforts, according to al-Tan\u016bkh\u012b, al-Isfahani frequently received rewards from the vizier. Furthermore, for the sake of their long-term friendship and out of his respect for al-Isfahani's genius, al-Muhallab\u012b exceptionally tolerated al-Isfahani's uncouth manners and poor personal hygiene. The sources say nothing about al-Isfahani's fate, after al-Muhallab\u012b's death. In his last years, according to his student, Muhammad b. Ab\u012b al-Faw\u0101ris, he suffered from senility (\"khalla\u1e6da\").\nPersonality, preferences, and beliefs.\nAs a boon companion, al-Isfahani was unconventional in the sense that he does not seem to have been bothered to observe the social decorum of his time, as noted by a late biographical source: with his uncleanliness and gluttony, he presented a counterexample to elegance (\"\u1e93arf\"), as defined by one of his teachers, Abu al-\u1e6cayyib al-Washsh\u0101\u02be (d. 325/937). His unconformity to the social norms did not hinder him from being part of al-Muhallab\u012b's entourage or participation in the literary assemblies, but, inevitably, it resulted in frictions with other scholars and detraction from his enemies. Although al-Isfahani appeared eccentric to his human associates, he was a caring owner to his cat, named Yaqaq (white): he treated Yaqaq's colic (\"qulanj\") with an enema (\"al-\u1e25uqna\").\nIn contrast to his uncomely \"modus vivendi\", al-Isfahani's prose style is lucid, \u201cin clear and simple language, with unusual sincerity and frankness\u201d. Al-Isfahani's capacity as a litterateur is well illustrated by Abu Deeb, who depicts al-Isfahani as \"one of the finest writers of Arabic prose in his time, with a remarkable ability to relate widely different types of \"a\u1e35b\u0101r\" in a rich, lucid, rhythmic, and precise style, only occasionally exploiting such formal effects as \"sa\u01f0\u02bf\" (rhyming prose). He was also a fine poet with an opulent imagination. His poetry displays preoccupations similar to those of other urban poets of his time\". His pinpoint documentation of \"as\u0101n\u012bd\" and meticulous verification of information, provided in all his works, embody a truly scholarly character. Usually, in his treatment of a subject or an event, al-Isfahani lets his sources speak, but, occasionally, he voices his evaluation of poems and songs, as well as their creators. When dealing with conflicting reports, al-Isfahani either leaves his readers to decide or issues his judgment as to the most credible account. Yet, he frankly condemns sources whom he holds to be unreliable, for instance, Ibn Khurd\u0101dhbih on musicological information and Ibn al-Kalb\u012b on genealogy. Indeed, al-Isfahani assesses his source material with a critical eye, while striving to present a more balanced view on his biographeis, by focusing on their merits instead of elaborating on their flaws.\nThat said, al-Isfahani's personal preferences and sectarian partisanship are not absent from his works. In terms of music and songs, al-Isfahani is a fan of Ishaq b. Ibrahim al-Mawsili (155\u2013235/772\u2013850). In al-Isfahani's view, Ishaq b. Ibrahim was a multi-talented man, who excelled in a number of subjects, but, most importantly, music. Ishaq b. Ibrahim, as a collector of the reports about poets and singers, is an important source in his \"Agh\u0101n\u012b\". Besides being a mine of information, Ishaq b. Ibrahim's terminology for the description of the melodic modes is preferred over that of his opponent, Ibrahim ibn al-Mahdi (162\u2013224/778\u2013839), and adopted by al-Isfahani in his \"Aghani\". Furthermore, al-Isfahani embarked on the compilation of the \"Agh\u0101n\u012b\" because he was commissioned by his patron to reconstruct the list of the exquisite songs selected by Ishaq. In other words, the \"raison d\u2019etre\" of the \"Agh\u0101n\u012b\" is partly related to al-Isfahani's idol, Ishaq b. Ibrahim, and its information about singers, songs and performance owes a tremendous amount to him. Al-Isfahani's admiration for scholars or men of letters can be detected from time to time, usually in the passing comments in the chains of transmission. Yet al-Isfahani outspokenly expresses his admiration, in some cases, such as that of Ibn al-Mu\u02bftazz (247\u2013296/862\u2013909).\nAs an Umayyad by ancestry, al-Isfahani's later biographers mention his Shi'i affiliation with surprise. Yet, in the light of the history of the family's connections with the Abbasid elite of Shi'i inclination and the \u1e6c\u0101libids, and of his learning experience in K\u016bfa, his Shi'i conviction is understandable. Al-Tusi (385\u2013460/995\u20131067) is the only early source specifying the exact sect to which he pertains in the fluid Shi'i world: al-Isfahani is a Zayd\u012b. Although al-\u1e6c\u016bs\u012b's view is widely accepted, its veracity is not beyond doubt. Al-Isfahanidoes not seem to have been informed of the latest Zayd\u012b movements in Yemen and \u1e6cabarist\u0101n of his time, while his association with the K\u016bfan Zayd\u012b community, which to some degree became less distinguishable from the Sunn\u012bs, is yet to be studied in depth. It is clear, based on examination of how al-Isfahani redacts the reports at his disposal, that he does honour Ali, who plays a far more prominent role in his works than the first three caliphs, and some of his descendants, including Zaydi Shi'ism's eponym, Zayd ibn Ali (75\u2013122/694\u2013740), by presenting them positively, while, in some cases, leaving their enemies\u2019 rectitude in question. In spite of that, al-Isfahani is neither keen to identify the imams in the past, nor articulate as to the qualities of an imam. As a matter of fact, he hardly uses the word, not even applying it to Zayd b. Ali. Furthermore, he does not unconditionally approve any Alid revolt and seems somewhat lukewarm towards the group he refers to as Zaydis. Taken together, al-Isfahani's Shi'i conviction is better characterised as moderate love for Ali without impugning the dignity of the caliphs before him.\nLegacy.\nAl-Isfahani authored a number of works, but only a few survive. Three of them are preserved through the quotations: \"al-Qiyan\" (\"The Singing Girls Enslaved by Men\"), \"al-Diyarat\" (\"The Monasteries\"), and \"Mujarrad al-aghani\" (\u201cThe Abridgement of the Book of Songs\u201d). A fragment of the \"Mujarrad al-aghani\" can be found in Ibn Abi U\u1e63aybi'a's \u02bf\"Uyun al-anba' fi tabaqat al-atibba\"\u02be, which quotes a poem by the caliph, al-Ma\u02bem\u016bn (r. 198\u2013218/813\u2013833), which was arranged as a song by Mutayyam. The first two have been reconstructed and published by al-\u02bfAtiyya, who collects and collates the passages from later works that quote from al-Isfahani. The former, \"al-Qiy\u0101n\", is a collection of the biographies of the enslaved singing girls. In it, al-Isfahani provides the basic information about the biographical subjects, the men who enslaved them, and their interaction with poets, notables such as caliphs, and their admirers, with illustration of their poetic and/or musical talents. The latter, \"al-Diy\u0101r\u0101t\", provides information related to monasteries, with the indication of their geographical locations and, sometimes, history and topographical characteristics. However, it is questionable to what extent the reconstructed editions can represent the original texts, since the passages, which quote al-Isfahani as a source for the given subject and are thus included by the editor, seldom identify the titles of the works.\nFour works survive in manuscripts and have been edited and published: \"Maq\u0101til al-\u1e6c\u0101lib\u012by\u012bn\" (\"The \u1e6c\u0101libid Martyrs\"), \"Kitab al-Aghani\" (\"The Book of the Songs\"), \"Adab al-ghuraba\" (\"The Etiquettes of the Strangers\"), and \"al-Ima al-shawair\" (\"The Enslaved Women Who Composed Poetry\"). As noted above, al-Isfahani's authorship of the \"Adab al-ghuraba\u02be\" is disputed. The author, whoever he may have been, mentions in the preface his sufferings from the hardship of time and vicissitude of fate, and the solace which he seeks through the stories of bygone people. Hence, he collects in the \"Adab al-ghuraba\" the reports about the experiences of strangers \u2014 those away from their homes or their beloved ones. Some of the stories centre on the hardship which strangers, anonymous or not, encountered in their journey or exile, usually shown in the epigrams written on monuments, rocks, or walls. Others relate excursions to the monasteries for drinking.\nThe \"al-Im\u0101\u02be al-shaw\u0101\u02bfir\" was composed at the order of the vizier al-Muhallab\u012b, al-Isfahani's patron, who demanded collection of the reports about the enslaved women who composed poetry from the Umayyad to the Abbasid periods. Al-Isfahani confesses that he could not find any noteworthy poetess in the Umayyad period, because the people at that time were not impressed with the verses featuring tenderness and softness. Thus, he only records the Abbasid poetesses, with mention of the relevant fine verses or the pleasant tales, and arranges them in chronological order. There are 31 sections, addressing 32 poetesses, most of which are short and usually begin with al-Isfahani's summary of the subject.\nThe \"Maq\u0101til al-\u1e6c\u0101lib\u012by\u012bn\" is a historical-biographical compilation concerning the descendants of Abu Talib, who died under the following circumstances: being killed, poisoned to death in a treacherous way, on the run from the rulers\u2019 persecution, or confined until death. The \"Maq\u0101til\" literature was rather common, amongst Shi'is particularly, before al-Isfahani and he used many works of this genre as sources for the \"Maq\u0101til al-\u1e6c\u0101lib\u012by\u012bn\". Al-Isfahani does not explain the motivation behind this compilation nor mention any dedicatee, but, according to the preface of this work, he sets out as a condition to recount the reports about the \u1e6c\u0101libids who were \u201cpraiseworthy in their conduct and rightly guided in their belief (\"ma\u1e25m\u016bd al-\u1e6dar\u012bqa wa-sad\u012bd al-madhhab\")\u201d. Like the \"al-Im\u0101\u02be\", the work is structured in chronological order, beginning with the first \u1e6c\u0101lib\u012b martyr, Ja\u02bffar b. Ab\u012b \u1e6c\u0101lib, and ends in the year of its compilation \u2014 Jum\u0101d\u0101 I 313/August 925. For each biographical entry, al-Isfahani gives the full name, the lineage (sometimes adding the maternal side). Less often, he additionally gives the virtues and personal traits of the subject and other material he thinks noteworthy, for example the prophetic \"\u1e25ad\u012bth\" about, or transmitted by, the subject of the biography in question. Then, al-Isfahani gives the account of the death, which more often than not constitutes the end of the entry. Sometimes poetry for or by the subject is attached. The \"Maq\u0101til\" was adduced by many Shi'i and non-Shi'i compilers of the following centuries.\nThe \"Kitab al-Aghani\", al-Isfahanis best known work, is an immense compilation, including songs provided with musical indications (melodic modes and meters of songs), the biographies of poets and musicians of different periods in addition to historical material. As noted above, al-Isfahani embarks on compiling the \"Aghani\" first under the command of a patron, whom he calls \"ra'is\" (chief), to reconstruct the list of one hundred fine songs, selected by Ishaq b. Ibrahim. Due to an obscure report in Yaqut's \"Mu'jam\", this \"ra\u02be\u012bs\" is often assumed to be Sayf al-Dawla al-\u1e24amd\u0101n\u012b (r. 333\u2013356/945\u2013967), but recent studies suggest that a more plausible candidate for the dedicatee of the \"Aghani\" is the vizier al-Muhallab\u012b. The \"Aghani\" is divided into three parts: first, The Hundred Songs (\"al-mi'a al-\u1e63awt \u00a0al-mukhtara\") and other song collections; second, the songs of the caliphs and of their children and grandchildren (\"aghani al-khulafa wa-awladihim wa-awlad awladihim\"); third, al-Isfahanis selection of songs. The articles in each part are arranged based on different patterns, but it is mostly the song which introduces the articles on biographies or events. The \"Kitab al-Aghani\" is not the first book or collection of songs in Arabic, but one can assert that it is the most important one, for it \"is a unique mine of information not only on hundreds of song texts with their modes and meters, but also on the lives of their poets and composers, and on the social context of music making in early Islam and at the courts of the caliphs in Damascus and Baghdad\". Because of al-Isfahanis pedantic documentation of his sources, the \"Kitab al-Aghani\" can also be used to reconstruct earlier books of songs or biographical dictionaries on musicians that are otherwise lost.\nAs for the works that did not survive, based on their contents, as implied by their titles, they can be divided into the following categories:\nThe genealogical works: \"Nasab Bani Abd Shams\" (\"The Genealogy of the Banu Abd Shams\"), \"Jamharat al-nasab\" (\"The Compendium of Genealogies\"), \"Nasab Bani Shayban\" (\"The Genealogy of the Banu Shayban\"), and \"Nasab al-Mahaliba\" (\"The Genealogy of the Muhallabids\"), this last probably dedicated to his patron, the vizier al-Muhallabi.\nThe reports about specified or unspecified topics, such as \"Kitab al-Khammarin wa-l-khammarat\" (\"The Book of Tavern-Keepers, Male and Female\"), \"Akhbar al-tufayliyin\" (\"Reports about Party Crashers\"), \"al-Akhbar wa-l-nawadir\" (\"The Reports and Rare Tales\"), and \"Ayyam al-arab\" (\"The Battle-Days of the Arabs\"), which mentions 1700 days of the pre-Islamic tribal battles and was in circulation only in Andalusia.\nThe reports about music, musicians and singers: the aforementioned \"Manajib al-khisyan\" (\"The Noble Eunuchs\"), \"Akhbzr Jahza al-Barmaki\" (\"The Reports concerning Jahza al-Barmaki\"), \"al-Mamalik al-shu'ara\" (\"The Slave Poets\"), \"Adab al-samz\" (\"The Etiquettes of Listening to Music\"), and \"Risala fi 'ilal al-nagham\" (\"The Treatise on the Rules of Tones\").\nThere are two works, only mentioned by al-Tusi: \"Kitab ma nazala min al-Qur'an fi amir al-mu'min\u012bn wa-ahl baytih 'alayhim al-salam\" (\"The Book about the Qur'anic Verses Revealed regarding the Commander of the Faithful and the People of His Family, Peace upon Them\") and \"Kitab fihi kalam Fatima alayha al-salam fi Fadak\" (\"The Book concerning the Statements of F\u0101\u1e6dima, Peace upon Her, regarding Fadak\"). Should the attribution of these two works to al-Isfahani be correct, together with the \"Maqatil al-Talibiyin\", they reveal al-Isfahanis Shi'i partisanship.\nWorks.\nAl-Isfahani is best known as the author of \"Kitab al-Aghani\" (\"The Book of Songs\"), an encyclopedia of over 20 volumes and editions. However, he additionally wrote poetry, an anthology of verses on the monasteries of Mesopotamia and Egypt, and a genealogical work.\nThe first printed edition, published in 1868, contained 20 volumes. In 1888 Rudolf Ernst Br\u00fcnnow published a 21st volume being a collection of biographies not contained in the Bul\u0101q edition, edited from MSS in the Royal Library of Munich."}

The city grew along the valleys of the rivers Alcoa and Ba\u00e7a, from which it derives its name. The municipality population in 2011 was 56,693, in an area of . The city proper has a population of 15,800 inhabitants.\nThe city of Alcoba\u00e7a became notable after the first king of Portugal, Afonso Henriques, decided to build a church to commemorate the Conquest of Santar\u00e9m from the Moors in 1147. The church later evolved into the Monastery of Alcoba\u00e7a, one of the most magnificent gothic monuments in the country. In the church are the tombs of Pedro I of Portugal and his murdered mistress In\u00eas de Castro. Over the centuries this monastery played an important role in shaping Portuguese culture.\nA few kilometers to the north of Alcoba\u00e7a is the Monastery of Batalha, another gothic building constructed in memory of a different important battle, that of Aljubarrota. To the west of Alcoba\u00e7a is the fishing village of Nazar\u00e9, now a popular resort town. To the south is the city of Caldas da Rainha and the medieval town of \u00d3bidos. Also to the northeast is the town of Porto de M\u00f3s with its rebuilt castle.\nHistory.\nA town that only became notable in the 12th century when it was chosen as the future site of Portugal's largest church. In March 1147, the fledgling King Dom Afonso Henriques, defeated the Moors by capturing the city of Santar\u00e9m. As a tribute to his victory he vowed to build a magnificent home for the Order of Cistercians. It took another 76 years before this task was completed. The monarchy continued to carry out further construction and 60 years later King Dinis built the main cloister. The Monastery was consecrated in 1262.\nThe church contains the tombs of Pedro I of Portugal and his murdered mistress In\u00eas de Castro and with it the story of the tragic liaison between Pedro and In\u00eas. Forced at an early age as a royal duty, he was to marry Constanza, the \"Infanta\" (Princess) of Castile, but died shortly after the marriage. Dom Pedro escape with his true love and later lived in the city of Coimbra. His father, King Afonso IV, believing that the family of In\u00eas was a threat to his own kingdom had her murdered. Shortly after the death of his father Dom Pedro declared that he had married In\u00eas in a prior secret ceremony in Bragan\u00e7a, and promptly took a gruesome revenge on the killers and exhumed her body. He presented the embalmed corpse at the court with a crown on her head and demanded that all his courtiers kneel and individually pay homage to her decomposed hand. Today, their ornate tombs face each other so that on Judgment Day his first sight would be of his beloved In\u00eas.\nDuring the following centuries the monks from this monastery had a major influence on the development of Portuguese culture. Notably, in 1269 they were the first to give public lessons to their flock, and later they produced the first authoritative history on Portugal in a series of books. In 1810 the invading French pillaged the Abbey taking with them most of its most important treasures, including the noteworthy library. The items that remained were later stolen in 1834 during an anti-clerical riot and the banning of the religious Orders in Portugal.\nClimate.\nAlcoba\u00e7a has a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen:\"Csb\") with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters.\nParishes.\nAdministratively, the municipality is divided into 13 civil parishes (\"freguesias\"):\nCity information.\nThe main feature of the city is essentially the monastery that proudly presents a long and sombre fa\u00e7ade with 18th-century embellishments. This austerity is further emphasized in the cloisters with its apt name of \"Cloister of Silence\". In contrast within the Abbey is the massive kitchen with a running stream specially diverted to pass through as a supply of fresh water. The open area of the kitchen chimney is large enough to take a whole ox for roasting. The surround to the sacristy doorway is an outstanding example of Manueline decoration. In 1794, Lord Beckford visited the Abbey and commented that he found some 300 monks \"living in a very splendid manner\"!\nNearby locations.\nA few kilometers to the north of Alcoba\u00e7a is another wondrous building constructed in memory of a different important battle, that of Aljubarrota in 1385, when King John I of Portugal defeated the Castilians and ensuring two hundred years of independence from the Castilian invaders. The construction of the Abbey at Batalha commenced in 1388 and was added to by various Portuguese Kings over these next two centuries. To the east of Batalha is the world-famous location of F\u00e1tima and a point of pilgrimage for the Roman Catholic religion due to the vision of the Virgin Mary in 1917 by three young children whilst tending their flock. To the west of Alcoba\u00e7a is the well-known fishing village of Nazar\u00e9. Today, the village is now a small town and a popular holiday resort with most of its past and traditions having rapidly evaporated in the course of time. A very successful Portuguese feature film was made in the early 20th century that dramatically captured the primitive and dangerous life of these fishermen. Stoutly Catholic, the inhabitants have retained some of their past as can be still seen in their own particular style of costume. To the south is Caldas da Rainha and the quaint medieval town of \u00d3bidos that is an attraction for any tourists that enjoys a true glimpse of the past. Also to the south is the town of Porto de M\u00f3s with its fanciful rebuilt castle. This town borders the Nature Reserve Parque Natural das Serras de Aire e Candeeiros. These 390 square kilometres of limestone-covered landscape is also known for its caverns. The best known being the Grutas de Mira de Aire can be visited and consists of tunnels, caverns with stalactites, stalagmites, lakes, and a music and light finale.\nMajor events.\nNotable people from Alcoba\u00e7a include:\nInternational relations.\nAlcoba\u00e7a is twinned with:"}
{"id": "3044", "revid": "1016697424", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3044", "title": "Amphisbaena", "text": "The amphisbaena (, plural: amphisbaenae; ) is a mythological, ant-eating serpent with a head at each end. The creature is alternatively called the amphisbaina, amphisbene, amphisboena, amphisbona, amphista, amfivena, amphivena, or anphivena (the last two being feminine), and is also known as the \"Mother of Ants\". Its name comes from the Greek words \"amphis\", meaning \"both ways\", and \"bainein\", meaning \"to go\".\nMythology.\nAccording to Greek mythology, the amphisbaena was spawned from the blood that dripped from the Gorgon Medusa's head as Perseus flew over the Libyan Desert with her head in his hand, after which Cato's army then encountered it along with other serpents on the march. Amphisbaena fed on the corpses left behind. The amphisbaena has been referred to by various poets such as Nicander, John Milton, Alexander Pope, Percy Bysshe Shelley, Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, A. E. Housman and Allen Mandelbaum; as a mythological and legendary creature, it has been referenced by Lucan, Pliny the Elder, Isidore of Seville, and Thomas Browne, the last of whom debunked its existence.\nAppearance.\nThese early descriptions of the amphisbaena depicts a venomous, dual-headed snakelike creature. However, Medieval and later drawings often show it with two or more scaled feet, particularly chicken feet, and feathered wings. Some even depict it as a horned, dragon-like creature with a serpent-headed tail and small, round ears, while others have both \"necks\" of equal size so that it cannot be determined which is the rear head. Many descriptions of the amphisbaena say its eyes glow like candles or lightning, but the poet Nicander seems to contradict this by describing it as \"always dull of eye\". He also says: \"From either end protrudes a blunt chin; each is far from each other.\" Nicander's account seems to be referring to what is indeed called the Amphisbaenia, a group of real lizards.\nHabitat.\nThe amphisbaena is said to make its home in the desert.\nFolk medicine.\nIn ancient times, the supposedly dangerous amphisbaena had many uses in the art of folk medicine and other such remedies. Pliny notes that expecting women wearing a live amphisbaena around their necks would have safe pregnancies; however, if one's goal was to cure ailments such as arthritis or the common cold, one should wear only its skin. By eating the meat of the amphisbaena, one could supposedly attract many lovers of the opposite sex, and slaying one during the full moon could give power to one who is pure of heart and mind. Lumberjacks suffering from cold weather on the job could nail its carcass or skin to a tree to keep warm, while in the process allowing the tree to be felled more easily.\nOrigins.\nIn \"The Book of Beasts\", T.H. White suggests that the creature derives from sightings of the worm lizards of the same name. These creatures are found in the Mediterranean countries where many of these legends originated.\nIn media.\nIn John Milton's \"Paradise Lost\", after the Fall and the return of Satan to Hell, some of the fallen angelic host are transformed into the amphisbaena, to represent the animal by which the Fall was caused, i.e. a snake.\nThe amphisbaena is mentioned in the first book of Andrzej Sapkowski's \"The Witcher\" series, i.e. \"The Last Wish\", when \"The Witcher\"'s protagonist, Geralt of Rivia, is recalling past events when he meets an old acquaintance named Irion. The amphisbaena was endangering the region of Kovir until the beast was slain by Geralt's hand.\nBrandon Sanderson's novel \"Skyward\" has a character whose name is Arturo Mendez. His call sign is amphisbaena.\nIn the 1984 Scandinavian animated film \"Gallavants\", an amphisbaena (called in the film as a 'Vanterviper') appears as a minor antagonist. The two heads, a red one named Edil and a blue one called Fice, frequently disagree and argue, and sing a song about their miserable plight.\nAmphisbaena appears in some editions of the tabletop roleplaying game \"Dungeons &amp; Dragons\".\nThe Amphisbaena appears in the \"Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\" episode \"Battle Nexus: New York.\" This version is one of the known champions of the Battle Nexus. Big Mama had Michelangelo and Meat Sweats compete to feed each of its heads in order to satisfy. They managed to work together to pull it off.\nAmphisbaena has appeared in several video games as an enemy or boss monster, including \"La-Mulana\" and \".\" A creature called Amphisbaena appears in the games ' and ' but bears little resemblance to other renditions of the creature, appearing as an eyeless 4-legged reptile creature with the upper body of a human woman sprouting from its long tail instead of a double-headed serpent."}

As an inhalant, it also has a psychoactive effect, which has led to its recreational use with its smell being described as that of old socks or dirty feet. It is also referred to as \"banapple gas\".\nIt was first documented in 1844 and came into medical use in 1867.\nNomenclature.\nThe term \"amyl nitrite\" encompasses several isomers. In older literature, the common non-systematic name amyl was often used for the pentyl group, where the amyl group is a linear or normal (n) alkyl group, and the resulting amyl nitrite would have the structural formula CH3(CH2)4ONO, also referred to as n-amyl nitrite.\nA common form of amyl nitrite is the isomer with the formula (CH3)2CHCH2CH2ONO, which may be more specifically referred to as isoamyl nitrite.\nThe similarly named amyl nitrate has very different properties. At the same time, isopropyl nitrite has a similar structure and similar uses (also called 'poppers') but with worse side-effects.\nSynthesis and reactions.\nAlkyl nitrites are prepared by the reaction of alcohols with nitrous acid:\nThe reaction is called esterification. Synthesis of alkyl nitrites is, in general, straightforward and can be accomplished in home laboratories. A common procedure includes the dropwise addition of concentrated sulfuric acid to a cooled mixture of an aqueous sodium nitrite solution and an alcohol. The intermediately-formed stoichiometric mixture of nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide then converts the alcohol to the alkyl nitrite, which, due to its low density, will form an upper layer that can be easily decanted from the reaction mixture.\nIsoamyl nitrite decomposes in the presence of base to give nitrite salts and the isoamyl alcohol:\nAmyl nitrite, like other alkyl nitrites, reacts with carbanions to give oximes.\nAmyl nitrites are also useful as reagents in a modification of the Sandmeyer reaction. The reaction of the alkyl nitrite with an aromatic amine in a halogenated solvent produces a radical aromatic species, this then frees a halogen atom from the solvent. For the synthesis of aryl iodides diiodomethane is used, whereas bromoform is the solvent of choice for the synthesis of aryl bromides.\nPhysiological effects.\nAmyl nitrite, in common with other alkyl nitrites, is a potent vasodilator; it expands blood vessels, resulting in lowering of the blood pressure. Amyl nitrite may be used during cardiovascular stress testing in patients with suspected hypertrophic cardiomyopathy to cause vasodilation and thereby reduce afterload and provoke obstruction of blood flow towards the aorta from the ventricle by increasing the pressure gradient, thereby causing left ventricular outflow obstruction. Alkyl nitrites are a source of nitric oxide, which signals for relaxation of the involuntary muscles. Physical effects include decrease in blood pressure, headache, flushing of the face, increased heart rate, dizziness, and relaxation of involuntary muscles, especially the blood vessel walls and the internal and external anal sphincter. There are no withdrawal symptoms. Overdose symptoms include nausea, vomiting, hypotension, hypoventilation, shortness of breath, and fainting. The effects set in very quickly, typically within a few seconds and disappear within a few minutes. Amyl nitrite may also intensify the experience of synesthesia.\nToxicity.\nAlthough there are case reports of life-threatening toxicity involving unusually large amounts, typical inhaled doses of amyl nitrite is considered relatively safe. However, liquid amyl nitrite is highly toxic when ingested because of the unsafely high concentration it effects in blood. Regardless of the form or route of administration, acute toxicity principally results when the nitrite oxidizes a significant proportion of haemoglobin in the blood without oxygen, forming methemoglobin, which cannot carry oxygen. Severe poisoning cases will progress to methemoglobinemia, characterized by a blue-brown discoloration under the skin which could be mistaken for cyanosis. Treatment with oxygen and intravenous methylene blue frustrates visual confirmation further as methylene blue itself is, as its name suggests, a blue dye; the patient's changes in different shades of blue notwithstanding, it is an effective antidote by way of catalyzing the production of the enzyme responsible for reducing the methemoglobin in the blood back to haemoglobin.\nThe discoloration does mean that regular near-infrared based pulse oximetry becomes useless. More fundamentally, blood gas analysis on the whole has limited effectiveness, as increased methemoglobin levels increases the oxygen binding affinity of regular haemoglobin. Therefore, the measurement of actual ratios and levels of methemoglobin and hemoglobin must accompany any blood gas partial pressure sample in these cases."}

Outside the tropics, autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere), when the duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably. Day length decreases and night length increases as the season progresses until the Winter Solstice in December (Northern Hemisphere) and June (Southern Hemisphere). One of its main features in temperate climates is the shedding of leaves from deciduous trees.\nSome cultures regard the autumnal equinox as \"mid-autumn\", while others with a longer temperature lag treat the equinox as the start of autumn. In the English-speaking world, Autumn traditionally began with Lammas Day and ended around Hallowe'en, the approximate mid-points between Midsummer, the autumnal equinox, and Midwinter. Meteorologists (and Australia and most of the temperate countries in the southern hemisphere) use a definition based on Gregorian calendar months, with autumn being September, October, and November in the northern hemisphere, and March, April, and May in the southern hemisphere.\nIn North America, autumn traditionally starts with the September equinox (21 to 24 September) and ends with the winter solstice (21 or 22 December). Popular culture in the United States associates Labor Day, the first Monday in September, as the end of summer and the start of autumn; certain summer traditions, such as wearing white, are discouraged after that date. As daytime and nighttime temperatures decrease, trees change color and then shed their leaves. In traditional East Asian solar term, autumn starts on or around 8 August and ends on or about 7 November. In Ireland, the autumn months according to the national meteorological service, Met \u00c9ireann, are September, October and November. However, according to the Irish Calendar, which is based on ancient Gaelic traditions, autumn lasts throughout the months of August, September and October, or possibly a few days later, depending on tradition. In the Irish language, September is known as \"Me\u00e1n F\u00f3mhair\" (\"middle of autumn\") and October as \"Deireadh F\u00f3mhair\" (\"end of autumn\"). Persians celebrate the beginning of the autumn as Mehregan to honor Mithra (Mehr).\nEtymology.\nThe word \"autumn\" () is derived from Latin \"autumnus\", archaic \"auctumnus\", possibly from the ancient Etruscan root \"autu-\" and has within it connotations of the passing of the year. Alternative etymologies include Proto-Indo-European *\"h\u2083ew\u01f5\"- (\"cold\") or *\"h\u2082sows\"- (\"dry\").\nAfter the Greek era, the word continued to be used as the Old French word ' (' in modern French) or \"\" in Middle English, and was later normalised to the original Latin. In the Medieval period, there are rare examples of its use as early as the 12th century, but by the 16th century, it was in common use.\nBefore the 16th century, \"harvest\" was the term usually used to refer to the season, as it is common in other West Germanic languages to this day (cf. Dutch ', German ' and Scots \"\"). However, as more people gradually moved from working the land to living in towns, the word \"harvest\" lost its reference to the time of year and came to refer only to the actual activity of reaping, and \"autumn\", as well as \"fall\", began to replace it as a reference to the season.\nThe alternative word \"fall\" for the season traces its origins to old Germanic languages. The exact derivation is unclear, with the Old English ' or ' and the Old Norse \"\" all being possible candidates. However, these words all have the meaning \"to fall from a height\" and are clearly derived either from a common root or from each other. The term came to denote the season in 16th-century England, a contraction of Middle English expressions like \"fall of the leaf\" and \"fall of the year\". Compare the origin of \"spring\" from \"spring of the leaf\" and \"spring of the year\".\nDuring the 17th century, English emigration to the British colonies in North America was at its peak, and the new settlers took the English language with them. While the term \"fall\" gradually became nearly obsolete in Britain, it became the more common term in North America.\nThe name \"backend\", a once common name for the season in Northern England, has today been largely replaced by the name \"autumn\".\nAssociations.\nHarvest.\nAssociation with the transition from warm to cold weather, and its related status as the season of the primary harvest, has dominated its themes and popular images. In Western cultures, personifications of autumn are usually pretty, well-fed females adorned with fruits, vegetables and grains that ripen at this time. Many cultures feature autumnal harvest festivals, often the most important on their calendars. Still extant echoes of these celebrations are found in the autumn Thanksgiving holiday of the United States and Canada, and the Jewish Sukkot holiday with its roots as a full-moon harvest festival of \"tabernacles\" (living in outdoor huts around the time of harvest). There are also the many festivals celebrated by indigenous peoples of the Americas tied to the harvest of ripe foods gathered in the wild, the Chinese Mid-Autumn or Moon festival, and many others. The predominant mood of these autumnal celebrations is a gladness for the fruits of the earth mixed with a certain melancholy linked to the imminent arrival of harsh weather.\nThis view is presented in English poet John Keats' poem \"To Autumn\", where he describes the season as a time of bounteous fecundity, a time of 'mellow fruitfulness'.\nIn North America, while most foods are harvested during the autumn, foods particularly associated with the season include pumpkins (which are integral parts of both Thanksgiving and Halloween) and apples, which are used to make the seasonal beverage apple cider.\nMelancholia.\nAutumn, especially in poetry, has often been associated with melancholia. The possibilities and opportunities of summer are gone, and the chill of winter is on the horizon. Skies turn grey, the amount of usable daylight drops rapidly, and many people turn inward, both physically and mentally. It has been referred to as an unhealthy season.\nSimilar examples may be found in Irish poet William Butler Yeats' poem \"The Wild Swans at Coole\" where the maturing season that the poet observes symbolically represents his own ageing self. Like the natural world that he observes, he too has reached his prime and now must look forward to the inevitability of old age and death. French poet Paul Verlaine's \"Chanson d'automne\" (\"Autumn Song\") is likewise characterised by strong, painful feelings of sorrow. Keats' \"To Autumn\", written in September 1819, echoes this sense of melancholic reflection, but also emphasises the lush abundance of the season. The song \"Autumn Leaves\", based on the French song \"Les Feuilles mortes\", uses the melancholic atmosphere of the season and the end of summer as a metaphor for the mood of being separated from a loved one.\nHalloween.\nAutumn is associated with Halloween (influenced by Samhain, a Celtic autumn festival), and with it a widespread marketing campaign that promotes it. Halloween, 31 October, is in autumn in the northern hemisphere. The television, film, book, costume, home decoration, and confectionery industries use this time of year to promote products closely associated with such a holiday, with promotions going from late August or early September to 31 October, since their themes rapidly lose strength once the holiday ends, and advertising starts concentrating on Christmas.\nOther associations.\nIn some parts of the northern hemisphere, autumn has a strong association with the end of summer holiday and the start of a new school year, particularly for children in primary and secondary education. \"Back to School\" advertising and preparations usually occurs in the weeks leading to the beginning of autumn.\nEaster falls in autumn in the southern hemisphere.\nThanksgiving Day is a national holiday celebrated in Canada, in the United States, in some of the Caribbean islands and in Liberia. Thanksgiving is celebrated on the second Monday of October in Canada and on the fourth Thursday of November in the United States, and around the same part of the year in other places. Similarly named festival holidays occur in Germany and Japan.\nTelevision stations and networks, particularly in North America, traditionally begin their regular seasons in their autumn, with new series and new episodes of existing series debuting mostly during late September or early October (series that debut outside the fall season are usually known as mid-season replacements). A sweeps period takes place in November to measure Nielsen Ratings.\nAmerican football is played almost exclusively in the autumn months; at the high school level, seasons run from late August through early November, with some playoff games and holiday rivalry contests being played as late as Thanksgiving. In many American states, the championship games take place in early December. College football's regular season runs from September through November, while the main professional circuit, the National Football League, plays from September through to early January. Summer sports, such as Major League Soccer, Canadian football, stock car racing, tennis, golf, cricket, and professional baseball, wrap up their seasons in early to late autumn; Major League Baseball's championship World Series is known popularly as the \"Fall Classic\". (Amateur baseball is usually finished by August.) Likewise, professional winter sports, such as ice hockey, basketball, and most leagues of association football in Europe, are in the early stages of their seasons during autumn; American college basketball and college ice hockey play teams outside their athletic conferences during the late autumn before their in-conference schedules begin in winter.\nThe Christian religious holidays of All Saints' Day and All Souls' Day are observed in autumn in the Northern hemisphere.\nSince 1997, Autumn has been one of the top 100 names for girls in the United States.\nIn Indian mythology, autumn is considered to be the preferred season for the goddess of learning Saraswati, who is also known by the name of \"goddess of autumn\" (Sharada).\nIn Asian mysticism, Autumn is associated with the element of metal, and subsequently with the colour white, the White Tiger of the West, and death and mourning.\nTourism.\nAlthough colour change in leaves occurs wherever deciduous trees are found, coloured autumn foliage is noted in various regions of the world: most of North America, Eastern Asia (including China, Korea, and Japan), Europe, southeast, south and part of the midwest of Brazil, the forest of Patagonia, eastern Australia and New Zealand's South Island.\nEastern Canada and New England are famous for their autumnal foliage, and this attracts major tourism (worth billions of US dollars) for the regions."}

{"id": "3052", "revid": "57939", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3052", "title": "Alameda, California", "text": "Alameda ( ; ) is a city in Alameda County, California, United States. It spans Alameda Island and Bay Farm Island. It is adjacent to and south of Oakland and east of San Francisco across the San Francisco Bay. Bay Farm Island, a portion of which is also known as \"Harbor Bay Isle\", is part of the mainland adjacent to Oakland International Airport. The city's estimated 2019 population was 77,624. Alameda is a charter city, rather than a general law city and adopted a council\u2013manager government in 1916.\nHistory.\nEarly history and settlement.\nAlameda occupies what was originally a peninsula connected to Oakland. Much of it was low-lying and marshy. The higher ground nearby and adjacent parts of what is now downtown Oakland were the site of one of the largest coastal oak forests in the world. Spanish colonists called the area \"Encinal\", meaning \"forest of evergreen oak\". \"Alameda\" is Spanish for \"grove of poplar trees\" or \"tree-lined avenue.\" It was chosen as the name of the city in 1853 by popular vote.\nThe inhabitants at the time of the arrival of the Spanish in the late 18th century were a local band of the Ohlone tribe. The peninsula was included in the vast Rancho San Antonio granted in 1820 to Luis Peralta by the Spanish king who claimed California. The grant was later confirmed by the Republic of Mexico upon its independence in 1821 from Spain.\nOver time, the place became known as Bolsa de Encinal or Encinal de San Antonio.\nCity development.\nThe city was founded on June 6, 1853, after the United States acquired California following the Mexican-American War of 1848. The town originally contained three small settlements. \"Alameda\" referred to the village at Encinal and High streets, Hibbardsville was located at the North Shore ferry and shipping terminal, and Woodstock was on the west near the ferry piers of the South Pacific Coast Railroad and the Central Pacific. Eventually, the Central Pacific's ferry pier became the Alameda Mole, featuring transit connections among the San Francisco ferries, local trollies, and Southern Pacific (formerly Central Pacific) commuter lines.\nThe first post office opened in 1854. The first school, Schermerhorn School, was opened in 1855 (and eventually was renamed as Lincoln School); Encinal School was opened in 1860 (and closed in 1980). The San Francisco and Alameda Railroad opened the Encinal station in 1864. The Encinal area was also known as Fasskings Station in honor of Frederick Louis Fassking. Encinal's own post office opened in 1876, was renamed West End in 1877, and closed in 1891. The West End area was originally called Bowman's Point in honor of Charles G. Bowman, an early United States settler.\nOn September 6, 1869, the Alameda Terminal made history; it was the site of the arrival of the first train via the First Transcontinental Railroad to reach the shores of San Francisco Bay, thus achieving the first coast to coast transcontinental railroad in North America. The transcontinental terminus was switched to the Oakland Pier two months later, on November 8, 1869.\nThe borders of Alameda were made coextensive with the island in 1872, incorporating Woodstock into Alameda. In his autobiography, writer Mark Twain described Alameda as \"The Garden of California.\"\nNeptune Beach.\nIn 1917, a private entertainment park called Neptune Beach was built in the area now known as Crab Cove. Often compared to Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, the park was a major recreation destination in the 1920s and 1930s. The original owners, the Strehlow family, partnered with a local confectioner to create treats unique to Neptune Beach. Both the American snow cone and the popsicle were first sold at Neptune Beach. The Kewpie doll, hand-painted and dressed in unique hand-sewn dresses, became the original prize for winning games of chance at the beach\u00a0\u2013 another Neptune Beach innovation. The Strehlows owned and operated the beach on their own. They filled in a section of the bay to add an additional Olympic-size swimming pool and a roller coaster, which must have given riders a tremendous view of the bay. The \"Cottage Baths\" were available for rent.\nNeptune Beach's two large outdoor pools hosted swimming races and exhibitions by such notable swimmers such as Olympian Johnny Weissmuller and Jack LaLanne. Weissmuller later starred in films as the original Tarzan character. LaLanne started a longlasting chain of health clubs and appeared on television. The park closed down in 1939 because the Great Depression left many people without much money, the completion of the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge changed traffic patterns, people avoided paying the admission price, and the rise of car culture gave people many more choices for recreation destinations.\nOnce the Bay Bridge was complete, the rail lines, which ran past the entrance to Neptune Beach on the way to the Alameda Mole and the Ferry, lost passengers in great number as people shifted to automobiles. People began using their cars to escape the city and the close suburbs like Alameda and traveled further afield in California. More distant locations appealed to cash-rich San Francisco tourists in the postwar years. Youngsters in town became aware of ways to avoid paying the dime for admission to the park. Strong swimmers or waders could sneak in on the bayside just by swimming around the fence.\nSome resort homes and buildings from the Neptune Beach era still exist in present-day Alameda. The Croll Building, on the corner of Webster Street and Central Avenue, was the site of Croll's Gardens and Hotel, used as training quarters for some of the greatest fighters in boxing history from 1883 to 1914. James J. Corbett, Bob Fitzsimmons, Jim Jeffries, Jack Johnson, and several other champions all stayed and trained here. Today, this preserved building has been adapted for retail and restaurants. Neptune Court, a block away on the corner of Central and McKay avenues, is also a surviving building from the resort era.\nThe vast majority of the Neptune Beach structures\u00a0\u2013 the hand-carved carousel from the world-famed Dentzel Company, the Ferris wheel, the roller coaster, and other rides\u00a0\u2013 were auctioned off in 1940, yielding pennies on the dollar of their original cost. the city did not construct any swimming facilities or develop a local beach to replace that of Neptune Beach.\nTransportation.\nWhen the railroad came to town in 1860s, Park Street developed as the major thoroughfare of the city. After the main Alameda train station was located here, residents of Old Alameda pulled up stakes and moved across town to the new downtown. The street's location was chosen by two landowners who wished to attract tenants and development to their land. They designated their mutual property line as Park Street.\nThe need for expanded shipping facilities and increased flow of current through the estuary led to the dredging of a tidal canal through the marshland between Oakland and Alameda. Construction started in 1874, but it was not completed until 1902, resulting in Alameda becoming an island.\nMost of the soil from the canal dredging was used to fill in the nearby marshland. The area of Alameda called Bay Farm Island is no longer an island but is attached by fill to Oakland. In his youth, author Jack London was known to take part in oyster pirating in the highly productive oyster beds near Bay Farm Island, today long gone.\nThe Alameda Works Shipyard was one of the largest and best-equipped shipyards in the country. Together with other industrial facilities, it became part of the defense industry buildup before and during World War II, which attracted many African-American and European-American migrants from other parts of the United States for the high-paying jobs. In the 1950s, Alameda's industrial and shipbuilding industries thrived along the Alameda Estuary. This was the site of operation of the world's first-ever, land-based, containerized shipping crane.\nIn the early 21st century, the Port of Oakland, across the estuary, has become one of the largest ports on the West Coast. Its operators use shipping technologies originally experimented within Alameda. As of March 21, 2006, Alameda is a \"Coast Guard City\", one of seven then designated in the country. As of 2018, it is one of twenty-one within the country.\nIn addition to the regular trains running to the Alameda Mole, Alameda was also served by local steam commuter lines of the Southern Pacific (initially, the Central Pacific). Alameda was the site of the Southern Pacific's West Alameda Shops, where all the electric trains were maintained and repaired. These were later adapted as the East Bay Electric Lines. Southern Pacific's electrified trains were not streetcars, but full-sized railroad cars that connected to the mainland via bridges at Webster Street and Fruitvale (only the latter bridge survives today). The trains ran to both the Oakland Mole and the Alameda Mole. A line that ran between the two moles was dubbed the \"Horseshoe Line\" for the shape of the route on a map. Soon after completion of the Bay Bridge, Alameda trains connected directly to San Francisco by the lower deck of the bridge. The ferries became unnecessary.\nIn the 1930s Pan American Airways established a seaplane port along with the fill that led to the Alameda Mole. This was the original home base for the China Clipper flying boat.\nIn 1929, the University of California established the San Francisco Airdrome located near the current Webster Street tube as a public airport. The Bay Airdrome had its gala christening party in 1930. The airfield was a busy place, as an early home base for Coastal Air Freight, Varney Air Lines, West Coast Air Transport, Western Air Express, the Transbay Air Ferries, and Boeing's Pacific Air Transport. The Airdrome was closed in 1941 when its air traffic interfered with the newly built Naval Air Station Alameda (NAS Alameda). With the advent of World War II, a vast stretch of the marshy area southwest of the Alameda Mole was filled and the NAS Alameda established. This major Naval facility included a large airfield, as well as docks for several aircraft carriers. It closed in 1997.\nStarting in the 1940s and continuing into the 1970s, multiple proposals were considered to build a highway bridge from Alameda to the San Francisco Peninsula, known as the Southern Crossing.\nThe Bay Area Rapid Transit is currently studying the creation of a second Transbay Tube; some potential alignments would bring BART service to Alameda Island.\n1950\u2013present.\nIn the late 1950s, the Utah Construction Company began a landfill beyond the \"Old Sea Wall\" and created \"South Shore\".\nOn February 7, 1973, a USN Vought A-7E Corsair II fighter jet on a routine training mission from Lemoore Naval Air Station suddenly caught fire, over the San Francisco Bay and crashed into the Tahoe Apartments in Alameda. Eleven people, including pilot Lieutenant Robert Lee Ward, died in the crash and fire.\nGeography.\nAlameda's nickname is \"The Island City\" (or simply \"the island\"). The current city occupies two islands as well as a small section of the mainland. Today, the city consists of the main original section, with the former Naval Air Station Alameda (NAS Alameda) at the west end of Alameda Island, Southshore along the southern side of Alameda Island, and Bay Farm Island, which is part of the mainland proper. The area of the former NAS is now known as \"Alameda Point.\" The Southshore area is separated from the main part of Alameda Island by a lagoon; the north shore of the lagoon is located approximately where the original south shore of the island was. Alameda Point and Southshore are built on bay fill.\nNot all of Alameda Island is part of the City of Alameda, a small portion of a dump site west of the former runway at Alameda Naval Air Station extends far enough into San Francisco Bay that it is over the county line and part of the City and County of San Francisco. \nCoast Guard Island, a small island between Alameda Island and Oakland, is also part of Alameda and is the home of Integrated Support Command Alameda\nClimate.\nThis region experiences warm (but not hot), dry summers, and cool (but not cold), wet winters. According to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification system, Alameda has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated \"Csb\" on climate maps. Annual precipitation is about , all rain (snow is extremely rare at sea level in the San Francisco Bay area).\nDemographics.\n2010.\nThe 2010 United States Census reported that Alameda had a population of 73,812. (2015 census estimates place the population at 78,630)\nThe population density was 3,214.9 people per square mile (1,241.3/km).

Alameda also has a historic Japanese American community and had a small Japanese business district on a portion of Park Street before World War II, when the city's Japanese population was interned. A Japanese Buddhist church is one of the few remaining buildings left of Alameda's pre-war Japanese American community.\nPolitics.\nAccording to the California Secretary of State, as of February 10, 2019, Alameda has 48,609 registered voters. Of those, 27,323 (56.2%) are registered Democrats, 5,240 (10.8%) are registered Republicans, and 13,950 (28.7%) have declined to state a political party.\nTransportation.\nVehicle access to Alameda Island is via three bridges from Oakland (Park Street, Fruitvale Avenue, and High Street Bridges), as well as the two one-way Posey and Webster Street Tubes leading into Oakland's Chinatown. Connections from Alameda to Bay Farm Island are provided via the Bay Farm Island Bridge for vehicular traffic as well as the Bay Farm Island Bicycle Bridge (the only pedestrian/bicycle-only drawbridge in the United States). California State Route 61 runs down city streets from the Posey and Webster Street Tubes, across the Bay Farm Island Bridge, and south to the Oakland Airport. The island is just minutes off Interstate 880 in Oakland. The speed limit for the city is 25\u00a0mph (40\u00a0km/h) on almost every road.\nPublic transportation options include:\nAttractions.\nVictorian houses comprise 9% of all single-family houses (1,500) in Alameda and many more have been divided into two- to four-unit dwellings.\nDue to its proximity to the Bay, wind surfers and kite surfers can often be seen at Robert W. Crown Memorial State Beach. From the beach, there are also views of the San Francisco skyline and the San Francisco\u2013Oakland Bay Bridge.\nThe aircraft carrier , a museum ship, has been moored at the former Naval Air Station as the USS \"Hornet\" Museum since 1998. This ship was originally named the USS \"Kearsarge\", but was renamed in honor of the previous \"Hornet\" (CV-8) (famous for the Doolittle raid), which was lost in October 1942.\nAlameda was twice home to the official offices and training facility of the National Football League Oakland Raiders. First from 1966 until 1983 when the team moved to Los Angeles and the offices and training facility moved to El Segundo, California, and again from 1996 until 2020 when the team moved to Las Vegas and the offices and training facility moved to Henderson, Nevada.\nAt the turn of the 19th century, the city of Alameda took a large chunk of Charles Froling's land away to build a street. Froling had planned to build his dream house on the plot of land he received through inheritance. To spite the city and an unsympathetic neighbor, Froling built a house wide, long and high on the tiny strip of land left to him. The Froling spite house is still standing and occupied.\nThe Fourth of July parade is advertised as the second oldest and second-longest Fourth of July parade in the United States. It features homemade floats, classic cars, motorized living room furniture, fire-breathing dragons, and marching bands.\nThe Historic Park Street Business District has many buildings that date back to the 1800s and is a designated Historic Commercial District on the National Register. This main thoroughfare of downtown Alameda Is filled with local shops, restaurants, drinking establishments, and services. The renovated 1932 Alameda Theatre &amp; Cineplex is the cultural centerpiece of the commercial district.\nEconomy.\nTop employers.\nAccording to the city's 2016 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report, the top employers in the city are:\nAlameda Point.\nNaval Air Station Alameda (NAS) which was decommissioned in 1997, has been turned over to the City of Alameda for civilian development.\nAmerica's Cup.\nThe 33rd America's Cup Race was won by Golden Gate Yacht Club racing team BMW Oracle, founded by Larry Ellison. Possible use of the air station that was considered was to partner with San Francisco for 34th America's Cup.\nWithin 2 weeks of the Golden Gate Yacht Club winning the America's Cup, Alameda city council with local support sent a unanimous letter of support to hold AC 34 in San Francisco Bay Area. In early 2011, the City Council created an ad hoc America's Cup Citizens Advisory Committee to look for ways that Alameda could draw interest from teams and potential spectators. Through these efforts, the Swedish Artemis Racing team created their team based in one of the former air station hangars on Alameda Point, with a dock at Seaplane Lagoon.\nBeer, wine and spirits production.\nA cluster of artisan distilleries, wineries, breweries and tasting rooms along Monarch Street at Alameda Point is now referred to by the City of Alameda as \"Spirits Alley\". These business include Rock Wall Winery, Building 43 Winery, Hangar 1, St. George Spirits and Faction Brewing. In 2017, Admiral Maltings opened at Alameda Point. Designed to supply craft brewers and whisky producers, it is the first craft malting house in California.\nThe modern era of winemaking in Alameda begins in 1978 when Alameda veterinarian Kent Rosenblum and his wife Kathy founded Rosenblum Cellars. In 2008, the company was purchased by Diageo Estates for $105 million. In 2014, the Rosenblum tasting room at Alameda Point closed and moved to Jack London Square in Oakland. Shauna Rosenblum, daughter of Kent and Kathy, is the winemaker for Rock Wall Winery. In December 2007, St. George Absinthe Verte, produced by St. George Spirits became the first brand of American-made absinthe to be legally produced in the United States since a ban was enacted in 1912.\nAlameda Island Brewing is located on Park Street.\nMedia.\nAlameda's first newspaper, the \"Encinal\", appeared in the early 1850s and the paper's editor was instrumental in the movement to incorporate the city. Following the \"Encinal\", several other papers appeared along geographic lines, and the \"Daily Argus\" eventually rose to prominence. A young Alameda native, Joseph R. Knowland, wrote political and historical articles for the Alameda papers. Later, Knowland owned the powerful \"Oakland Tribune\". Around 1900, the \"Daily Argus\" began to fade in importance and east and west papers \"The Times\" and \"The Star\" combined to take the leading role as the \"Alameda Times-Star\" in the 1930s. The \"Times-Star\" was sold to the Alameda Newspaper Group in the 1970s.\nIn 1997, the Hills Newspaper chain was bought by Knight Ridder, at the time, the second-largest newspaper chain in the U.S. Following the buyout, former Hills Newspapers employees recognized the lack of a local community voice in Alameda, and again formed a new locally based newspaper, the \"Alameda Sun\", in 2001. In 2006, Knight Ridder announced its impending sale to McClatchy Corp., a Sacramento-based publishing firm. McClatchy Corp. has put the \"Contra Costa Times\", which under the Knight-Ridder reorganization included all five of the original Hills Newspapers, up for sale. The current owners of the \"Alameda Times-Star\", Digital First Media, based in Colorado, have announced a strong interest in buying both the \"Contra Costa Times\" chain and the \"San Jose Mercury News\", consolidating the daily newspaper market of the East Bay, effectively under one owner. MediaNews closed the \"Times-Star\" in 2011.\nThe Alameda community is currently served by two weekly newspapers, the Alameda Journal, owned by the Digital First Media, and the Alameda Sun.\nServices.\nAlameda Free Library.\nAfter two previous failures, voters in the city passed a ballot measure in 2000 authorizing a bond measure for construction of a new main library to replace the city's Carnegie Library, damaged during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. The city also received state funds for the new main library and opened the doors to the new facility in November 2006.\nThere are three library locations: the Main Library in downtown Alameda and two library branches; the Bay Farm Island Library serving the Bay Farm and Harbor Bay communities and the West End Library serving the West End of Alameda.\nAlameda Hospital.\nFounded in 1894, Alameda Hospital is located at Clinton Avenue and Willow Street.\nAlameda Municipal Power.\nUnlike surrounding communities, Alameda has a municipal power service, Alameda Municipal Power (AMP), that delivers services directly to consumers. AMP sold the majority of its telecommunications business to Comcast in 2008 but continues to provide telecommunication service at Alameda Point.\nDuring the California electricity crisis of 2000 and 2001, Alameda Municipal Power did not raise electricity rates, while residents in most of the state endured significant price increases.\nArts and culture.\nThe Alameda Arts Council (AAC) serves as the local Alameda City arts council. The Alameda Civic Ballet is the ballet troupe of the city. The Alameda Museum features displays on the history of Alameda. The Alameda Art Association has about 80 members as of January 2011, and has a gallery space at South Shore Center mall. The Association began in 1944. An annual benefit, Circus for Arts in the Schools, was started by clown artist Jeff Raz in 2004. Photo-realist Robert Bechtle has painted numerous Alameda subjects, including \"Alameda Gran Torino\", which was acquired by SFMOMA in 1974 and remains one of Bechtle's most famous works.\nFilms shot in Alameda.\nAlameda has been home to many movie sets. Some of the movies filmed on the island have included \"Bicentennial Man\", \"The Net\", \"The Matrix Reloaded\", \"The Matrix Revolutions\", \"Bee Season\", the original 1968 \"Your, Mine and Ours\" and the movie musical \"Rent\". Parts of Alameda High School were animated for the \"Animatrix\" episode \"Kid's Story\". A massive hangar at the former Naval Air Station Alameda was used to film special scenes requiring computer-generated imagery for movies such as \"Bicentennial Man\", \"Flubber\", \"What Dreams May Come\", ' and many scenes from the \"Matrix\" trilogy, including the signature bullet time scene. The open space of the decommissioned naval base often hosts \"MythBusters more dangerous experiments. The movie \"Spirit Of '76\" was filmed all throughout Alameda.\nThe documentary, \"Shallow Waters: The Public Death of Raymond Zack\" was filmed at Alameda locations, and chronicled the 2011 Death of Raymond Zack on Crown Beach in Alameda. The film was screened in 2016 at the Michaan Auction House Theater in Alameda.\nThe USS \"Hornet\" Museum, permanently moored at Alameda Point, has been the site for scenes used in major theatrical releases: Pearl Harbor (2001), \"\", \"Rescue Dawn\", and \"The Master\". In addition, the aircraft carrier has been used for television shows such as \"JAG\", \"Carrier\", \"Looking\", \"The Great Escape\", and the special military episode of \"Fear Factor\"; plus a number of television commercials.\nTheaters.\nThe city restored the historic Art Deco city landmark Alameda Theatre, expanding it to include a theater multiplex. The public opening was May 21, 2008.\nThe Altarena Playhouse, which performs comedies, dramas, and musicals, was founded in 1938 and is the longest continuously operating community theater in the San Francisco Bay Area.\nRhythmix Cultural Works.\nRhythmix Cultural Works (RCW) brings people of all ages together to experience and explore music, dance, visual art, and educational opportunities. RCW's programs are housed in a restored industrial waterfront building that speaks to Alameda's history while creating an inclusive venue that reflects the Bay Area's rich diversity. The organization offers an array of arts programming to the community including Island Arts, Island City Waterways, Round the World Festival and its Performance Art and Learning program (PAL) that serves more than 2000 youth with free cultural arts assemblies each year.\nFestivals on Webster Street.\nWebster Street in Alameda has long been the host of many arts, crafts and holiday festivals. During some of these festivals, the Chamber of Commerce along with the West Alameda Business Association (WABA) will block off a portion of Webster St. for the entertainment of festival-goers. Festivals such as The Island JAM formerly known as the Peanut Butter Jam Festival bring a lot of local and outside visitors. Other events on the \"West End\" include Trick-or-Treat on Webster Street where merchants supply goodies for local children and culminate with a parade and costume contest; in December \"Santa Claus Meet-n-Greet on Webster Street\" happens with elves, and a photo with Santa Claus.\nFestivals on Park Street.\nThere are three major events when the street in Alameda's historic downtown district is closed to vehicular traffic. The \"Park Street Spring Festival\" takes place every May during the weekend of Mother's Day and attracts over 50,000 visitors. The \"Park Street Art &amp; Wine Faire\" takes place the last weekend of every July and attracts over 100,000 visitors. Both street fairs feature over 150 arts &amp; crafts vendors, food vendors, beer and wine pouring, a children's area, and two stages with regional entertainment. The \"Park Street Classic Car Show\" is held on the second Saturday every October and displays over 400 vintage vehicles.\nSand Castle and Sculpture Contest.\nThe annual Sand Castle and Sculpture Contest takes place in June at the Robert Crown Memorial State Beach. The first contest was held in 1967. Participants compete in three different categories: Ages 12 and Under, Ages 13 and Over and Family.\nEducation.\nPublic primary and secondary education in Alameda is the responsibility of the Alameda Unified School District, which is legally separate from the City of Alameda government (as is common throughout California). The College of Alameda, a two-year community college in the West End is part of the Peralta Community College District. The city has numerous private primary schools, and one private high school, St. Joseph Notre Dame High School, a Catholic school.\nSister cities.\nAlameda's relationships with Wuxi and Jiangyin were initiated in 2005, in part, by Stewart Chen, who then served on the City of Alameda Social Service and Human Relations board, and who went on to be elected to Alameda City Council in November, 2012.\nWuxi, China, is a so-called friendship city, because the diplomacy organization Sister Cities International does not recognize the relationship.\nControversy.\nIn September 2013, a Tibetan rights group initiated a social media and e-mail campaign targeting the Mayor of Alameda, complaining that City of Alameda's participation in, and association with, a flag-raising ceremony to recognize National Day of the People's Republic of China on October 1 was tantamount to endorsing the communist regime in China, its human rights abuses, and the occupation of Tibet. The City of Alameda responded that the ceremony was a function of the Alameda Sister City Association and the Alameda Wuxi Friendship Committee, not a function of the City of Alameda. The Tibetan rights group responded that on September 26, the City of Alameda Social Service and Human Relations board appointed a member, Michael Robles-Wong, as a representative to the Sister City Association.\nOn October 1, 2013, the Tibetan rights groupsTibetTruth and Bay Area Friends of Tibet sent roughly 75 protesters to Alameda City Hall to protest the ceremony, which organizers ultimately canceled before it began. Former City of Alameda Councilmember Frank Matarrese announced the cancellation. Then-city councilmember Stewart Chen subsequently defended the ceremony, as a diplomatic, not political, exercise."}
{"id": "3054", "revid": "1021198220", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3054", "title": "Alpha helix", "text": "The alpha helix (\u03b1-helix) is a common motif in the secondary structure of proteins and is a right hand-helix conformation in which every backbone N\u2212H group hydrogen bonds to the backbone C=O group of the amino acid located four residues earlier along the protein sequence.\nThe alpha helix is also called a classic Pauling\u2013Corey\u2013Branson \u03b1-helix. The name 3.613-helix is also used for this type of helix, denoting the average number of residues per helical turn, with 13 atoms being involved in the ring formed by the hydrogen bond.\nAmong types of local structure in proteins, the \u03b1-helix is the most extreme and the most predictable from sequence, as well as the most prevalent.\nDiscovery.\nIn the early 1930s, William Astbury showed that there were drastic changes in the X-ray fiber diffraction of moist wool or hair fibers upon significant stretching. The data suggested that the unstretched fibers had a coiled molecular structure with a characteristic repeat of \u2248.\nAstbury initially proposed a linked-chain structure for the fibers. He later joined other researchers (notably the American chemist Maurice Huggins) in proposing that:\nAlthough incorrect in their details, Astbury's models of these forms were correct in essence and correspond to modern elements of secondary structure, the \u03b1-helix and the \u03b2-strand (Astbury's nomenclature was kept), which were developed by Linus Pauling, Robert Corey and Herman Branson in 1951 (see below); that paper showed both right- and left-handed helices, although in 1960 the crystal structure of myoglobin showed that the right-handed form is the common one. Hans Neurath was the first to show that Astbury's models could not be correct in detail, because they involved clashes of atoms. Neurath's paper and Astbury's data inspired H. S. Taylor, Maurice Huggins and Bragg and collaborators to propose models of keratin that somewhat resemble the modern \u03b1-helix.\nTwo key developments in the modeling of the modern \u03b1-helix were: the correct bond geometry, thanks to the crystal structure determinations of amino acids and peptides and Pauling's prediction of \"planar\" peptide bonds; and his relinquishing of the assumption of an integral number of residues per turn of the helix. The pivotal moment came in the early spring of 1948, when Pauling caught a cold and went to bed. Being bored, he drew a polypeptide chain of roughly correct dimensions on a strip of paper and folded it into a helix, being careful to maintain the planar peptide bonds. After a few attempts, he produced a model with physically plausible hydrogen bonds. Pauling then worked with Corey and Branson to confirm his model before publication. In 1954, Pauling was awarded his first Nobel Prize \"for his research into the nature of the chemical bond and its application to the elucidation of the structure of complex substances\" (such as proteins), prominently including the structure of the \u03b1-helix.\nStructure.\nGeometry and hydrogen bonding.\nThe amino acids in an \u03b1-helix are arranged in a right-handed helical structure where each amino acid residue corresponds to a 100\u00b0 turn in the helix (i.e., the helix has 3.6 residues per turn), and a translation of along the helical axis. Dunitz describes how Pauling's first article on the theme in fact shows a left-handed helix, the enantiomer of the true structure. Short pieces of left-handed helix sometimes occur with a large content of achiral glycine amino acids, but are unfavorable for the other normal, biological -amino acids. The pitch of the alpha-helix (the vertical distance between consecutive turns of the helix) is , which is the product of 1.5 and 3.6. What is most important is that the N-H group of an amino acid forms a hydrogen bond with the C=O group of the amino acid \"four\" residues earlier; this repeated \"i\"\u00a0+\u00a04 \u2192 \"i\" hydrogen bonding is the most prominent characteristic of an \u03b1-helix. Official international nomenclature specifies two ways of defining \u03b1-helices, rule 6.2 in terms of repeating \"\u03c6\", \"\u03c8\" torsion angles (see below) and rule 6.3 in terms of the combined pattern of pitch and hydrogen bonding. The \u03b1-helices can be identified in protein structure using several computational methods, one of which is DSSP (Define\u00a0Secondary Structure of Protein).\nSimilar structures include the 310 helix (\"i\"\u00a0+\u00a03 \u2192 \"i\" hydrogen bonding) and the \u03c0-helix (\"i\"\u00a0+\u00a05 \u2192 \"i\" hydrogen bonding). The \u03b1-helix can be described as a 3.613 helix, since the \"i\"\u00a0+\u00a04 spacing adds three more atoms to the H-bonded loop compared to the tighter 310 helix, and on average, 3.6 amino acids are involved in one ring of \u03b1-helix. The subscripts refer to the number of atoms (including the hydrogen) in the closed loop formed by the hydrogen bond.\nResidues in \u03b1-helices typically adopt backbone (\"\u03c6\",\u00a0\"\u03c8\") dihedral angles around (\u221260\u00b0,\u00a0\u221245\u00b0), as shown in the image at right. In more general terms, they adopt dihedral angles such that the \"\u03c8\" dihedral angle of one residue and the \"\u03c6\" dihedral angle of the \"next\" residue sum to roughly \u2212105\u00b0. As a consequence, \u03b1-helical dihedral angles, in general, fall on a diagonal stripe on the Ramachandran diagram (of slope \u22121), ranging from (\u221290\u00b0,\u00a0\u221215\u00b0) to (\u221235\u00b0,\u00a0\u221270\u00b0). For comparison, the sum of the dihedral angles for a 310 helix is roughly \u221275\u00b0, whereas that for the \u03c0-helix is roughly \u2212130\u00b0. The general formula for the rotation angle \"\u03a9\" per residue of any polypeptide helix with \"trans\" isomers is given by the equation\nThe \u03b1-helix is tightly packed; there is almost no free space within the helix. The amino-acid side-chains are on the outside of the helix, and point roughly \"downward\" (i.e., toward the N-terminus), like the branches of an evergreen tree (Christmas tree effect). This directionality is sometimes used in preliminary, low-resolution electron-density maps to determine the direction of the protein backbone.\nStability.\nHelices observed in proteins can range from four to over forty residues long, but a typical helix contains about ten amino acids (about three turns). In general, short polypeptides do not exhibit much \u03b1-helical structure in solution, since the entropic cost associated with the folding of the polypeptide chain is not compensated for by a sufficient amount of stabilizing interactions. In general, the backbone hydrogen bonds of \u03b1-helices are considered slightly weaker than those found in \u03b2-sheets, and are readily attacked by the ambient water molecules. However, in more hydrophobic environments such as the plasma membrane, or in the presence of co-solvents such as trifluoroethanol (TFE), or isolated from solvent in the gas phase, oligopeptides readily adopt stable \u03b1-helical structure. Furthermore, crosslinks can be incorporated into peptides to conformationally stabilize helical folds. Crosslinks stabilize the helical state by entropically destabilizing the unfolded state and by removing enthalpically stabilized \"decoy\" folds that compete with the fully helical state. It has been shown that \u03b1-helices are more stable, robust to mutations and designable than \u03b2-strands in natural proteins, and also in artificial designed proteins.\nExperimental determination.\nSince the \u03b1-helix is defined by its hydrogen bonds and backbone conformation, the most detailed experimental evidence for \u03b1-helical structure comes from atomic-resolution X-ray crystallography such as the example shown at right. It is clear that all the backbone carbonyl oxygens point downward (toward the C-terminus) but splay out slightly, and the H-bonds are approximately parallel to the helix axis. Protein structures from NMR spectroscopy also show helices well, with characteristic observations of nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) couplings between atoms on adjacent helical turns. In some cases, the individual hydrogen bonds can be observed directly as a small scalar coupling in NMR.\nThere are several lower-resolution methods for assigning general helical structure. The NMR chemical shifts (in particular of the C\u03b1, C\u03b2 and C\u2032) and residual dipolar couplings are often characteristic of helices. The far-UV (170\u2013250\u00a0nm) circular dichroism spectrum of helices is also idiosyncratic, exhibiting a pronounced double minimum at around 208 and 222\u00a0nm. Infrared spectroscopy is rarely used, since the \u03b1-helical spectrum resembles that of a random coil (although these might be discerned by, e.g., hydrogen-deuterium exchange). Finally, cryo electron microscopy is now capable of discerning individual \u03b1-helices within a protein, although their assignment to residues is still an active area of research.\nLong homopolymers of amino acids often form helices if soluble. Such long, isolated helices can also be detected by other methods, such as dielectric relaxation, flow birefringence, and measurements of the diffusion constant. In stricter terms, these methods detect only the characteristic prolate (long cigar-like) hydrodynamic shape of a helix, or its large dipole moment.\nAmino-acid propensities.\nDifferent amino-acid sequences have different propensities for forming \u03b1-helical structure. Methionine, alanine, leucine, glutamate, and lysine uncharged (\"MALEK\" in the amino-acid 1-letter codes) all have especially high helix-forming propensities, whereas proline and glycine have poor helix-forming propensities. Proline either breaks or kinks a helix, both because it cannot donate an amide hydrogen bond (having no amide hydrogen), and also because its sidechain interferes sterically with the backbone of the preceding turn inside a helix, this forces a bend of about 30\u00b0 in the helix's axis. However, proline is often seen as the \"first\" residue of a helix, it is presumed due to its structural rigidity. At the other extreme, glycine also tends to disrupt helices because its high conformational flexibility makes it entropically expensive to adopt the relatively constrained \u03b1-helical structure.\nTable of standard amino acid alpha-helical propensities.\nEstimated differences in free energy, \u0394(\u0394\"G\"), estimated in kcal/mol per residue in an \u03b1-helical configuration, relative to alanine arbitrarily set as zero. Higher numbers (more positive free energies) are less favoured. Significant deviations from these average numbers are possible, depending on the identities of the neighbouring residues.\nDipole moment.\nA helix has an overall dipole moment due to the aggregate effect of the individual microdipoles from the carbonyl groups of the peptide bond pointing along the helix axis. The effects of this macrodipole are a matter of some controversy. \u03b1-helices often occur with the N-terminal end bound by a negatively charged group, sometimes an amino acid side chain such as glutamate or aspartate, or sometimes a phosphate ion. Some regard the helix macrodipole as interacting electrostatically with such groups. Others feel that this is misleading and it is more realistic to say that the hydrogen bond potential of the free NH groups at the N-terminus of an \u03b1-helix can be satisfied by hydrogen bonding; this can also be regarded as set of interactions between local microdipoles such as .\nCoiled coils.\nCoiled-coil \u03b1 helices are highly stable forms in which two or more helices wrap around each other in a \"supercoil\" structure. Coiled coils contain a highly characteristic sequence motif known as a heptad repeat, in which the motif repeats itself every seven residues along the sequence (\"amino acid\" residues, not DNA base-pairs). The first and especially the fourth residues (known as the \"a\" and \"d\" positions) are almost always hydrophobic; the fourth residue is typically leucine this gives rise to the name of the structural motif called a \"leucine zipper\", which is a type of coiled-coil. These hydrophobic residues pack together in the interior of the helix bundle. In general, the fifth and seventh residues (the \"e\" and \"g\" positions) have opposing charges and form a salt bridge stabilized by electrostatic interactions. Fibrous proteins such as keratin or the \"stalks\" of myosin or kinesin often adopt coiled-coil structures, as do several dimerizing proteins. A pair of coiled-coils a four-helix bundle is a very common structural motif in proteins. For example, it occurs in human growth hormone and several varieties of cytochrome. The Rop protein, which promotes plasmid replication in bacteria, is an interesting case in which a single polypeptide forms a coiled-coil and two monomers assemble to form a four-helix bundle.\nFacial arrangements.\nThe amino acids that make up a particular helix can be plotted on a helical wheel, a representation that illustrates the orientations of the constituent amino acids (see the article for leucine zipper for such a diagram). Often in globular proteins, as well as in specialized structures such as coiled-coils and leucine zippers, an \u03b1-helix will exhibit two \"faces\" one containing predominantly hydrophobic amino acids oriented toward the interior of the protein, in the hydrophobic core, and one containing predominantly polar amino acids oriented toward the solvent-exposed surface of the protein.\nChanges in binding orientation also occur for facially-organized oligopeptides. This pattern is especially common in antimicrobial peptides, and many models have been devised to describe how this relates to their function. Common to many of them is that the hydrophobic face of the antimicrobial peptide forms pores in the plasma membrane after associating with the fatty chains at the membrane core.\nLarger-scale assemblies.\nMyoglobin and hemoglobin, the first two proteins whose structures were solved by X-ray crystallography, have very similar folds made up of about 70% \u03b1-helix, with the rest being non-repetitive regions, or \"loops\" that connect the helices. In classifying proteins by their dominant fold, the Structural Classification of Proteins database maintains a large category specifically for all-\u03b1 proteins.\nHemoglobin then has an even larger-scale quaternary structure, in which the functional oxygen-binding molecule is made up of four subunits.\nFunctional roles.\nDNA binding.\n\u03b1-Helices have particular significance in DNA binding motifs, including helix-turn-helix motifs, leucine zipper motifs and zinc finger motifs. This is because of the convenient structural fact that the diameter of an \u03b1-helix is about including an average set of sidechains, about the same as the width of the major groove in B-form DNA, and also because coiled-coil (or leucine zipper) dimers of helices can readily position a pair of interaction surfaces to contact the sort of symmetrical repeat common in double-helical DNA. An example of both aspects is the transcription factor Max (see image at left), which uses a helical coiled coil to dimerize, positioning another pair of helices for interaction in two successive turns of the DNA major groove.\nMembrane spanning.\n\u03b1-Helices are also the most common protein structure element that crosses biological membranes (transmembrane protein), it is presumed because the helical structure can satisfy all backbone hydrogen-bonds internally, leaving no polar groups exposed to the membrane if the sidechains are hydrophobic. Proteins are sometimes anchored by a single membrane-spanning helix, sometimes by a pair, and sometimes by a helix bundle, most classically consisting of seven helices arranged up-and-down in a ring such as for rhodopsins (see image at right) or for G protein\u2013coupled receptors (GPCRs). The structural stability between pairs of \u03b1-Helical transmembrane domains rely on conserved membrane interhelical packing motifs, for example, the Glycine-xxx-Glycine (or small-xxx-small) motif. \nMechanical properties.\n\u03b1-Helices under axial tensile deformation, a characteristic loading condition that appears in many alpha-helix-rich filaments and tissues, results in a characteristic three-phase behavior of stiff-soft-stiff tangent modulus. Phase I corresponds to the small-deformation regime during which the helix is stretched homogeneously, followed by phase II, in which alpha-helical turns break mediated by the rupture of groups of H-bonds. Phase III is typically associated with large-deformation covalent bond stretching.\nDynamical features.\nAlpha-helices in proteins may have low-frequency accordion-like motion as observed by the Raman spectroscopy and analyzed via the quasi-continuum model. Helices not stabilized by tertiary interactions show dynamic behavior, which can be mainly attributed to helix fraying from the ends.\nHelix\u2013coil transition.\nHomopolymers of amino acids (such as polylysine) can adopt \u03b1-helical structure at low temperature that is \"melted out\" at high temperatures. This helix\u2013coil transition was once thought to be analogous to protein denaturation. The statistical mechanics of this transition can be modeled using an elegant transfer matrix method, characterized by two parameters: the propensity to initiate a helix and the propensity to extend a helix.\nIn art.\nAt least five artists have made explicit reference to the \u03b1-helix in their work: Julie Newdoll in painting and Julian Voss-Andreae, Bathsheba Grossman, Byron Rubin, and Mike Tyka in sculpture.\nSan Francisco area artist Julie Newdoll, who holds a degree in Microbiology with a minor in art, has specialized in paintings inspired by microscopic images and molecules since 1990. Her painting \"Rise of the Alpha Helix\" (2003) features human figures arranged in an \u03b1 helical arrangement. According to the artist, \"the flowers reflect the various types of sidechains that each amino acid holds out to the world\". This same metaphor is also echoed from the scientist's side: \"\u03b2 sheets do not show a stiff repetitious regularity but flow in graceful, twisting curves, and even the \u03b1-helix is regular more in the manner of a flower stem, whose branching nodes show the influence of environment, developmental history, and the evolution of each part to match its own idiosyncratic function.\"\nJulian Voss-Andreae is a German-born sculptor with degrees in experimental physics and sculpture. Since 2001 Voss-Andreae creates \"protein sculptures\" based on protein structure with the \u03b1-helix being one of his preferred objects. Voss-Andreae has made \u03b1-helix sculptures from diverse materials including bamboo and whole trees. A monument Voss-Andreae created in 2004 to celebrate the memory of Linus Pauling, the discoverer of the \u03b1-helix, is fashioned from a large steel beam rearranged in the structure of the \u03b1-helix. The , bright-red sculpture stands in front of Pauling's childhood home in Portland, Oregon.\nRibbon diagrams of \u03b1-helices are a prominent element in the laser-etched crystal sculptures of protein structures created by artist Bathsheba Grossman, such as those of insulin, hemoglobin, and DNA polymerase. Byron Rubin is a former protein crystallographer now professional sculptor in metal of proteins, nucleic acids, and drug molecules many of which featuring \u03b1-helices, such as subtilisin, human growth hormone, and phospholipase A2.\nMike Tyka is a computational biochemist at the University of Washington working with David Baker. Tyka has been making sculptures of protein molecules since 2010 from copper and steel, including ubiquitin and a potassium channel tetramer."}
{"id": "3055", "revid": "3306290", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3055", "title": "Accrington", "text": "Accrington is a town in the Hyndburn borough of Lancashire, England. It lies about east of Blackburn, west of Burnley, east of Preston, north of Manchester city centre and is situated on the mostly culverted River Hyndburn. Commonly abbreviated by locals to \"Accy\", the town has a population of 35,456 according to the 2011 census.\nAccrington is a former centre of the cotton and textile machinery industries. The town is famed for manufacturing the hardest and densest building bricks in the world, \"The Accrington NORI\" (iron), which were used in the construction of the Empire State Building and for the foundations of Blackpool Tower; famous for Accrington Stanley F.C. and the Haworth Art Gallery which holds Europe's largest collection of Tiffany glass.\nHistory.\nOrigin of the name.\nThe name Accrington appears to be Anglo-Saxon in origin. In the records it variously appears as \"Akarinton\" in 1194; \"Akerunton\", \"Akerinton\" and \"Akerynton\" in 1258; \"Acrinton\" in 1292; \"Ackryngton\" in 1311 and \"Acryngton\" in 1324.\nThe name may mean \"acorn farmstead\" from Anglo-Saxon \"\u00e6cern\" meaning \"acorn\" and \"tun\" meaning \"farmstead\" or \"village\". The southern part of Accrington, the township of New Accrington, was formerly in the Forest of Blackburnshire and the presence of oak trees may be inferred from local place names like Broad Oak and Oak Hill. The products of oak trees were once an important food for swine and a farmstead may have been named for such produce. Anglo-Saxon \"\u00c6cerntun\" might become Middle English \"Akerenton\", \"Akerinton\" and the like. Also worth considering is that in the Lancashire dialect \"acorn\" was \"akran\".\nThere is no known Old English personal name from which the first element can be derived. But if the Frisian names \"Akkrum\", \"Akkeringa\" and Dutch name \"Akkerghem\", are derived from the personal name \"Akker\" there may be a corresponding Old English name from which \"Accrington\" may be derived.\nEarly history.\nAccrington covers two townships which were established in 1507 following disafforestation; those of Old Accrington and New Accrington which were merged in 1878 with the incorporation of the borough council. There have been settlements there since the medieval period, likely in the Grange Lane and Black Abbey area, and the King's Highway which passes above the town was at one time used by the kings and queens of England when they used the area for hunting when the Forest of Accrington was one of the four forests of the hundred of Blackburnshire.\nRobert de Lacy gave the manor of Accrington to the monks of Kirkstall in the 12th century. The monks built a grange there; removing the inhabitants to make room for it. The locals got their revenge by setting fire to the new building, destroying its contents and in the process killing the three lay brothers who occupied it. An area of the town is named 'Black Abbey', a possible reference to the murders. Regardless of whatever happened, Accrington did not remain under monastic control for long before reverting to the de Lacys.\nIt is thought the monks of Kirkstall may have built a small chapel there during their tenure for the convenience of those in charge residing there and their tenants, but the records are uncertain. What is known is that there was a chapel in Accrington prior to 1553 where the vicar of Whalley was responsible for the maintenance of divine worship. However it did not have its own minister and it was served, when at all, by the curate of one of the adjacent chapels. In 1717 Accrington was served by the curate of Church, who preached there only once a month. St. James's Church was built in 1763, replacing the old chapel however it did not achieve parochial status until as late as 1870.\nIndustrial Revolution.\nUntil around 1830, visitors considered Accrington to be just a \"considerable village\". The Industrial Revolution, however, resulted in large changes and Accrington's location on the confluence of a number of streams made it attractive to industry and a number of mills were built in the town in the mid-18th century. Further industrialisation then followed in the late-18th century and local landowners began building mansions in the area on the outskirts of the settlement where their mills were located while their employees lived in overcrowded unsanitary conditions in the centre.\nIndustrialisation resulted in rapid population growth during the 19th century, as people moved from over North West England to Accrington, with the population increasing from 3,266 in 1811 to 10,376 in 1851 to 43,211 in 1901 to its peak in 1911 at 45,029.\nThis fast population growth and slow response from the established church allowed non-conformism to flourish in the town. By the mid-19th century, there were Wesleyan, Primitive Methodist, United Free Methodist, Congregationalist, Baptist, Swedenborgian, Unitarian, Roman Catholic and Catholic Apostolic churches in the town. The Swedenborgian church was so grand that it was considered to be the \u2018Cathedral' of that denomination.\nFor many decades the textiles industry, the engineering industry and coal mining were the central activities of the town. Cotton mills and dye works provided work for the inhabitants, but often in very difficult conditions. There was regular conflict with employers over wages and working conditions. On 24 April 1826 over 1,000 men and women, many armed, gathered at Whinney Hill in Clayton-le-Moors to listen to a speaker from where they marched on Sykes's Mill at Higher Grange Lane, near the site of the modern police station and magistrates' courts, and smashed over 60 looms. These riots spread from Accrington through Oswaldtwistle, Blackburn, Darwen, Rossendale, Bury and Chorley. In the end after three days of riots 1,139 looms were destroyed, 4 rioters and 2 bystanders shot dead by the authorities in Rossendale and 41 rioters sentenced to death (all of whose sentences were commuted).\nIn the 1842 'plug riots' a general strike spread from town to town due to conditions in the town. In a population of 9,000 people as few as 100 were fully employed. From 15 August 1842 the situation boiled over and bands of men entered the mills which were running and stopped the machinery by knocking out the boiler plugs. This allowed the water and steam to escape shutting down the mill machinery. Thousands of strikers walked over the hills from one town to another to persuade people to join the strike in civil disturbances that lasted about a week. The strike was associated with the Chartist movement but eventually proved unsuccessful in its aims.\nIn the early 1860s the Lancashire cotton famine badly affected Accrington, although less so than the wider area due to its more diverse economy, with as many as half of the town's mill employees out of work at one time.\nConditions were such that a Local Board of Health was constituted in 1853 and the town itself incorporated in 1878 allowing the enforcement of local laws to improve the town.\nAccrington Pals.\nOne well-known association the town has is with the 'Accrington Pals', the nickname given to the smallest home town battalion of volunteers formed to fight in the First World War. The Pals battalions were a peculiarity of the 1914-18 war: Lord Kitchener, the Secretary of State for War, believed that it would help recruitment if friends and work-mates from the same town were able to join up and fight together. Strictly speaking, the 'Accrington Pals' battalion is properly known as the '11th East Lancashire Regiment': the nickname is a little misleading, since of the four 250-strong companies that made up the original battalion only one was composed of men from Accrington. The rest volunteered from other east Lancashire towns such as Burnley, Blackburn and Chorley.\nThe Pals' first day of action, 1 July 1916, took place in Serre, near Montauban in the north of France. It was part of the 'Big Push' (later known as the Battle of the Somme) that was intended to force the German Army into a retreat from the Western Front, a line they had held since late 1914. The German defences in Serre were supposed to have been obliterated by sustained, heavy, British shelling during the preceding week; however, as the battalion advanced it met with fierce resistance. 235 men were killed and a further 350 wounded \u2014 more than half of the battalion \u2014 within half an hour. Similarly desperate losses were suffered elsewhere on the front, in a disastrous day for the British Army (approximately 19,000 British soldiers were killed in a single day).\nLater in the year, the East Lancashire Regiment was rebuilt with new volunteers \u2014 in all, 865 Accrington men were killed during World War I. All of these names are recorded on a war memorial, an imposing white stone cenotaph, which stands in Oak Hill Park in the south of the town. The cenotaph also lists the names of 173 local fatalities from World War II. The trenches from which the Accrington Pals advanced on 1 July 1916 are still visible in John Copse west of the village of Serre, and there is a memorial there made of Accrington brick.\nAfter the war and until 1986, Accrington Corporation buses were painted in the regimental colours of red and blue with gold lining. The mudguards were painted black as a sign of mourning. The current Mayor of Accrington is Lance Sergeant Gary Archer of the Scots Guards.\nDemography.\nThe 2001 census gave the population of Accrington town as 35,200. The figure for the urban area was 71,220, increased from 70,442 in 1991. This total includes Accrington, Church, Clayton-le-Moors, Great Harwood and Oswaldtwistle. For comparison purposes that is approximately the same size as Aylesbury, Carlisle and Guildford urban areas.\nThe 2011 census gave a population of 35,456 for the Accrington built-up area subdivision (which includes Huncoat, Baxenden and Rising Bridge in Rossendale) and a population of 125,000 for the wider Accrington/Rossendale Built-up area. The area in 2001 was listed as , whereas in 2011 it was .\nThe borough of Hyndburn as a whole has a population of 80,734. This includes Accrington Urban Area and other outlying towns and villages such as; Altham, Rishton, part of Belthorn, and Knuzden and Whitebirk (considered suburbs of Blackburn).\nEconomy.\nFormerly cotton and textile machinery were important industries in the town. NORIs, a type of iron hard engineering brick, were produced nearby in Huncoat which was closed in 2013, but later reopened in 2015. Mills and factories are Accrington's past but there a few factories and garages which now occupy the old buildings.\nAccrington power station was a coal and refuse fired electricity generating station located in Argyle Street adjacent to the gasworks. It supplied electricity to Accrington, Haslingden and the Altham and Clayton-le-Moors areas between 1900 and 1958.\nRegeneration and investment.\nThe council has a regeneration plan in place, which will, according to the council, boost the local economy. The plan is to upgrade many old shops and to build a bus station. A memorial for the Accrington Pals may be built outside the town hall.\nThe Hyndburn Borough Council plans to spend \u00a310 million to refurbish the town centre, which includes:\nHalf of Blackburn Road is being refurbished and is now being made into a more attractive shopping street, upgrading shops, adding more trees, and repaving the pavements.\nAs of 2014, two new phases were being built: the first one called the Acorn Park, where new houses were being built with balconies and greener spaces, and Project Phoenix, which will also include new housing.\nGeography.\nAccrington is a hill town located at the western edge of the Pennines within a bowl and largely encircled by surrounding hills to heights of 300-400m. The Hyndburn or Accrington Brook flows through the centre of the town. Hill settlements origins were as the economic foci of the district engaging in the spinning and weaving of woolen cloth. Wool, lead and coal were other local industries.\nGeographical coordinates: 53\u00b0 46' 0\" North, 2\u00b0 21' 0\" West. Height above sea level: there is a spot height outside the Market Hall which is 133.5m; the bench mark on the side of the neighbouring Town Hall is 441.10 feet. The highest height in the town is 320m which is in Baxenden and the lowest is the town hall which is at 132.5m. most of the town is around 200m.\nTransport.\nThe town has strong local travel links as Accrington railway station lies on the East Lancashire Line serving trains running locally and trains running from Blackpool to York. However, recent changes to the train timetables have been a disservice to Accrington, increasing the journey time to Preston (a vital link to London or Scotland) by up to 1.5 hours. However, there are still buses to Manchester every thirty minutes as well as more frequent services to other towns in east Lancashire. The main road running through the town centre is the A680 running from Rochdale to Whalley. The town is served by junction seven of the M65 and is linked from the A680 and the A56 dual carriageway which briefly merge; linking to the M66 motorway heading towards Manchester. The closest airports are Manchester Airport at , Blackpool Airport at and Leeds Bradford Airport at .\nThere was once a rail link south to Manchester via Haslingden and Bury, but this was closed in the 1960s as part of cuts following the Beeching Report. The trackbed from Accrington to Baxenden is now a linear treelined cycleway/footpath. A train service to Manchester via the Todmorden Curve opened in 2015. A new bus station is being built in Accrington too.\nBus operator Pilkington Bus are based in Accrington, and Holmeswood Coaches, Rosso and Transdev Blazefield subsidiaries Blackburn Bus Company and Burnley Bus Company also provide bus services in the town; routes serve places such as Blackburn, Oswaldtwistle, Rishton, Burnley and Clitheroe. However M&amp;M Coaches ceased business suddenly on 21 September 2016\nPublic services.\nAccrington Library, on St James Street, is a Carnegie library that opened in 1908. It is noted for its stained glass window designed by Gustav Hiller and as a place of inspiration for the young Jeanette Winterson.\nNear the Tesco supermarket, there is Accrington Skate Park which is popular during the school holidays. On Broadway, Accrington Police Station serves the Borough of Hyndburn. In April 2003, Hyndburn Community Fire Station opened, also serving the Borough of Hyndburn.\nLaw enforcement.\nThe town is served by the Lancashire Constabulary Police station on Broadway after moving into town from its previous location on Manchester Road as an effort to save money due to rising expenses and decreasing funding by the government. Crime is very low in Accrington compared to nearby towns.\nPolicing of the Railway station and railway-owned properties is served by the British Transport Police, nearest post in Preston.\nSocial.\nGovernance.\nAccrington is represented in parliament as a part of the constituency of Hyndburn. The constituency boundaries do not align exactly with those of the district of the same name.\nAccrington was first represented nationally after the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885 after the 1885 general election by Accrington (UK Parliament constituency). This seat was abolished in the 1983 general election and replaced with the present constituency of Hyndburn (UK Parliament constituency).\nAccrington became incorporated as a municipal borough in 1878. Under the Local Government Act 1972, since 1974, the town has formed part of the larger Borough of Hyndburn including the former Urban Districts of Oswaldtwistle, Church, Clayton-le-Moors, Great Harwood and Rishton.\nHyndburn consists of 16 wards, electing a total of 35 councillors. Due to its size Accrington is represented by a number of wards in the Borough of Hyndburn. The town largely consists of the Milnshaw, Peel, Central, Barnfield and Spring Hill wards, although some parts of those wards are in other towns in the borough.\nHealth.\nThe local hospital is Accrington Victoria Hospital however, as it only deals with minor issues, Accident and Emergency is provided by the Royal Blackburn Hospital. Other services are provided at the Accrington Pals Primary Health Care Centre and the Accrington Acorn Primary Health Care Centre.\nMedia.\nThe chief publications in the area are the weekly \"Accrington Observer\", part of MEN media, and the \"Lancashire Telegraph\". Accrington Observer is currently stationed within the Market Hall.\nSpecial events.\nA Ron Hill 10K marathon happens every year at the end of March or start of April and is named for the local Olympic runner for Britain Ron Hill. The marathon goes around town and through the local countrysides, and is organised by the council and local businesses. There is also an annual 1K family run which began in 2014. In 2015 more than five hundred runners ran in the race. Their also a race held by the local rotary around August time.\nSport.\nFootball team.\nAccrington Stanley F.C., entered the Football League in 1921 with the formation of the old Third Division (North); after haunting the lower reaches of English football for forty years, they eventually resigned from the League in 1962, due to financial problems, and folded in 1965. The club was reformed three years later and then worked its way through the non-league divisions to reach the Nationwide Conference in 2003. In the 2005\u201306 season, Stanley, after winning against Woking with three matches to spare, secured a place back in the Football League and the town celebrated with a small parade and honours placed on senior executives of the team. One of the teams relegated\u2014and thus being replaced by Stanley\u2014were Oxford United, who were voted into the Football League to replace the previous Accrington Stanley. The football stadium is called the Crown Ground. Until the 2012\u201313 season, when Fleetwood Town entered the league, Accrington was the smallest town in England and Wales with a Football League club.\nAccrington Stanley Football Club has had its own pub in the town, the Crown, since July 2007.\nTeam history.\nAn earlier club, Accrington F.C., were one of the twelve founder members of the Football League in 1888. However, their time in league football was even less successful and considerably briefer than that of Accrington Stanley: they dropped out of the league in 1893 and folded shortly afterwards due to financial problems. The town of Accrington thus has the unique \"distinction\" of having lost two separate clubs from league football. They are currently placed in EFL League One after winning the EFL League Two title in the 2017/18 season.\nCricket.\nAccrington Cricket Club plays at Thorneyholme Road in the Lancashire League. Cricket is also played in parks. Schools nearby have shown major interest in cricket and have held cricket training and tournaments.\nGolf.\nAccrington has a golf course.\nRugby League.\nAccrington Wildcats is a junior rugby league club formed in 2007.\nOther sports.\nThere are many gyms in the town and the council has held fitness classes for the women and old people. There are two sports centres, the main one being the Hyndburn Sports Centre, which recently renovated their swimming pool area and is situated near Lidl.\nEducation.\nAccrington has the following primary schools:\nThe secondary schools serving Accrington are:\nThe college in the town centre is Accrington and Rossendale College; nearby universities include University Centre at Blackburn College, and the University of Central Lancashire in Preston.\nLandmarks.\nThe Haworth Art Gallery was previously a mansion named as Hollins Hill Mansion. The museum houses a collection of Tiffany glassware presented to the town by Joseph Briggs, an Accrington man who had joined Tiffany's in the late 19th century and eventually became art director and assistant manager. It is situated in Haworth Park on Manchester Road.\nThe Viaduct is a bridge which has a railway line on it, it goes through the town and has many storage units and shop on sale by National Rail. The Viaduct ends at the Accrington Eco Station.\nAccrington Town Hall was built in memory of Sir Robert Peel and opened as the Peel Institute in 1858; it is also listed.\nThe Arcade is a Victorian shopping Centre with about 10-15 outlets and has many restaurants there. It is on Church street near the town hall. The arcade has hardware shops and shops like Argos. There are some restaurants in there too. Sadly most outlets are closing since the year 2013. In 2016, there was a revamp of the Arcade which saw specialist shops such as Darts, Vinyl and Knitted Wear added into the Arcade. \nOakhill Park is a large and old park with a sceneric view of Accrington. It has won many awards such as the best park in Lancashire. It has also been awarded an Eco Award. The Haworth Art Gallery is in the park. It is on Manchester Road.\nPeel Park is a park in Accrington which was opened by William Peel on 29 September 1909. The Coppice is a hill within the park, and provides a 2.2 mile scenic walk around the park. There was a centenary celebration marking 100 years from the Coppice being handed over to the people of Accrington on 26 September 2009. There was also a refurbishment of the paths and monument at the top of the Coppice at this time. Since then there has been several revamps to the Playground area of the park."}

{"id": "3058", "revid": "9784415", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3058", "title": "Armageddon", "text": "According to the Book of Revelation in the New Testament of the Christian Bible, Armageddon (, from \"Harmaged\u014dn\", Late Latin: , from Hebrew: \"Har M\u0259g\u012bdd\u014d\") is the prophesied location of a gathering of armies for a battle during the end times, which is variously interpreted as either a literal or a symbolic location. The term is also used in a generic sense to refer to any end of the world scenario. In Islamic theology, the Armageddon is also mentioned in Hadith as the Greatest Armageddon or Al-Malhama Al-Kubra (the great battle).\nThe \"mount\" of Megiddo in northern Israel is not actually a mountain, but a tell (a mound or hill created by many generations of people living and rebuilding on the same spot) on which ancient forts were built to guard the Via Maris, an ancient trade route linking Egypt with the northern empires of Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia. Megiddo was the location of various ancient battles, including one in the 15th century BC and one in 609 BC. The nearby modern Megiddo is a kibbutz in the Kishon River area.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"Armageddon\" appears only once in the Greek New Testament, in Revelation 16:16. The word is a Greek transliteration of the Hebrew \"har m\u0259gidd\u00f4\" (). \"Har\" means \"a mountain or range of hills\". This is a shortened form of \"harar\" meaning \"to loom up; a mountain\". \"Megiddo\" refers to a fortification made by King Ahab that dominated the Plain of Jezreel. Its name means \"place of crowds\".\nChristianity.\nMegiddo is mentioned twelve times in the Old Testament, ten times in reference to the ancient city of Megiddo, and twice with reference to \"the plain of Megiddo\", most probably simply meaning \"the plain next to the city\". None of these Old Testament passages describes the city of Megiddo as being associated with any particular prophetic beliefs. The one New Testament reference to the city of Armageddon found in also makes no specific mention of any armies being predicted to one day gather in this city, but instead seems to predict only that \"they (will gather) the kings together to... Armageddon\". The text does however seem to imply, based on the text from the earlier passage of Revelation 16:14, that the purpose of this gathering of kings in the \"place called Armageddon\" is \"for the war of the great day of God, the Almighty.\" Because of the seemingly highly symbolic and even cryptic language of this one New Testament passage, some Christian scholars conclude that Mount Armageddon must be an idealized location. R. J. Rushdoony says, \"There are no mountains of Megiddo, only the Plains of Megiddo. This is a deliberate destruction of the vision of any literal reference to the place.\" Other scholars, including C. C. Torrey, Kline and Jordan argue that the word is derived from the Hebrew \"moed\" (), meaning \"assembly\".\u00a0 Thus, \"Armageddon\" would mean \"Mountain of Assembly,\" which Jordan says is \"a reference to the assembly at Mount Sinai, and to its replacement, Mount Zion.\"\nMost traditions interpret this Bible prophecy to be symbolic of the progression of the world toward the \"great day of God, the Almighty\" in which God pours out his just and holy wrath against unrepentant sinners, led by Satan, in a literal end-of-the-world final confrontation. Armageddon is the symbolic name given to this event based on scripture references regarding divine obliteration of God's enemies. The hermeneutical method supports this position by referencing Judges 4 and 5 where God miraculously destroys the enemy of their elect, Israel, at Megiddo.\nChristian scholar William Hendriksen writes:\nDispensationalism.\nIn his discussion of Armageddon, J. Dwight Pentecost has devoted a chapter to the subject, \"The Campaign of Armageddon\", in which he discusses it as a campaign and not a specific battle, which will be fought in the Middle East. Pentecost writes:\nPentecost then discusses the location of this campaign, and mentions the \"hill of Megiddo\" and other geographic locations such as \"the valley of Jehoshaphat\" and \"the valley of the passengers\", \"Lord coming from Edom or Idumea, south of Jerusalem, when he returns from the judgment\"; and Jerusalem itself.\nPentecost further describes the area involved:\nPentecost then outlines the biblical time period for this campaign to occur and with further arguments concludes that it must take place with the 70th week of Daniel. The invasion of Israel by the Northern Confederacy \"will bring the Beast and his armies to the defense of Israel as her protector\". He then uses Daniel to further clarify his thinking.\nAgain, events are listed by Pentecost in his book:\nAfter the destruction of the Beast at the Second Coming of Jesus, the promised Kingdom is set up, in which Jesus and the saints will rule for a thousand years. Satan is then loosed \"for a season\" and goes out to deceive the nations, specifically, Gog and Magog. The army mentioned attacks the saints in the New Jerusalem, they are defeated by a judgment of fire coming down from heaven, and then comes the Great White Throne judgment, which includes all of those through the ages and these are cast into the Lake of Fire, which event is also known as the \"second death\" and Gehenna, not to be confused with Hell, which is Satan's domain. Pentecost describes this as follows:\nJehovah's Witnesses.\nJehovah's Witnesses believe that Armageddon is the means by which God will fulfill his purpose for the Earth to be populated with happy healthy humans who will be free from sin and death. They teach that the armies of heaven will eradicate all who oppose the Kingdom of God, wiping out all wicked humans on Earth, only leaving righteous mankind.\nThey believe that the gathering of all of the nations of the earth refers to the uniting of the world's political powers, as a gradual process which began in 1914 and was later seen in manifestations such as the League of Nations and the United Nations following the First and Second World Wars. These political powers are said to be influenced by Satan and his demons in opposition to God's kingdom. Babylon the Great is interpreted as being the world empire of false religions, and it will be destroyed by the beast just prior to Armageddon. Witnesses believe that after all other religions have been destroyed, the governments of the world will begin persecuting Witnesses, and God will then intervene, precipitating Armageddon.\nJehovah's Witnesses teach that the armies of heaven, led by Jesus, will then destroy all forms of human government and then Jesus, along with a selected 144,000 humans, will rule Earth for 1,000 years. They believe that Satan and his demons will be bound for that period, unable to influence mankind. After the 1,000 years are ended, and the second resurrection has taken place, Satan is released and allowed to tempt the perfect human race one last time. Those who follow Satan will be destroyed, along with him, leaving the earth, and humankind at peace with God forever, free from sin and death.\nThe religion's current teaching on Armageddon originated in 1925 with former Watch Tower Society president J. F. Rutherford, who based his interpretations on passages that are found in the books of Exodus, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Psalms as well as additional passages that are found in the books of Samuel, Kings and Chronicles. The doctrine marked a further break from the teachings of the Watch Tower Society's founder Charles Taze Russell, who for decades had taught that the final war would be an anarchistic struggle for domination on earth. Tony Wills, the author of a historical study of Jehovah's Witnesses, wrote that Rutherford seemed to relish his descriptions of how completely the wicked would be destroyed at Armageddon, dwelling at great length on prophecies of destruction. He stated that towards the close of his ministry, Rutherford allocated about half the space that was available in \"The Watchtower\" magazines to discussions about Armageddon.\nSeventh-day Adventist.\nThe teachings of the Seventh-day Adventist Church state that the terms \"Armageddon\", \"Day of the Lord\" and \"The Second Coming of Christ\" all describe the same event. Seventh-day Adventists further teach that the current religious movements taking place in the world are setting the stage for Armageddon, and they are concerned by an anticipated unity between spiritualism, American Protestantism and Roman Catholicism. A further significant difference in Seventh-day Adventist theology is the teaching that the events of Armageddon will leave the earth desolate for the duration of the millennium. They teach that the righteous will be taken to heaven while the rest of humanity will be destroyed, leaving Satan with no one to tempt and effectively \"bound.\" The final re-creation of a \"new heaven and a new earth.\" then follows the millennium.\nChristadelphians.\nFor Christadelphians, Armageddon marks the \"great climax of history when the nations would be gathered together 'into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon', and the judgment on them would herald the setting up of the Kingdom of God.\"\nBah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith.\nFrom Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed literature, a number of interpretations of the expectations surrounding the Battle of Armageddon may be inferred, three of them being associated with events surrounding the World Wars.\nThe first interpretation deals with a series of tablets written by Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h, founder of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, to be sent to various kings and rulers. The second, and best-known one, relates to events near the end of World War I involving General Allenby and the Battle of Megiddo (1918) wherein World Powers are said to have drawn soldiers from many parts of the world to engage in battle at Megiddo. In winning this battle Allenby also prevented the Ottomans from killing 'Abdu'l-Baha, then head of the Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed Faith, whom they had intended to crucify.

{"id": "3060", "revid": "39515155", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3060", "title": "Athlon", "text": "Athlon is the brand name applied to a series of x86-compatible microprocessors designed and manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). The original Athlon (now called Athlon Classic) was the first seventh-generation x86 processor and was the first desktop processor to reach speeds of one gigahertz (GHz). It made its debut as AMD's high-end processor brand on June 23, 1999. Over the years AMD has used the Athlon name with the 64-bit Athlon 64 architecture, the Athlon II, and Accelerated Processing Unit (APU) chips targeting the Socket AM1 desktop SoC architecture, and Socket AM4 Zen microarchitecture. The modern Zen-based Athlon with a Radeon Graphics processor was introduced in 2019 as AMD's highest-performance entry-level processor.\nAthlon comes from the Ancient Greek (\"athlon\") meaning \"(sport) contest\", or \"prize of a contest\", or \"place of a contest; arena\". With the Athlon name originally used for AMD's mid-range processors with combined CPU/GPU processors with the GPU disabled, AMD currently uses Athlon for budget APUs with integrated graphics. AMD positions the\u00a0Athlon\u00a0against its rival, the Intel Pentium.\nBrand history.\nK7 design and development.\nThe first\u00a0Athlon\u00a0processor was a result of AMD's development of K7 processors in the 1990s. AMD founder and then-CEO Jerry Sanders aggressively pursued strategic partnerships and engineering talent in the late 1990s, working to build on earlier successes in the PC market with the AMD K6 processor line. One major partnership announced in 1998 paired AMD with semiconductor giant Motorola to co-develop copper-based semiconductor technology, resulting in the K7 project being the first commercial processor to utilize copper fabrication technology. In the announcement, Sanders referred to the partnership as creating a \"virtual gorilla\" that would enable AMD to compete with Intel on fabrication capacity while limiting AMD's financial outlay for new facilities. The K7 design team was led by Dirk Meyer, who had previously worked as a lead engineer at DEC on multiple Alpha microprocessors. When DEC was sold to Compaq in 1998 and discontinued Alpha processor development, and Sanders brought most of the Alpha design team to the K7 project. This added to the previously acquired NexGen K6 team, which already included engineers such as Vinod Dham.\nOriginal release.\nThe AMD\u00a0Athlon\u00a0processor launched on June 23, 1999, with general availability by August 1999. Subsequently, from August 1999 until January 2002, this initial K7 processor was the fastest x86 chip in the world. Wrote the \"Los Angeles Times\" on October 5, 1999, \"AMD has historically trailed Intel\u2019s fastest processors, but has overtaken the industry leader with the new\u00a0Athlon. Analysts say the\u00a0Athlon, which will be used by Compaq Computer, IBM and other manufacturers in their most powerful PCs, is significantly faster than Intel\u2019s flagship Pentium III, which runs at a top speed of 600MHz.\" A number of features helped the chips compete with Intel. By working with Motorola, AMD had been able to refine copper interconnect manufacturing about one year before Intel, with the revised process permitting 180-nanometer processor production. The accompanying die-shrink resulted in lower power consumption, permitting AMD to increase\u00a0Athlon\u00a0clock speeds to the 1\u00a0GHz range. The\u00a0Athlon\u00a0architecture also used the EV6 bus licensed from DEC as its main system bus, allowing AMD to develop its own products without needing to license Intel's GTL+ bus. By the summer of 2000, AMD was shipping\u00a0Athlons\u00a0at high volume and the chips were being used in systems by Gateway, Hewlett-Packard, and Fujitsu Siemens Computers among others.\nLater\u00a0Athlon\u00a0iterations.\nThe second generation\u00a0Athlon, the Thunderbird, debuted in 2000. AMD released the\u00a0Athlon\u00a0XP the following year, and the\u00a0Athlon\u00a0XP's immediate successor, the Athlon\u00a064, was an AMD64-architecture microprocessor released in 2003. While the\u00a0Athlon\u00a0name was originally used for combined CPU/GPU processors with the GPU disabled, after the 2007 launch of the Phenom processors, the Athlon name was also used for mid-range processors, positioned above brands such as Sempron. The Athlon\u00a064 X2 was released in 2005 as the first native dual-core desktop CPU designed by AMD, and the Athlon\u00a0X2 was a subsequent family based on the\u00a0Athlon\u00a064 X2. \u00a0Introduced in 2009, Athlon\u00a0II was a dual-core family of\u00a0Athlon\u00a0chips.\nA USD$55 low-power Athlon 200GE with a Radeon graphics processor was introduced in September 2018, sitting under the Ryzen 3 2200G. This iteration of\u00a0Athlon\u00a0used AMD's Zen-based \"Raven Ridge\" core, which in turn had debuted in Ryzen with Radeon graphics processors. With the release, AMD began using the Athlon brand name to refer to \"low cost, high volume products,\" in a situation similar to both Intel's Celeron and Pentium Gold. The modern Athlon 3000G was introduced in 2019, and was positioned as AMD's highest-performance entry-level processor. AMD positions the\u00a0Athlon\u00a0against its rival, the Intel Pentium. While CPU processing performance is in the same ballpark, the\u00a0Athlon\u00a03000G uses Radeon Vega graphics, which are rated as more powerful than the Pentium's Intel UHD Graphics.\nGenerations.\nAthlon\u00a0Classic (1999).\nThe AMD\u00a0Athlon\u00a0processor launched on June 23, 1999, with general availability by August 1999. Subsequently, from August 1999 until January 2002, this initial K7 processor was the fastest x86 chip in the world. At launch it was, on average, 10% faster than the Pentium III at the same clock for business applications, and 20% faster for gaming workloads. In commercial terms, the Athlon \"Classic\" was an enormous success.\nThe\u00a0Athlon\u00a0Classic is a cartridge-based processor, named Slot A and similar to Intel's cartridge Slot 1 used for Pentium II and Pentium III. It used the same, commonly available, physical 242 pin connector used by Intel Slot 1 processors but rotated by 180 degrees to connect the processor to the motherboard. The cartridge assembly allowed the use of higher speed cache memory modules than could be put on (or reasonably bundled with) motherboards at the time. Similar to the Pentium II and the Katmai-based Pentium III, the\u00a0Athlon\u00a0Classic contained 512\u00a0KB of L2 cache. This high-speed SRAM cache was run at a divisor of the processor clock and was accessed via its own 64-bit back-side bus, allowing the processor to service both front-side bus requests and cache accesses simultaneously, as compared to pushing \"everything\" through the front-side bus.\nThe Argon-based\u00a0Athlon\u00a0contained 22 million transistors and measured 184\u00a0mm2. It was fabricated by AMD in a version of their CS44E process, a 0.25\u00a0\u03bcm complementary metal\u2013oxide\u2013semiconductor (CMOS) process with six levels of aluminium interconnect. \"Pluto\" and \"Orion\" Athlons were fabricated in a 0.18\u00a0\u03bcm process.\nThe Athlon's CPU cache consisted of the typical two levels. Athlon was the first x86 processor with a 128\u00a0KB split level 1 cache; a 2-way associative cache separated into 2\u00d764\u00a0KB for data and instructions (a concept from Harvard architecture). SRAM cache designs at the time were incapable of keeping up with the\u00a0Athlon's clock scalability, resulting in compromised CPU clock speeds in some computers. With later\u00a0Athlon\u00a0models, AMD would integrate the L2 cache onto the processor itself, removing dependence on external cache chips. The Slot-A\u00a0Athlons\u00a0were the first multiplier-locked CPUs from AMD, preventing users from settting their own desired clock speed. This was done by AMD in part to hinder CPU remarking and overclocking by resellers, which could result in inconsistent performance. Eventually a product called the \"Goldfingers device\" was created that could unlock the CPU.\nAMD designed the CPU with more robust x86 instruction decoding capabilities than that of K6, to enhance its ability to keep more data in-flight at once. The critical branch predictor unit was enhanced compared to the K6. Deeper pipelining with more stages allowed higher clock speeds to be attained. Like the AMD K5 and K6, the\u00a0Athlon\u00a0dynamically buffered internal micro-instructions at runtime resulting from parallel x86 instruction decoding. The CPU is an out-of-order design, again like previous post-5x86 AMD CPUs. The\u00a0Athlon\u00a0utilizes the Alpha 21264's EV6 bus architecture with double data rate (DDR) technology.\nAMD ended its long-time handicap with floating point x87 performance by designing a super-pipelined, out-of-order, triple-issue floating point unit (FPU). Each of its three units could independently calculate an optimal type of instructions with some redundancy, making it possible to operate on more than one floating point instruction at once. This FPU was a huge step forward for AMD, helping compete with Intel's P6 FPU. The 3DNow! floating point SIMD technology, again present, received some revisions and was renamed \"Enhanced 3DNow!\" Additions included DSP instructions and the extended MMX subset of Intel SSE.\nAthlon\u00a0Thunderbird (2000-2001).\nThe second generation\u00a0Athlon, the Thunderbird or T-Bird, debuted on June 4, 2000. This version of the\u00a0Athlon\u00a0had a traditional pin-grid array (PGA) format that plugged into a socket (\"Socket A\") on the motherboard or the slot A package. The major difference between it and the\u00a0Athlon\u00a0Classic was cache design, with AMD adding in 256\u00a0KB of on-chip, full-speed exclusive cache. In moving to an exclusive cache design, the L1 cache's contents were not duplicated in the L2, increasing total cache size and functionally creating a large L1 cache with a slower region (the L2) and a fast region (the L1), making the L2 cache into basically a victim cache. With the new cache design, need for high L2 performance and size was lessened, and the simpler L2 cache was less likely to cause clock scaling and yield issues. Thunderbird also moved to a 16-way associative layout.\nThe Thunderbird was \"cherished by many for its overclockability,\" and proved commercially successful, as AMD's most successful product since the Am386DX-40 ten years earlier. AMD's new fab facility in Dresden increased production for AMD overall and put out Thunderbirds at a fast rate, with the process technology improved by a switch to copper interconnects. After several versions were released in 2000 and 2001 of the Thunderbird, the last\u00a0Athlon\u00a0processor using the Thunderbird core was released in 2001 in the summer, at which point speeds were at 1.4 GHz.\nThe locked multipliers of Socket A Thunderbirds could often be disabled through adding conductive bridges on the surface on the chip, a practice widely known as \"the pencil trick\".\nAthlon\u00a0XP (2001-2003).\nOverall, there are four main variants of the\u00a0Athlon\u00a0XP desktop CPU: the \"Palomino,\" the \"Thoroughbred,\" the \"Thorton,\" and the \"Barton.\" A number of mobile processors were also released, including the \"Corvette\" models, and the \"Dublin\" model among others.\n\"Palomino\".\nOn May 14, 2001, AMD released the Athlon\u00a0XP processor. It debuted as the Mobile\u00a0Athlon\u00a04, a mobile version codenamed \"Corvette\" with the desktop\u00a0Athlon\u00a0XP released in the fall. \u00a0The third-generation\u00a0Athlon, code-named \"Palomino\", came out on October 9, 2001 as the\u00a0Athlon\u00a0XP, with the suffix signifying \"extended performance\" and unofficially referencing Windows XP. \"Palomino's\" design used 180\u00a0nm fabrication process size. The\u00a0Athlon\u00a0XP was marketed using a performance rating (PR) system comparing it to the Thunderbird predecessor core. Among other changes, \"Palomino\" consumed 20% less power than the Thunderbird, \u00a0comparatively reducing heat output, and was roughly 10% faster than Thunderbird. \"Palomino\" also had enhanced K7's TLB architecture and included a hardware data prefetch mechanism to take better advantage of memory bandwidth. \"Palomino\" was the first K7 core to include the full SSE instruction set from the Intel Pentium III, as well as AMD's 3DNow! Professional. \"Palomino\" was also the first socketed\u00a0Athlon\u00a0officially supporting dual processing, with chips certified for that purpose branded as the Athlon\u00a0MP (multi processing), which had different specifications. According to HardwareZone, it was possible to modify the\u00a0Athlon\u00a0XP to function as an MP.\n\"Thoroughbred\".\nThe fourth-generation of\u00a0Athlon\u00a0was introduced with the \"Thoroughbred\" core, or \"T-Bred,\" on April 17, 2002. The \"Thoroughbred\" core marked AMD's first production 130\u00a0nm silicon, with smaller die size than its predecessor. There came to be two steppings (revisions) of this core commonly referred to as \"Tbred-A\" and \"Tbred-B\". Introduced in June 2002, the initial A version was mostly a direct die shrink of the preceding \"Palomino\" core, but did not significantly increase clock speeds over the \"Palomino\". A revised \"Thoroughbred\" core, \"Thoroughbred-B\", added a ninth \"metal layer\" to the eight-layered \"Thoroughbred-A\", offering improvement in headroom over the A and making it popular for overclocking.\n\"Barton / Thorton\".\nFifth-generation\u00a0Athlon\u00a0\"Barton\"-core processors were released in early 2003. While not operating at higher clock rates than \"Thoroughbred\"-core processors, they featured an increased L2 cache, and later models had an increased 200\u00a0MHz (400\u00a0MT/s) front side bus. The \"Thorton\" core, a portmanteau of \"Thoroughbred\" and \"Barton\", was a later variant of the \"Barton\" with half of the L2 cache disabled. The \"Barton\" was used to officially introduce a higher 400\u00a0MT/s bus clock for the Socket A platform, which was used to gain some \"Barton\" models more efficiency. By this point with the \"Barton\", the four-year-old\u00a0Athlon\u00a0EV6 bus architecture had scaled to its limit and required a redesign to exceed the performance of newer Intel processors. By 2003, the Pentium 4 had become more than competitive with AMD's processors, and \"Barton\" only saw a small performance increase over the \"Thoroughbred-B\" it derived from, insufficient to outperform the Pentium 4. The K7 derived\u00a0Athlons\u00a0such as \"Barton\" were replaced in September 2003 by the Athlon\u00a064 family, which featured an on-chip memory controller and a new HyperTransport bus.\nNotably, the 2500+ Barton with 11x multiplier was effectively identical to the 3200+ part other than the FSB speed it was binned for meaning seamless overlocking was possible more often than not. Early Thortons could be restored to the full Barton specification with the enabling of the other half of the L2 cache from a slight CPU surface modification but the result was not always reliable.\n\"Barton (130\u00a0nm)\"\n\"Thorton (130\u00a0nm)\"\nMobile Athlon XP.\nThe \"Palomino\" core debuted in the mobile market before the PC market, where it was branded as Mobile\u00a0Athlon\u00a04 with the codename \"Corvette\". It distinctively used a ceramic interposer much like the \"Thunderbird\" instead of the organic pin grid array package used on all later \"Palomino\" processors. In November 2001, AMD released a 1.2\u00a0GHz\u00a0Athlon\u00a04 and a 950\u00a0MHz Duron. The Mobile\u00a0Athlon\u00a04 processors included the PowerNow! function, which controlled a laptop's \"level of processor performance by dynamically adjusting its operating frequency and voltage according to the task at hand,\" thus extending \"battery life by reducing processor power when it isn't needed by applications.\" Duron chips also included PowerNow! In 2002, AMD released a version of PowerNow! called Cool'n'Quiet, implemented on the\u00a0Athlon\u00a0XP but only adjusting clock speed frequency instead of voltage.\nIn 2002 the Athlon\u00a0XP-M (Mobile\u00a0Athlon\u00a0XP) replaced the Mobile\u00a0Athlon\u00a04 using the newer \"Thoroughbred\" core, with \"Barton\" cores for full-size notebooks. The\u00a0Athlon\u00a0XP-M was also offered in a compact microPGA socket 563 version. Mobile XPs were not multiplier-locked, making them popular with desktop overclockers.\nAthlon\u00a064 (2003-2009).\nThe immediate successor to the\u00a0Athlon\u00a0XP, the Athlon\u00a064 is an AMD64-architecture microprocessor produced by AMD, released on September 23, 2003. A number of variations, all named after cities, were released with 90\u00a0nm architecture in 2004 and 2005. Versions released in 2007 and 2009 utilized 65\u00a0nm architecture.\nAthlon\u00a064 X2 (2005-2009).\nThe Athlon\u00a064 X2 was released in 2005 as the first native dual-core desktop CPU designed by AMD using an\u00a0Athlon\u00a064. The Athlon\u00a0X2 was a subsequent family of microprocessors based on the\u00a0Athlon\u00a064 X2. The original \"Brisbane\"\u00a0Athlon\u00a0X2 models used 65\u00a0nm architecture, and were released in 2007.\nAthlon\u00a0II (2009-2012).\nAthlon\u00a0II is a family of central processing units. Initially a dual-core version of the\u00a0Athlon\u00a0II, the K-10-based \"Regor\" was released in June 2009 with 45 nanometer architecture. This was followed by a single-core version, \"Sargas\", followed by the quad-core \"Propus\", the triple-core \"Rana\" in November 2009, and the \"Llano\" 32\u00a0nm version released in 2011.\nZen-based\u00a0Athlon\u00a0(2018-present).\nThe Zen-based Athlon with Radeon graphics processors was launched in September 2018 with the Athlon 200GE. Based on AMD's \"Raven Ridge\" core previously used in variants of the Ryzen 3 and Ryzen 5, the\u00a0Athlon\u00a0200GE had half of the cores but left SMT enabled. It also kept the same 4 mb L3 cache, but the L2 cache was halved to 1 mb.\nIn addition, the number of graphics compute units was limited to 3 in the\u00a0Athlon\u00a0200GE, and the chip was multiplier-locked. Despite its limitations, the\u00a0Athlon\u00a0200GE performed competitively against the 5000-series Intel Pentium-G, displaying similar CPU performance but an advantage in GPU performance.\nOn November 19, 2019, AMD released the Athlon 3000G, with a higher 3.5\u00a0GHz core clock and 1100\u00a0MHz graphics clock compared to the Athlon 200GE also with two cores. The main functional difference between the 200GE was the Athlon 3000G's unlocked multiplier, allowing the latter to be overclocked on B450 and X470 motherboards.\nSpecifications \"(see Zen desktop APUs for more details)\"\n&lt;br&gt;\"Raven Ridge\" (14\u00a0nm), \"Picasso\" (12\u00a0nm)\nSupercomputers.\nA number of supercomputers have been built using\u00a0Athlon\u00a0chips, largely at universities.

He was born in Hebron during his father's reign in Judah. He was the heir apparent to the throne of Israel until he was assassinated by his half-brother Absalom to avenge the rape of their sister Tamar.\nBiblical account.\nAmnon's background.\nAmnon was born in Hebron to Ahinoam and King David. As the presumptive heir to the throne of Israel, Amnon enjoyed a life of power and privilege.\nRape of Tamar.\nAlthough he was the heir-apparent to David's throne, Amnon is best remembered for the rape of his half-sister Tamar, daughter of David and Maachah. Despite the biblical prohibition on sexual relations between half siblings, Amnon had an overwhelming desire for her. He acted on advice from his cousin, Jonadab son of Shimeah, David's brother, to lure Tamar into his quarters by pretending to be sick and desiring her to cook a special meal for him. While in his quarters, and over her protests, he raped her, then had her expelled from his house. While King David was angry about the incident, he could not bring himself to punish his eldest son, while Absalom, Amnon's half-brother and Tamar's full brother, nursed a bitter grudge against Amnon for the rape of his sister.\nAccording to Michael D. Coogan's claims, however, it would have been perfectly all right for Amnon to have married his sister (he claims that the Bible was incoherent about prohibiting incest).\nAccording to the Torah, per Leviticus 18, \"the children of Israel\" -- Israelite men and women alike -- are forbidden from sexual relations between people who are \"near of kin\" (cf. verse 6). Siblings and half siblings (cf. verses 9 and 11). Relationships between these are particularly singled out for a curse in Deuteronomy 27, and they are of the only two kinds incestuous relationships that are among the particularly-singled-out relationships\u2014with the other particularly-singled-out relationships, being ones of non-incestuous family betrayal (cf. verse 20) and bestiality (cf. verse 21). Incestuous relationships are considered so severe among c\"hillul hashem\", acts which bring shame to the name of God, as to be, along with the other forbidden relationships that are mentioned in Leviticus 18, punishable by death as specified in Leviticus 20.\nTwo years later, to avenge Tamar, Absalom invited all of David's sons to a feast at sheep-shearing time, then had his servants kill Amnon after he had become drunk with wine. As a result, Absalom fled to Geshur.\n records that in time David came to terms with the death of Amnon, his first-born. Methodist founder John Wesley is critical of David: \"He can almost find in his heart to receive into favour the murderer of his brother. How can we excuse David from the sin of Eli, who honoured his sons more than God?\"\nDeath.\nIbn Kathir, a famous Islamic historian, notes Gujrat, Pakistan to be the burial place of Amnon. Khawaja Gohor din or Hafiz Sham-ud-din Ghulyanvi first identified the tomb."}

{"id": "3067", "revid": "39639194", "url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=3067", "title": "Amu Darya", "text": "The Amu Darya (also called the Amu, Amo River, or Jay-hoon, and historically known by its Latin name or Greek ) is a major river in Central Asia and Afghanistan. Rising in the Pamir Mountains, north of the Hindu Kush, the Amu Darya is formed by the confluence of the Vakhsh and Panj rivers, in the Tigrovaya Balka Nature Reserve on the border between Afghanistan and Tajikistan, and flows from there north-westwards into the southern remnants of the Aral Sea. In its upper course, the river forms part of Afghanistan's northern border with Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan. In ancient history, the river was regarded as the boundary of Greater Iran with \"Turan\", which roughly corresponded to present-day Central Asia.\nNames.\nIn classical antiquity, the river was known as the in Latin and () in Greek \u2014 a clear derivative of Vakhsh, the name of the largest tributary of the river. In Vedic Sanskrit, the river is also referred to as (). The Brahmanda Purana refers to the river as . The Avestan texts too refer to the River as Yakhsha/Vakhsha (and Yakhsha Arta (\"upper Yakhsha\") referring to the Jaxartes/Syr Darya twin river to Amu Darya). In Middle Persian sources of the Sassanid period the river is known as (lit. 'good river'). Amu Darya, has a flow of about 70 cubic kilometres per year on average. \nThe name \"Amu\" is said to have come from the medieval city of \"\u0100mul\", (later, Chahar Joy/Charjunow, and now known as T\u00fcrkmenabat), in modern Turkmenistan, with \"Darya\" being the Persian word for \"river\". Medieval Arabic and Islamic sources call the river \"Jayhoun\" (; also \"Jaihun\", \"Jayhoon\", or \"Dzhaykhun\") which is derived from \"Gihon\", the biblical name for one of the four rivers of the Garden of Eden. River Amu Darya passes through one of the\u00a0world's highest deserts.\nAs the river Gozan.\nWestern travelers in the 19th century mentioned that one of the names by which the river was known in Afghanistan was \"Gozan\", and that this name was used by Greek, Mongol, Chinese, Persian, Jewish, and Afghan historians. However, this name is no longer used.\nDescription.\nThe river's total length is and its drainage basin totals in area, providing a mean discharge of around of water per year. The river is navigable for over . All of the water comes from the high mountains in the south where annual precipitation can be over . Even before large-scale irrigation began, high summer evaporation meant that not all of this discharge reached the Aral Sea \u2013 though there is some evidence the large Pamir glaciers provided enough meltwater for the Aral to overflow during the 13th and 14th centuries.\nSince the end of the 19th century there have been four different claimants as the true source of the Oxus:\nA glacier turns into the Wakhan River and joins the Pamir River about downstream. Bill Colegrave's expedition to Wakhan in 2007 found that both claimants 2 and 3 had the same source, the Chelab stream, which bifurcates on the watershed of the Little Pamir, half flowing into Lake Chamaktin and half into the parent stream of the Little Pamir/Sarhad River. Therefore, the Chelab stream may be properly considered the true source or parent stream of the Oxus. The Panj River forms the border of Afghanistan and Tajikistan. It flows west to Ishkashim where it turns north and then north-west through the Pamirs passing the Tajikistan\u2013Afghanistan Friendship Bridge. It subsequently forms the border of Afghanistan and Uzbekistan for about , passing Termez and the Afghanistan\u2013Uzbekistan Friendship Bridge. It delineates the border of Afghanistan and Turkmenistan for another before it flows into Turkmenistan at Atamurat. It flows across Turkmenistan south to north, passing T\u00fcrkmenabat, and forms the border of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan from Halkabat. It is then split by the Tuyamuyun Hydro Complex into many waterways that used to form the river delta joining the Aral Sea, passing Urgench, Da\u015foguz, and other cities, but it does not reach what is left of the sea any more and is lost in the desert. Use of water from the Amu Darya for irrigation has been a major contributing factor to the shrinking of the Aral Sea since the late 1950s. Historical records state that in different periods, the river flowed into the Aral Sea (from the south), into the Caspian Sea (from the east), or both, similar to the Syr Darya (Jaxartes, in Ancient Greek).\nWatershed.\nThe of the Amu Darya drainage basin include most of Tajikistan, the southwest corner of Kyrgyzstan, the northeast corner of Afghanistan, a narrow portion of eastern Turkmenistan and the western half of Uzbekistan. Part of the Amu Darya basin divide in Tajikistan forms that country's border with China (in the east) and Pakistan (to the south). About 61% of the drainage lies within Tajikistan, Uzbekistan and Turkmenistan, while 39% is in Afghanistan.\nThe abundant water flowing in the Amu Darya comes almost entirely from glaciers in the Pamir Mountains and Tian Shan,\nwhich, standing above the surrounding arid plain, collect atmospheric moisture which otherwise would probably escape somewhere else. Without its mountain water sources, the Amu Darya would not exist\u2014because it rarely rains in the lowlands through which most of the river flows. Of the total drainage area only about actively contribute water to the river.\nThis is because many of the river's major tributaries (especially the Zeravshan River) have been diverted, and much of the river's drainage is arid. Throughout most of the steppe, the annual rainfall is about .\nHistory.\nThe ancient Greeks called the Amu Darya the \"Oxus\". In ancient times, the river was regarded as the boundary between Greater Iran and \u1e6a\u016br\u0101n (). The river's drainage lies in the area between the former empires of Genghis Khan and Alexander the Great, although they occurred at very different times. When the Mongols came to the area, they used the water of the Amu Darya to flood Konye-Urgench. One southern route of the Silk Road ran along part of the Amu Darya northwestward from Termez before going westwards to the Caspian Sea.\nIt is believed that the Amu Darya's course across the Karakum Desert has gone through several major shifts in the past few thousand years. Much of the time \u2013 most recently from the 13th century to the late 16th century \u2013 the Amu Darya emptied into both the Aral and the Caspian Seas, reaching the latter via a large distributary called the Uzboy River. The Uzboy splits off from the main channel just south of the river's delta. Sometimes the flow through the two branches was more or less equal, but often most of the Amu Darya's flow split to the west and flowed into the Caspian.\nPeople began to settle along the lower Amu Darya and the Uzboy in the 5th century, establishing a thriving chain of agricultural lands, towns, and cities. In about AD 985, the massive Gurganj Dam at the bifurcation of the forks started to divert water to the Aral. Genghis Khan's troops destroyed the dam in 1221, and the Amu Darya shifted to distributing its flow more or less equally between the main stem and the Uzboy. But in the 18th century, the river again turned north, flowing into the Aral Sea, a path it has taken since. Less and less water flowed down the Uzboy. When Russian explorer Bekovich-Cherkasski surveyed the region in 1720, the Amu Darya did not flow into the Caspian Sea anymore.\nBy the 1800s, the ethnographic makeup of the region was described by Peter Kropotkin as the communities of \"the vassal Khanates of Maimene, Khulm, Kunduz, and even the Badakshan and Wahkran.\" An Englishman, William Moorcroft, visited the Oxus around 1824 during the Great Game period. Another Englishman, a naval officer called John Wood, came with an expedition to find the source of the river in 1839. He found modern-day Lake Zorkul, called it Lake Victoria, and proclaimed he had found the source. Then, the French explorer and geographer Thibaut Vin\u00e9 collected a lot of information about this area during five expeditions between 1856 and 1862.\nThe question of finding a route between the Oxus valley and India has been of concern historically. A direct route crosses extremely high mountain passes in the Hindu Kush and isolated areas like Kafiristan. Some in Britain feared that the Empire of Russia, which at the time wielded great influence over the Oxus area, would overcome these obstacles and find a suitable route through which to invade British India \u2013 but this never came to pass. The area was taken over by Russia during the Russian conquest of Turkestan.\nThe Soviet Union became the ruling power in the early 1920s and expelled Mohammed Alim Khan. It later put down the Basmachi movement and killed Ibrahim Bek. A large refugee population of Central Asians, including Turkmen, Tajiks and Uzbeks, fled to northern Afghanistan. In the 1960s and 1970s the Soviets started using the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya to irrigate extensive cotton fields in the Central Asian plain. Before this time, water from the rivers was already being used for agriculture, but not on this massive scale. The Qaraqum Canal, Karshi Canal, and Bukhara Canal were among the larger of the irrigation diversions built. However, the Main Turkmen Canal, which would have diverted water along the dry Uzboy River bed into central Turkmenistan, was never built. The 1970s, in the course of the Soviet\u2013Afghan War, Soviet forces used the valley to invade Afghanistan through Termez. The Soviet Union fell in the 1990s and Central Asia split up into the many smaller countries that lie within or partially within the Amu Darya basin.\nDuring the Soviet era, a resource-sharing system was instated in which Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan shared water originating from the Amu and Syr Daryas with Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan in summer. In return, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan received Kazakh, Turkmen, and Uzbek coal, gas, and electricity in winter. After the fall of the Soviet Union this system disintegrated and the Central Asian nations have failed to reinstate it. Inadequate infrastructure, poor water-management, and outdated irrigation methods all exacerbate the issue.\nSiberian Tiger Introduction Project.\nThe Caspian tiger used to occur along the river's banks. After its extirpation, the Darya's delta was suggested as a potential site for the introduction of its closest surviving relative, the Siberian tiger. A feasibility study was initiated to investigate if the area is suitable and if such an initiative would receive support from relevant decision makers. A viable tiger population of about 100 animals would require at least of large tracts of contiguous habitat with rich prey populations. Such habitat is not available at this stage and cannot be provided in the short term. The proposed region is therefore unsuitable for the reintroduction, at least at this stage.\nLiterature.\nThe Oxus river, and Arnold's poem, fire the imaginations of the children who adventure with ponies over the moors of the West Country in the 1930s children's book \"The Far-Distant Oxus\". There were two sequels, \"Escape to Persia\" and \"Oxus in Summer\".\nRobert Byron's 1937 travelogue, \"The Road to Oxiana\", describes its author's journey from the Levant through Persia to Afghanistan, with the Oxus as his stated goal.\nGeorge MacDonald Fraser's \"Flashman at the Charge\", (1973), places Flashman on the Amu Darya and the Arral Sea during the (fictitious) Russian advance on India during The Great Game period."}
